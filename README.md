# **Sentiment Analysis in Healthcare**  

## **Objective**  
With the growing availability of patient reviews, Sentiment Analysis is becoming a crucial tool in the healthcare industry. This project introduces an automated Sentiment Analysis technique to extract meaningful insights from patient feedback, ensuring **high accuracy and minimal computational cost**. The goal is to assist healthcare governing bodies in making **data-driven decisions** by analyzing real-time textual data.  

## **Methods**  
- **Data Collection:** Extracted patient reviews from public websites spanning **5 years**.  
- **Text Analysis:** Applied **Word Clouds** and **n-grams** to identify trends, patterns, and key themes.  
- **Preprocessing & Exploration:** Used Python libraries for **data cleaning, distribution analysis, and feature engineering**.  
- **Handling Imbalance:** Implemented **data augmentation** followed by **under-sampling** to address dataset imbalance.  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Trained **two BERT variants**:  
    - BERT for Sequence Classification  
    - Custom BERT Model  
  - **Custom BERT achieved 88% accuracy**, outperforming traditional sentiment analysis methods.  

## **Results & Impact**  
- Our method enables **real-time sentiment analysis**, providing healthcare providers with **actionable insights**.  
- The **Custom BERT model** outperformed traditional approaches, demonstrating **higher accuracy and efficiency**.  
- This approach can enhance **patient care quality** by helping policymakers understand patient sentiment **at scale**.
