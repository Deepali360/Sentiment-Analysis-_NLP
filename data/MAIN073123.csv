Alexandra,4 weeks to get appointment,7/10/2018,4,"Trying to get an appointment is very difficult and can take up to 4 weeks. On the day (at 8am) I can be ringing for 1/2 an hour and once through there are no appointments left. However, once you do see the GP/Nurse, they are very lovely and so I cannot fault them."
Alexandra,40 mins behind today,4/3/2020,3,"If you are late you lose your appointment, but sitting here 40 mins after the appointment time is far too long without anyone telling you anything. There is no information on the check-in screen to say they are behind, but if you knew you would not think you’d been forgotten. It’s atrocious being treated like this.
If I hadn’t taken this appointment it would be another 2 weeks before they could get me in."
Alexandra,Absolutely appalling,11/20/2020,2,"Had about a short phone call with a doctor who simply didn't listen too my needs telling her I cannot take paracetamol as doesnt even touch my pain, for her to then tell me to take paracetamol 4 times a day. Doctors don't look back through notes. What a absolute joke!"
Alexandra,access to GP,8/24/2021,3,"Access to a GP here is near on impossible. You get someone non-medical telling you whats what and deciding your eligible or not for a call back in days, not that day. So an appointment from when you originally called is ages away."
Alexandra,Amazing,3/31/2023,5,My little girl has chicken pox but it’s in her eye. I was called and referred to hospital within 2 hours. I know Rhine’s are hard but I’d like to thank you. The future could have left her with sight problems left untreated. Thank you
Alexandra,Appointment system is rubbish,1/24/2019,1,I have recently tried to book an appointment for a non emergency knowing how busy the surgery is I phoned up from work with my rota in front of me for the next few weeks. I was more than happy to wait a couple of weeks if needed. To be told that appointments can only be booked on the day. Now this is no use to me when I work 6 days a week an hour away from the surgery. I don't understand how this new system helps working people get an appointment to see a doctor. To state I can get a appointment anytime of day if you phone is also rubbish. It takes ages for them to answer the phone and then to be told they have no appointments left I wasn't best pleased. You offer a service and you are failing to meet this.
Alexandra,Appointments can be tricky to get,7/3/2019,4,"Today I'm here for a medication review, and they contacted me via text which was good, as I would not have known when the review should be.
To get an 'on the day' appointment can be very difficult, calling in the morning and afternoon, the line is engaged and then when you eventually get through all the appointments are gone."
Alexandra,Awful,10/14/2019,1,82 year old mother tried to phone get an appointment today by the time she got through all appointments gone told to go to surgery at 8 am on Friday dreadful.
Alexandra,Bad attitude,9/23/2022,3,"My medication was delayed and I was with my support worker talking to reception trying to resolve this. I stated that I had a lot going on and their response was 'don't we all!' This has happened twice now and I end up without my medication for a week which in turn affects my mental health, which goes downhill. People need to understand the impact of these delays and they need to show some empathy rather than this kind of attitude."
Alexandra,Bad service,7/8/2021,1,"Waiting on a signed form for nearly a month now.  They tried booking my mum in for a blood test when she just had one a week ago.  Review over the phone it rang 3 times and hung up, no time to get my phone out of my bag."
Alexandra,Brilliant service,3/20/2019,5,"didn't have to wait long, nurse very helpful"
Alexandra,Call in a week!,8/24/2021,2,"After calling 111 from having a few days (more than 5) of diarrhea, I was told that as my surgery is open I needed to access them first and call them to try see someone. They then told me to go to the pharmacist if I can and they will give me a call back in a week! I went to the pharmacist who gave me electrolytes.  I was advised to go back to the surgery as things had gone on so long they should be taking a sample from me, however this was not the case, and they should be as I am aware that this should be reported when someone has this for this length of time. But they did not."
Alexandra,Came here from Crestview,7/3/2019,2,"Came over to Alexandra road from Crestview, this has happened 3 times this year and I'll be seeing a nurse practitioner which I'm fine with. 
I hadn't previously known about extended hours, but now I do."
Alexandra,Can usually see a GP/Nurse in two days,4/30/2015,5,Friendly and helpful Receptionists.
Alexandra,Can’t even get them to answer the phone,5/29/2019,1,Phones never get answered been waiting months still nothing absolute joke
Alexandra,Communication with new GP wasn't there,6/5/2018,3,"Have been at this surgery for years and saw the same GP, who was excellent. One day he just left and the next GP I saw knew nothing about my condition. I moved surgeries as a result of this poor communication."
Alexandra,Compassionate,8/13/2021,5,"All staff are kind, caring and compassionate. They do, and give of their best to ensure positive outcomes for the patients in their care ."
Alexandra,Costs too much to call,9/23/2022,3,It costs me too much to ring now. £5 each time as on 'pay as you go' so I have to walk-in which they get funny about. I have no wi-fi to go online and cannot afford 'data.' Other services I call have a 'fixed charge'. For example when I ring to get my oxygen its 30p for each call. They need to think of those on lower income.
Alexandra,Diabolical,6/30/2021,1,"Both me and my husband tried to contact the surgery, 45 minutes till someone answered the phone. And still not helpful. My husband does not use computers so depends on me and I work full time. They say medication can be prescribed once they speak to you on the phone and yet we are still waiting for this phone call!!!  3 days later How long can they keep blaming this on the Covid?"
Alexandra,Difficult to call at 8am,7/3/2019,3,As a mother of 4 I find it difficult to phone the surgery in the mornings when needed due to doing the school run.  Often when I have 'phoned back they have no appointments left.  This is frustrating as it puts off being able to see the nurse/Doctor even more.  It's a shame the option to book appointments in advance is no longer available.
Alexandra,Disgraceful,10/1/2019,1,I waited an hour for my appointment to see the doctor and got seen by a nurse. Booked an appointment the next day for another doctor not of the practice contracts and was not even seen at all.
Alexandra,Disgraceful service,2/15/2019,1,"All I wanted was advice and help. But apparently the receptionists are now medically qualified to tell you what treatment you can or more to the point cannot have. I pay my taxes, national insurance etc. and I expect a better service than that."
Alexandra,Don’t feel they are any good,4/3/2020,3,"Based I’m my experience which is difficult to share in public area, I find GP’s and Nurse Practitioner I have seen not good at all.
Not getting any answers to my needs."
Alexandra,dreadful extremely bad service,2/17/2021,1,"My partner has damaged his shoulder,and after a telephone appointment a face to face appointment was booked then cancelled by the practice to be made the following week,when my partner called to confirm he was then told it would be another telephone appointment.meanwhile he has been left in extreme pain.due to this incompetency i am going to have to go against the practice advice ant take him to A&E.i undrestand covid is putting a strain on the nhs but as a frontline worker myself i am disgusted that he is allowed to go on in such pain.westoft"
Alexandra,Emergency appointments are available,7/3/2019,4,"If I need an 'emergency' appointment, in my experience the system here has worked well. If I need something 'routine' that can mean a long wait.
The staff are helpful and being asked extra questions when making an appointment makes sense.
I have now learned about extended hours."
Alexandra,Excellent discussion with (name removed),10/24/2022,5,"Met with relevant staff member (name removed) to make some negative observations, but came away with a better   understanding and appreciation."
Alexandra,Excellent. Communication very good.,7/8/2017,5,"Doctor attended to see service user, discussing what was best. Allowed her to have input, also care staff.  Friendly, professional and courteous."
Alexandra,Fair but long wait for appointment.,8/14/2017,3,The only problem was had to wait 5 weeks for an appointment
Alexandra,Fantastic care after bilateral knee operation,5/16/2022,5,The surgery have been brilliant with aftercare since I have had bilateral knee replacement surgery. They have made sure that they have responded quickly when I have sent a message asking for pain relief and seem genuinely interested in my progress. Thanks to all at Crestview Surgery.
Alexandra,found things good this time,8/25/2021,3,"The surgery is not really consistent. I have in the past had a lot of difficulty getting an appointment and these are for things that needed attention, and examination however last week I did get a ring back and have now got in to see someone today.  It is like you get 1 in 4 experiences that are ok, but the rest is not great at all."
Alexandra,Four week wait,6/10/2016,4,"I do not use the surgery that often. Last time I did need to get an appointment it took four weeks to get one, which I feel is unacceptable but also a clear sign of the change to the growth of the community without the needed infrastructure being thought of."
Alexandra,Friendly supportive help and advice,6/24/2020,5,"I attended for routine screening and saw a practice nurse . The nursing staff are outstanding and provide a professional approach . Although my appointment was late , the nurse was apologetic, and reassuring. She dealt with me very sensitively and was efficient and professional in very difficult circumstances ."
Alexandra,Getting appointment on the day is impossible,12/4/2018,4,"Booking appointment 'on the day' - you can forget that! I get 4 to 5 weeks delay for an appointment. Surgery runs 15 - 20 minutes late, which is ok, I guess?"
Alexandra,Given time by GP,8/25/2021,4,"When I have seen a GP they don't stick to the 10 minutes allocation, they have time for you and so I don't mind waiting in my appointment as I feel confident that they've been thorough and feel like they care. It is however, rare that you get to see a GP."
Alexandra,Good advice from receptionist,6/22/2017,5,Advice from receptionist re repeat scripts.  No problems - very helpful
Alexandra,GPs change,6/3/2016,3,"I hate the change of GPs every few months, they come but they don't stay!"
Alexandra,great nusing staff,1/15/2020,5,"no wait to be seen, polite staff, clean waiting area
Review appointment booked with no hassle."
Alexandra,I can’t even get an appointment,5/29/2019,1,"Iv been registered with this doctor for 30 years, only needing the service once or twice, now I need a doctor I can’t get to see one. The online help is a joke, I need to see a doctor but have to wait to register before I can even attempt to make an appointment. No wonder our hospitals are over worked, guess that where I’ll be heading tomorrow to take away services that needed elsewhere. Well done Crestview surgery 5 star mess up."
Alexandra,I’m based at Crestview,10/17/2019,3,"Today I was told by the lady on prescriptions that I couldn’t have my ADS and needed to make an appointment for a review.  I felt very panicked tbh as I had no tablets left, she asked me to go to the front desk.  I was very uncomfortable chest felt tight and the lovely lady on the front desk not only sorted out my prescription with the chemist but also informed me my review is not until January.  So basically the woman who was in prescriptions was totally wrong and caused me stress and anxiety for no reason."
Alexandra,Impossible to get appointments.,10/30/2020,1,"Even a 3 minute telephone appointment is apparently too much to ask nowadays.  I don't necessarily blame the staff, more the time wasters using up appointments for every little minor ailment,  so when people genuinely need help they can't get it."
Alexandra,impossible to get through on phone,8/15/2019,1,Terrible attitude from receptionist
Alexandra,Incorrect diagnosis twice,7/12/2018,5,"Back in July took my son to the surgery several times because my son was unwell with a cough. Was prescribed antibiotics for a throat infection he got progressively worse ended up being admitted to hospital after a trip to A&E with pneumonia. Now we have a similar situation. My son taking to surgery on Tuesday this week with severe cough. Told throat and chest fine, again another trip to A&E this morning to discover he actually has a chest infection!!"
Alexandra,Information could be improved...,8/16/2018,4,"I asked for an appointment in 6, when suffering from stress-related issues and was told that I could not see my doctor until the beginning of August. Few questions were asked when I phoned and I was concerned about this at the time. I would politely suggest that the staff taking appointments could be trained to demonstrate a better understanding of mental health needs.

After having my appointment, which involved having a blood test (which was carried out with a great degree of care), I was unsure about how I would be informed of the results. To be fair, I was informed by the nurse to ring the surgery if I hadn't heard by the Monday of the following week. However, I didn't do this and I have had no contact from anyone regarding the results. I tried to look up 'blood test results' in your Search facility on your website but it gave no information and I could find nothing about this topic anywhere obvious on your site. I shall phone to ask for my results now but I feel the information you provide could be better.

Finally, I feel that you should put some general information about mental health issues and how to refer mental health issues on your website. There's currently an empty web page under the hyperlinked topic on the site. Mental health services are an area of the NHS that is clearly under a lot of strain but some of the issues could be helped by the provision of better information and better handling of mental health concerns.

Thank you for all your help, as always."
Alexandra,I've been trying to call them for 2  hours,4/15/2019,2,Line is always busy. It's impossible to speak with someone
Alexandra,Joined practise end of 2018. ALL staff have b,3/17/2019,5,Compared to my last practise in GY I cannot fault the surgery. With complex medical history my husband and I feel reassured by prompt repeat scripts. Late appts. Same day appts. Understanding staff. Extras such as diabetic and cancer nurses. Pharmacist checks. Blood tests. Existing patients may take these for granted we certainly don't. We have also found receptionists to be empathetic and helpful. Glad we found you.
Alexandra,Just awful,4/3/2020,1,I get fed up of being palmed off. Sent from Crestview today and on restricted parking today. Appointment is 40 mins behind so I’m getting anxious about it now.
Alexandra,Lack of doctors,2/21/2022,1,Can never see a doctor and get fobbed off with phone calls from healthcare assistants which whilst pleasant enough freely admit they aren't the people I need to speak to.
Alexandra,Left crying being asked why exempt mask,9/17/2020,1,"Visited Alexandra Road surgery today as I had to pick a prescription up. Whilst there, I tried to make a face to face appointment with a doctor, rather than a phonecall as had already tried this but a nurse called me earlier today and reluctantly prescribed some meds hence what I was picking up.

The nurse was going to leave me the whole weekend before a doctor calls me; which is what I needed in the first place! I am a young intelligent female who needs some support and I do not feel my well being needs are being met. 

I’m 1 month off 20 years worth antidepressants and need some relief for my anxiety such as lorazepam. The nurse reluctantly agreed only 7 days worth until doctor speaks to me. Again, something that could of been dealt with it the dr had called me as originally requested. 

Explained to the receptionist that I am exempt from wearing a mask, she continued to ask why why why when I was tearful as i was. 
Checked the GOV website, clearly states no one should continuously ask you why as an exempt person. I was rescinded to tears, even the chemist lady asked if I was okay, clearly wasn’t, and this wasn’t even dealing with my personal affairs and why I need an appointment! 
Left the practice feeling extremely upset. Called the other practice, explained what had happened and she was even worse! Told me they are not a government building, they have their own rules! 
Please for your own intelligence, check the latest guidance. The GOV blankets you guys, not the other way round. 


Corrected her and advised that the government overrule all business etc for those who require to wear a mask AND those who don’t. You can not refuse to see someone who are exempt not in black and white do we need a doctor to add it to our medical records.  

Unfortunately the government are the ones who make the rules which I respect you have to follow to your best practice, however you need to accommodate those who exempt too. If you do not have anything in place, are you putting us all the wayside??? The mental health will only get worse and with that treatment I’m worried what will happen to others well being!! 

Asked what is in place for those who are exempt and she could not answer the question, basically refusing to help someone who is struggling with their mental wellbeing, and clearly a situation that needs to be avoided on my next visit. 

Utterly speechless and disgraced."
Alexandra,Left waiting for over 35 minutes,3/29/2023,1,"I arrived at the surgery at 9:20 a.m. to keep a 9:30 appointment, there were no staff on reception, and a notice on the automatic booking in system just said ""Out of Order"". I took a seat and waited until past 10:05 a.m., I then queried with reception why I had not been seen, and was told I should have booked in with them, and that I had been registered as non attending. Surely, somebody with common sense, would have added an instruction to consult reception to the ""out of order"" notice."
Alexandra,Locum NP didn’t fill me with confidence,4/3/2020,2,"Told by hospital to get dressing done on a Friday, so called surgery on Wednesday to make an appointment, but was told to ring on the day I needed it. So called on the Friday only to be met with ‘you’ve left that a bit late haven’t you.’ They did get me in with a Locum nurse practitioner who told me she was not up to speed on doing dressings and she didn’t know where anything was in the cupboards! This was not what I needed to hear.
She actually ended up doing a great job of it, but felt it was rather bizarre situation."
Alexandra,Meds not aligned,9/23/2022,3,"It is annoying that my medications are not aligned so that I can pick everything up in one go. I did try the Proof of Delivery, but it took too long on the phone and I work full time, so cannot hang on the phone for this. I waited more than 20 minutes on my lunch break and did not get through, so it is difficult."
Alexandra,misinformation - at best ingenuous,3/17/2019,2,Told by doctor that testing blood sugars causes anxiety.  Personally I find it motivating and have lowered my HbA1c to non diabetic levels despite poor advise - Other poor advise / care given.  The surgery feels like a sausage factory for the sick.
Alexandra,Mixed experience,6/7/2018,3,I had to go to A&E today due to calling into surgery and being fobbed off. Receptionist was very rude. I like the online system for advanced appointments but on the day ones are very difficult to get. We are unable to get to Crestview due to transport issues.
Alexandra,Mixed experience with prescriptions,12/4/2018,4,"Prescriptions - some pick up here and find have to get other prescription from Crestview too. We pick up the medication in High Street pharmacy. We do not use the online system as so many times the medication can be the wrong type. With allergies to some, I need consistency in the tablets. If they change the make of the tablet, I often have a reaction."
Alexandra,More and more difficult to get in,5/3/2020,3,"This surgery seems to have gone from terrible to really terrible for being able to get in. I have had to go to Crestview before, which was ok, but reliant on family for a lift.
They are obviously short staffed otherwise why would it be so difficult to get an appointment with just anyone, not even a GP, it is difficult all round"
Alexandra,Next in line to answer phone for 11 mins!,6/11/2019,1,Not the first time I have tried to ring and waited ages for a reply when I am supposed to be next in line.
Alexandra,No answer,1/29/2019,1,"Rang 200 times in one phone and 93 on another to make my sick child an appointment and couldn't get through. This is disgusting, unprofessional, unacceptable and it makes me curious to why a doctors with so many patients has one line to call. Get more numbers and your practice might come out with better reviews!!!!"
Alexandra,No clarity on extended hours services,7/3/2019,4,"This is my day off so fortunately I was able to get in, but only because I queued up this morning. It would be good if I could see someone after work. 
I was then told about extended hours service, I'd never heard of this before, never been told either here or elsewhere.
Surely that would hep the surgery as I'd happily go to an appointment later in the evening or even at the weekend and then my daytime appointment would be available for someone who couldn't do that."
Alexandra,No communication never get appointments,6/17/2019,1,Not only did our appointment get cancelled no one bothered to contact us and ringing up every morning for an appointment is a ridiculous idea as been trying to get an appointment for weeks but every morning ufter 30min of waiting in a que when it get to me there's never an appointment
Alexandra,No consistent GP,7/10/2018,3,"With GP's leaving here recently, I have been moved about between  a couple since December. With my hearing being bad I find it difficult to hear a GP that usually doesn't see that I am wearing a hearing aid. They do not always speak clearly. Takes a month to get an appointment with the GP I am with and I got told I am now not seeing them as they have also left."
Alexandra,No face-to-face contact with GPs,11/15/2021,1,"My stepfather is unable to obtain an appointment to see his GP. A callback is not an appointment to see your GP, an offer to come in and see the nurse practitioner (after complaining to the receptionists about their blocking tactics) is not an appointment to see your GP.  My stepfather is in need of a face-to-face appointment. You cannot perform remote diagnostics via a telephone call."
Alexandra,"no help for techno phobs,autistic or dyslexic",1/9/2020,1,phoned to get help for my sons fit note as he is autistic and i get told do it on the website. I was talking to someone who could have helped and stopped all stress and worry.
Alexandra,No issues,7/10/2018,5,"Never had any problem getting an appointment.
I always have been able to get my blood test done in time."
Alexandra,No issues,7/10/2018,5,"I always get an appointment when I need one here.They are aware of my medical conditions, so perhaps that is why as I know it is an issue for others at the same surgery."
Alexandra,No offer of extended hours,7/3/2019,3,"Can never see the same person twice!
I called in the morning and was told to call again in the afternoon. Each time I was told no appointments were available. I said I'd go to A&E as I felt that bad, but was told to call again the next day!!
I then learned about 'extended hours' - why had the surgery not offered me this, or even mentioned it? I would happily go. Next time I will ask for this."
Alexandra,Normally go to Crestview,5/3/2020,3,"I parked and put one hour on my car.  It is now 40 mins past my appointment time and I am getting worried I will have to forfeit the appointment. I did come over from the Crestview surgery area as they had nothing there. It is easy there as it is on my doorstep.  This appointment was made 2 weeks ago and I HAVE to see someone, so it is stressing me that I may have to go just because they are not running even close to time."
Alexandra,Not confident I'd see a GP,9/23/2022,4,"I have no confidence that if I needed a GP that I would get to see one. The general feeling here is that they have little capacity for GP's and you see someone else. I have seen a Nurse for my stitches, which I know is right for that, but I do worry that things could be missed if I got very unwell and with my health conditions, that is likely in the near future."
Alexandra,Not great,8/24/2021,3,"This surgery has not been brilliant for access for quite a while and when the pandemic hit it just got harder to see someone who can help you face to face. I do not do online, so I have to wait for a few days to even get a call back by someone. No day given, no time given, you are at their mercy. You have your life to live each day and cannot be hanging about because you may get a call that day that if you miss won't happen again."
Alexandra,Not right person,9/23/2022,3,"I saw a Nurse who could not prescribe and no GP was available so had to re-book with GP. This has doubled the time, two trips for me and a wasted appointment with the Nurse. I did say when I called that I needed to see a GP due to the nature of what I knew would be required. They need to listen and take on board what a patient says as we do know more about ourselves than they do when they issue these appointments"
Alexandra,Not too bad,8/24/2021,4,"I do not have much of an issue as I do not use the service very much, so for me, it is not too bad. I use the online system as it is easy to use, rather than hanging on the telephone too long. What could be better is being given a slot to expect the ring back."
Alexandra,On going problem for the last 5 wks,12/16/2020,1,Had the wrong medication 3 times now. Sent online request for appt on Sunday and am still waiting to hear anything despite talking to 2 receptionists the past 2 days.
Alexandra,on site pharmacist great,8/25/2021,4,"Found a call with the on site pharmacist excellent, eve so much as I asked if I could speak with them again, but unfortunately was unavailable.  They just have more time for the less complex stuff."
Alexandra,On the day appointment is difficult,12/4/2018,4,"Surgery is really good. I've experienced trouble getting an appointment on the day for my child, which was frustrating."
Alexandra,Online booking,6/6/2016,4,"I have used the online booking system. Often there is one early appointment available, then none for 3 or 4 weeks.I presume the early appointment is a result of a cancellation.If an early appointment is not available and you book a later on you cannot look again to see if there has been a cancellation. The system is not set up to be patient friendly."
Alexandra,Online works well,8/25/2021,5,The online service works well for me and I gained an appointment within 4 days of initial submission. They emailed me and text me an I was even seen slightly early at my appointment. The person I saw sorted out the issue (not a GP).
Alexandra,Phone call: rude on phone,10/10/2018,1,"Cancelled an appointment for my wife and the receptionist was very rude on the phone stating that someone else could of had the appointment, when doctors say to call up to cancel to save their time! Not happy, thinking about leaving the practice,"
Alexandra,Please give more info on staff skills,7/3/2019,3,"I cannot remember the last time I saw a GP. I'm waiting to see the nurse practitioner. When I found out what the skill set of the nurse practitioner was I was very surprised, why doesn't the surgery share this to help patients understand?"
Alexandra,Please make extended hours available,7/3/2019,4,"If I go to the GPs with my child, who has complex health issues, we get an appointment with a GP. However, if it's for me then it's less easy to get any kind of appointment.
Then I learned of extended hours and was surprised that I hadn't been offered this option. I don't mind seeing any GP at a different venue if necessary but this has never been offered."
Alexandra,Pleased with care; appointment is difficult,6/7/2018,4,"Booking an appointment 'on the day' - you can forget that! i get 4 to 5 weeks delay for an appointment. Surgery runs 15 - 20 mins late, which is ok, I guess."
Alexandra,Pleased with care; issues with medication,6/7/2018,4,"Prescriptions - some pick up here and find have to get other prescriptions from crestview too. We pick up the medication in High Street Pharmacy. We do not use the online system as so many times, the medication can be the wrong type. With allergies to some, I need consistency in the tablets. if they change the make of the tablet, I often have a reaction. We have sorted most of it out now, but it does still happen occasionally where some of the paper prescriptions are between the two surgeries. We go through it meticulously to ensure all is correct on the prescription and at the pharmacy before leaving with it so to ensure there is no wastage."
Alexandra,Poor,6/11/2020,1,"Difficult to speak to anyone, staff on the phone are very unhelpful, cannot get an appointment to see a doctor"
Alexandra,Poor,9/30/2019,1,If I could find out who you have to sleep with or bribe to get an appointment here it might help.  Any clues?
Alexandra,Poor,8/30/2018,1,Patients who like having a booked appointment do not wish to ring on the day unless it is an emergency
Alexandra,Prescription management isn't good,7/3/2019,3,"My medication wasn't signed for in time for a painkiller I have to get a repeat for on a weekly basis to be issues. Boots pharmacy usually deal with this, but recently I went to pick up my medication and it hadn't been signed yet, so I had a gap in my medication."
Alexandra,"Receptionists unhelpful, unfriendly,abrupt",5/15/2019,1,Pharmacist failed to arrange important medication leaving me without medication for a number of days.
Alexandra,Refusal of face to face gp,5/19/2021,1,Refusal of face to face go appointment despite being very ill with lung condition so need to be seen. Told had to wait a week and only given a phone call appointment.
Alexandra,Refusal to see me with my premature baby,4/3/2020,3,I was told to go to a pharmacy when I was worried about my baby who was premature. I did manage in the end to see the health visitor who was surprised by the refusal as she said it was appropriate to have asked to see the GP.
Alexandra,Rude & on the day appointments are difficult,12/4/2018,3,Had to go to A&E today due to calling into surgery and being fobbed off. Receptionist was very rude. I use the online system for advanced appointments but on-the-day ones are very difficult to get. We are unable to get to Crestview due to transport issues.
Alexandra,Rude receptionist is not acceptable,4/3/2020,3,"There is one receptionist Who is continually so rude in how she speaks to you on the telephone or if you walk in. 
You get offered an appointment in 2 weeks which when you are ill that day is no good to anyone. Getting told ‘that’s the way it is’ is just not acceptable."
Alexandra,Rude receptionist no call back,12/8/2019,1,Rude receptionists would not give me their name so I could complain about telephone manner. Not the first time I've experienced this. Asked for an advice call at 8am still waiting at 1830. Call up to ask when I will be rung and rude receptionist says probably tomorrow. I said I don't think that's acceptable as I need to be spoken to today by a doctor. Hence why I called and requested a call back for that day. No call back ever came.
Alexandra,Rude unprofessional receptionists,7/4/2022,2,"Recently in March 22  spent ten minutes waiting for the phone to be answered only for the receptionist to say hello and then immediately put the phone down on me, called again and this time had to wait twenty minutes for phone to be answered - was ringing to cancel appointment as had covid - this is not the first time this has happened to me - absolutely shocking customer service!!!  Haven't managed to see Doctor for years.."
Alexandra,Rude with no bedside manner!,9/5/2019,1,"My mum visited the surgery today. She currently has a chest infection and is very breathless. She is a known COPD patient.
My sister made the appointment and was present with her throughout the visit. 
It started by the doctor calling my mums name from the surgery door. The doctor was not visible at any stage so thankfully my sister heard her name. Is this appropriate? 
Once the doctor sat down, they did not move from their chair, or introduce themself, and had limited conversation.
The doctor did not explain or even announce the assessment that they were about to carry out.
The doctor just placed their stethoscope in their ears and my mum had to stand up and move towards them so they could listen to her chest. At no stage did the doctor move off their chair. This also happened when they took my mum's temperature. 
Surely the doctor should be off their chair and approach my mum when taking observations. This caused more distress to my mum which did not help with her breathlessness.
My sister had to ask the outcome of the assessment.
My sister was happy with the outcome however had to ask. We both feel the appropriate medications was prescribed.
Once my sister and mum left the room they both commented how unfriendly the doctor was and felt they did not want to be there.
I'm a trained nurse myself and this practise is unacceptable.
I would like a call from your Practise Manager/Doctor as soon as possible.
I will take this further if not dealt with immediately."
Alexandra,Running late,7/10/2018,4,"Getting an appointment is a challenge on the day. When I checked in the system said the GP is running 3 minutes late, but it is now more than 10 minutes (Which turned into 20 minutes)"
Alexandra,"Running very late, as always",7/3/2019,4,"Running very late, as always.  Difficult to book appointment. Initially getting through then questioned then if lucky you see someone who is free."
Alexandra,Speaking to a care navigator,2/15/2019,1,"On two occasions I had to speak to the same care navigator and I found very unprofessional the way she dealt with my need.The first time I asked whether there is a routine prophylactic clinic to check blood pressure, cholesterol, screening for diabetes.The answer was “No we don’t do that, we have got registered 17000 people, how do you imagine us doing it? To start phoning everyone?”
I felt like I was inconvenience for this receptionist and she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible. No listening to my concerns or referring me to an appropriate place.

Today I went to enquire about syringing ears and the same navigator said”We don’t do that here “and gave me a leaflet to read and interrupted me and started serving the gentleman behind me.I tried than to explain that I have already done this,but she wasn’t interested at all.I think she was didn’t consider our confidentiality.There was a lady leaving an urine sample,me and the gentleman behind me that she was trying to deal with at the sametime.This didn’t feel professional at all and I left again feeling unwelcomed and treated without respect."
Alexandra,Staff have horrible attitude,7/3/2019,1,Trying to get a appointment.  It takes days even after a '111' call.  Staff having a horrible attitude over the 'phone when trying to make a appointment.  Always runs late too.
Alexandra,Surgery is really good,6/7/2018,4,"Surgery is really good. I've experienced trouble getting an appointment on the day difficult for my child, which is frustrating."
Alexandra,System set up for those not at work,6/1/2019,3,"Trying to get an appointment when you work is very difficult.  Always having to call on the day (to help your appointment same day stats only) is next to impossible when you live in Lowestoft but work in Norwich.  Hitting redial when you are driving means that you can only do it when you are stuck in traffic.  This is not safe.    If I could make a planned appointment I could organise to work from home.  I understand that this may not look great on your stats, but rather that roll over to the CQC without stating why you are leaving a % of your appointments for planned appointments, you make life harder for those of us that work.  

I leave for work at 7.30 and I get home around 19.00.  I am a disabled worker and I have also had an illness recently.  

The healthcare I have received has been brilliant.  I don't even mind the ever changing Doctor.  My only issue is with the appointment system. 

A further suggestion would be to have an area to work.  When I get there, to find that the waiting time is 30 minutes, it would be good if I could get some work done, rather that it being dead time.  I have asked if I can go and come back again, but have been told no by the receptionist.  A few desks with wifi would be perfect.  thank you"
Alexandra,Telephone lines need to be better,11/19/2019,3,"Ringing up today was difficult. I rang 50 times on my mobile and finally got through. Our GP is excellent as we have children with medical conditions. Not seeing him today though unfortunately as he is only 3 days a week. He has great bedside manner and says hi if you see him elsewhere.
Another GP just isn’t the same, so that’s not so good.
Seeing Nurse practitioner today."
Alexandra,The staff are lovely,6/7/2018,4,"The staff are lovely and i liked having my regular doctor who retired. I then for last year saw one particular doctor who I got used to, but I have now 'been told' that I'm under another doctor now,who I haven't met yet. It would be nice to be introduced as I need the confidence in my GP."
Alexandra,The staff are lovely,12/4/2018,4,"The staff are lovely and I liked having my regular doctor who retired. I then for last year saw one particular doctor who I got used to, but I have now been told that I'm under another doctor now, who I haven't met yet. Would be nice to be introduced as I need the confidence in my GP."
Alexandra,The wait between is so long,7/10/2018,2,"From my annual check in April, I had a blood test and it took a month to then see the Nurse who then said I needed to see a GP and that also took a month. It is just a long wait between the starting point to the end point.
I have also noted that you do not seem to have a designated doctor any more which I would like."
Alexandra,They don't listen,7/3/2019,4,"Have experienced issues with the surgery after suffering a minor stroke. The hospital stated that I needed a referral but the GP just keeps issuing strong painkillers, which do not really work.
It's difficult when you don't see the same GP twice to keep explaining the situation."
Alexandra,Things are ok,5/3/2020,4,"I personally do not use the service very often, as I look after myself.  I just needed a check up so this was made a few weeks ago, and was not urgent.  So I am seeing a GP, but I know it is only because there is no urgency for it that it worked out alright for me."
Alexandra,Trying to get through is hard,11/19/2019,4,Once you are here it is good. Always have seen same midwife.
Alexandra,Two week wait for poorly son,7/2/2019,3,I booked an appointment a few days ago and there is a two week wait for an appointment. It is for my son who has been sick for a couple of weeks now.
Alexandra,Usually runs on time,7/3/2019,3,Difficult to access at Crestview so I come to Alexandra road. I don't mind as I drive and the surgery usually runs on time. I can barely get an appointment at Crestview.
Alexandra,Very Happy,2/2/2021,5,"Since coming to this surgery I have been well looked after, and dealt with kindness and compassion."
Alexandra,Very Proffessional,3/17/2016,4,"I have found the surgery to be very professional at all times. I do not have any issues currently, and have nothing but praise for them"
Alexandra,Waiting too long,6/10/2016,3,Each time I need to see a doctor (6 times between Jan & May) I have had to wait at least 50 minutes. I know there is a shortage of doctors but I have not seen the same one for more than 6 months
Alexandra,want to move,8/25/2021,3,"I want to move surgeries as this place is just getting worse for access. I called, got a phone call back in a couple of days, but no appointment offered, told to go to the pharmacy, who could not help me and were a bit surprised about me being sent there.  I have called again, I was told to go to pharmacy again, but I had to say that they said it is not them I need to see but my doctor. Reception then argue with you and it is you that are accused of being abusive when all you are doing is telling them what you have been told. It feels like they just say this but have no idea as the pharmacist said I must go back to them. 2 weeks on, still not getting to speak again to a GP it is ridiculous."
Alexandra,went  for review for mediication,5/20/2021,5,"I wish to thank Alexandra  Road surgery for the wonderful care I recieved today before I knew it I was being assessed at Paget,  fluid on lungs causing difficulty  breathing  aria related  thank you all so very much for the care you gave me"
Alexandra,Whole system does not work,7/3/2019,4,Just find the whole system does not work.  If operating 'on the day' only there needs to be more people answering the 'phone.  Do not expect to be questioned in an aggressive way either!
Alexandra,Worst doctors surgery I have ever experienced,7/1/2022,1,"Staff are rude and have no patience. Doctors are rude, dismissive and have no time for you. They don't take the time to listen to your symptoms, talk over you and can't wait to get you out of the door."
Alexandra,Would be nice to see own GP,7/3/2019,4,"It would be nice to see your own GP.  Sometimes it is difficult to get appointments and when you do they run really late.  Seeing your own GP is important when, like me, you have an ongoing condition."
Alexandra,wrong information given,11/19/2019,3,"I saw Nurse practitioner last week who gave me prescription and told me about ‘self certification’ and said if I still feel I need to be off after that, I can call in, speak to receptionist and state that I need a doctors note. So when I did that, reception gave me a ‘information’ line number, which I called and was on hold for 45 minutes. They said that i’d need to make appointment to do that, so I then had to ring the surgery again. I asked about the 1pm time for afternoon appointments and they said they do not do that anymore and all appointments had gone so had to call next day. I was very annoyed as I had called that morning already only to be told to call the info line. So today I called at 8am and got through finally 55mins later. Can however only see a Nurse Practitioner who will not be able to issue a doctors note.
The system ‘stinks’, and the team are giving mixed messages.
Told I need to SEE a GP as it’s my first certificate, yet I’m not seeing one.
I asked for a telephone appointment, as other surgeries do that and that would save everyone time, but no, they do not do that either.
So frustrating.  Meanwhile my employer is waiting for the paperwork."
Andaman Surgery,4* due to waiting times,6/10/2016,4,"It can be 2-3 weeks for an appointment and I have waited 40 minutes in the waiting room too. Generally the care is good care, but if you want to see your own doctor it can take even longer. I usually have to have any doctor going."
Andaman Surgery,A nice surgery overall,6/11/2018,4,"I find the surgery in the main very good at giving me an appointment.  
My only criticism would be that the staff can be a bit short with you when you call to try and make the appointment."
Andaman Surgery,Able to get appointment on the day,6/11/2018,4,I like that I am able to get an appointment at short notice but when I attend the appointment there's usually a 30 minute wait as they are running late.
Andaman Surgery,Adapting to new way difficult,5/8/2021,4,"We are finding the change to not 'seeing' someone difficult.  We recently did manage to get in to see the GP as we had had a long delay for a procedure that should have happened last year. It is something that happens every year at the hospital, or the pain just gets unbearable, which had been the case. Thankfully seeing the GP meant another immediate referral was made for 'high priority' and we are now booked in in the next 2 weeks for the procedure. I am not sure without a face to face examination if the referral would have happened.
CDO reasoned with them that it seems then that appropriately they were seen face to face and immediate action was taken."
Andaman Surgery,Adequate under current situation,9/8/2021,3,"Generally get an appointment when need one. Good link up between school and surgery, but took few weeks to see right person.  As not urgent this was acceptable. I would describe the service overall as 'adequate' as the current situation means, that is all it can be."
Andaman Surgery,Advanced appointments work for me,6/5/2018,4,I am in for an advanced appointment that I booked in advance and find I can see my own GP if i do that. You can be on hold for a while if you call first thing but I understand the situation. Good to know where you are in the queue.
Andaman Surgery,All staff are lovely,1/30/2018,5,"My family have been coming here a number of years. All the staff are lovely, so I do not mind what GP or nurse I see."
Andaman Surgery,Always excellent,5/8/2021,5,"Always found the service excellent. I use the online form and it usually is for something non-urgent, so I tend to get a call back within 2 days, which is fine for non-urgent stuff. You do not know though a timescale, so that may be helpful. I have always got a face to face appointment if I have needed one for either myself or my child. Really good service."
Andaman Surgery,Always pleasant to us,5/8/2021,5,"My husband and I would give this surgery 95%/100%. We get a callback the same day of ringing in and they are always pleasant. I have needed a few appointments in the last few months unfortunately, and they now use my first name, which I like, as adds a personal touch. I personally would not use the online form unless I absolutely had to.  With a hearing aid, I do find one particular person difficult to see as they talk quietly and have an accent. I do have to ask to see someone else but that is not always possible. It just is difficult as I feel rude keeping on saying 'can you speak up.' I do think my record should reflect this, rather than me feel awkward asking to see someone else. Or the member of staff just needs to realise that I need them to talk louder."
Andaman Surgery,Appointment system,1/30/2018,3,Never had a major problem once I actually see a GP. It can be hard to get appointments on the day which often has been detrimental to my health.
Andaman Surgery,Being told several different things,5/1/2022,1,"My little boy is on Gaviscon at the minute for reflux, we were told now that at his age he can be on 2 sachets per bottle, 6 times a day, by one of the series doctors. We have just received a phone called with the head of the practice telling my partner we are ordering way too much and that we are harming our baby by keeping him on it as long as well have, even though we were told by the surgery to keep on giving it to him and only contact them if it stops working. This is unacceptable customer service considering this individual has now made my partner, who also suffers from sever anxiety, feel she has brought hard to our baby, as a result of the surgeries actions."
Andaman Surgery,Blood test service good,8/11/2018,5,Got the appointment in a timely manner.  Today for the blood test.  I do not use service very often though.  It is convenient that it is at the surgery.
Andaman Surgery,Booking an appointment is okay with me,6/5/2018,4,I am not a frequent patient. When I need an appointment I always get one.
Andaman Surgery,Call back is fine,3/29/2023,4,"Even though I wear hearing aids, callback is fine for me as I have bluetooth on my phone. In the surgery, it is difficult to hear when called forward. I do not know if they do have me 'flagged' with hearing loss"
Andaman Surgery,Call back is ok,9/8/2021,4,"Changing to having to have a telephone conversation with someone is ok for me. It does seem like this takes more time though for all parties involved, especially if you end up needing to see someone face to face, which is often the case with myself, and I know this from the start but you have to go through the whole thing first."
Andaman Surgery,Can be touch and go with needles,6/5/2018,4,"They do find it difficult to get a vein most of the time, not just here at this surgery but at the Paget too. It can be difficult as I do have a phobia to them but unfortunately have to have regular tests. The surgery is very convenient for me."
Andaman Surgery,change to POD service,9/8/2021,4,"I wanted to get my prescription as I had done for some time now, via the surgery, and only a week before this change I had picked it up from the surgery after the hospital sent it through.  However, now they wanted me to get it through Prescription order direct, which they had not told me about, so came as a surprise and it is slower to get the medication. A bit of communication about the change before I needed to use it would have been preferable.
Other than this issue, I have always found the surgery excellent"
Andaman Surgery,Clean and staff helpful,11/24/2016,4,Very clean but thee can be a time delay.  Staff are very helpful
Andaman Surgery,Confident they are trying to get answers,1/30/2018,4,"They have been really good at trying to get to the bottom of the problem. I have been referred for numerous MRI scans over the years, I can usually get an appointment when I need one."
Andaman Surgery,Didn't see right person,8/3/2019,3,"They are running more than 40 minutes late, and I was told they were running on time as I came from my workplace after I called and was told this.  I asked to see a GP and was told a Nurse could deal with the issue.  I have now seen the nurse and they have not been unable to prescribe what I need, and I was initially told that they would.  So I have wasted an hour and still got no further, so need to book again with a GP which is what I wanted in the first place."
Andaman Surgery,Different for adults and children,8/11/2018,4,"I rang this morning and was able to get an appointment for my child, however I do not have the same access as an adult."
Andaman Surgery,Doing and checking bloods is fine,6/5/2018,4,Would like to see my own GP. I have my blood taken here too. They now use the fine needle as I used to have to go to James Paget for it and that's what they need and they do that now as long as they know
Andaman Surgery,Easy to make appointments,8/11/2018,4,It is easy to make appointments here. The waiting times are long in my experience. The doctor care is very good.
Andaman Surgery,Efficient,3/30/2023,4,"In for bloods today and as always, they are efficient. Running on time. The appointment only took 3 days from the 'request', which is excellent. The staff are always kind and welcoming"
Andaman Surgery,Everyone lovely,3/30/2023,5,"Me and my family have not had issues here. I get an appointment equally for me and the children when we need one. Everyone you see and speak to, are lovely."
Andaman Surgery,Excellent,11/24/2016,5,The check in machine doesn't work all the time
Andaman Surgery,Excellent care,7/8/2022,4,We have been under the surgery for many years and we have always felt consistently good care. We see various people for different things and that’s been fine.
Andaman Surgery,Excellent overall,5/8/2016,4,I am very happy with the service I receive here. I think they do a almost excellent job with the limits they have.
Andaman Surgery,Excellent service,8/11/2018,5,This service is excellent.  Although sometimes it is a long wait at appointments.  The staff are really good and show they care by how they talk to you.
Andaman Surgery,Excellent surgery,3/30/2023,5,"I have no issues with access to the service. You ring up and they answer in a reasonable amount of time. They try and accommodate you on the same day, and I have needed appointments a few times lately."
Andaman Surgery,Fine with appointment bookings,6/5/2018,4,"Can gain access to  'on the day' appointments fine. It needs more appointments which means I need another GP. I say this as you can be on hold for some time. However, it is good that they tell you where you are in the queue."
Andaman Surgery,Get everything we need,3/29/2023,5,We always get what we need. When we ring in they are prompt and we never have any trouble getting what we need. They are a very supportive surgery.
Andaman Surgery,Good communication,1/30/2018,4,The link up between here and the hospital was good after I was in JPUH for some time. they treat me kindly and respectfully. Sometimes hard to get appointments.
Andaman Surgery,Good service. Won’t put stuff online,4/3/2020,4,"I use computers but I don’t want to use online systems for such personal information. The surgery is not forcing us to, but it may go that way in the future I think."
Andaman Surgery,Got appointment at short notice,8/3/2019,3,"We got appointment at short notice, but it's running more than 30 minutes late.  When we checked in it says 13 minutes behind.  Staff are kind.  However, GP's are better at talking nicely to you than some others."
Andaman Surgery,Great doctor,3/4/2023,5,"I went initially to see the doctor because of acid reflux but whilst I was there the doctor noticed that I had a blood shot eye and he decided to take my blood pressure which was sky high. So I was put on blood pressure tablets, I would never have known this had I not had a face to face appointment, he is a great doctor. I honestly cannot fault them."
Andaman Surgery,Happy with the booking system,6/5/2018,5,Good system whereby I got an appointment today. My partner rang Friday and we were asked to call Monday to get my appointment that week and they got me in right away on the Monday.
Andaman Surgery,Hard to get on the day appointment,10/11/2017,4,"Whilst I find getting an 'on the day' appointment very difficult, my quarterly reviews with my own GP do get booked in advance and I find that very good."
Andaman Surgery,helpful in every way,7/8/2022,5,"I’ve multiple health conditions and so here a lot. They are amazing in how they care. My mother was 3times diagnosed with cancer and they have been so supportive. For example; getting things in place,such as getting an OT round to assess the situation. They are amazing.
I am in weekly for bloods so know staff really well and nothing is too much trouble."
Andaman Surgery,I hope this does not last,9/8/2021,3,"I do not like being palmed off and that is how it feels when you get a call instead of seeing someone. It is true that I did get to see someone, but that was after a few calls.
For the pandemic, this was acceptable, but I really do not want this to last. As a older person I am sure I am not the only one struggling with this."
Andaman Surgery,I use online and works well,9/8/2021,5,"Personally I can use the online system and it works fine for me. I generally get a call in a couple of days, though no time is given, which can be an issue. Even if you call in you won't get a time slot for a call back. I understand this is difficult, but if there was any way to do that, I know it would help some patients. The professional who calls I find is very thorough with questions and I have only had to go in once, the other times things have been sorted over the phone, and it has been fine."
Andaman Surgery,Just takes longer now thats all,9/8/2021,4,"When things had to change due to Covid, the way you get to see someone, just takes longer. It does feel like you are being kept waiting longer to see someone. This surgery does give you the time you need on the telephone though. It feels less rushed than when you used to see the GP or Nurse face to face."
Andaman Surgery,Kind and respectful,1/30/2018,5,I can always get an appointment when I need one and they treat me kindly and respectfully.
Andaman Surgery,Local service is great,6/5/2018,4,I have found the phlebotomy service very good. It is easier to access here at my local surgery.
Andaman Surgery,Long wait on telephone,6/10/2016,4,"When 'phoning' the surgery for anything, whether it be for an appointment, test results or a general inquiry there is usually an enormously long wait before the phone is answered. Once you get an appointment the surgery usually is running on time. The staff do not always have a very good attitude as I am sure they get many patients that are not happy with the waiting on the phone."
Andaman Surgery,Long waiting times,8/11/2018,4,"Sometimes the waiting at appointments can be long.  You do not get told why though, just sit and wait.  Communication would be appreciated."
Andaman Surgery,More Female GP's,6/11/2018,5,It would be helpful if there were more female GP's and if I could book 'longer' appointments more easily as it takes me longer to communicate with.
Andaman Surgery,Much happier here,8/11/2018,5,"I used to be with Bridge road surgery, and since moving here we are so much happier.  Getting appointment is easier and system bit more flexible. Appointments however do run behind most of the time."
Andaman Surgery,Multiple conditions taken care of,11/12/2019,5,"My partner has multiple conditions which we see a multitude of services for, here, at the hospital and in the community. It is good to see that no matter who we see here, they know where we are with things. We don’t have to keep repeating ourselves.

Seen 3 different GP’s and all are thoroughly good. Reception also helpful whenever we need assistance.
Today is advanced appointment where they contacted us for a medication review."
Andaman Surgery,My appointments run late,3/30/2023,3,"I do not come very often, every time I do, even at 8.30 am, my appointment runs late. Today it is more than 30 minutes, and with children it gets difficult. Communicating this somehow to patients would be helpful."
Andaman Surgery,Name appears & goes too fast,4/3/2020,3,"When you get called on the digital board, there is a ‘beep’ then you have to look really quickly as it disappears fast and does not reappear. Need it to stay longer or flash up again. A few patients here today have had the issue of not knowing where to go."
Andaman Surgery,Need to see a certain GP,8/11/2018,3,"My main problem with this surgery it whenever you specifically ask for a certain Doctor on a certain date, you cannot get it.  It has to be another time."
Andaman Surgery,New patient at the surgery,6/10/2016,4,"I have only just moved to this surgery. I had a very pleasant experience having my initial health check up as part of my admission. It is not easy to get an appointment, and can wait up to 3 weeks. When you phone on the day for an appointment the waiting time on the telephone to get to speak to reception is a really long wait. You can end up giving up."
Andaman Surgery,No complaints on the surgery at all,6/5/2018,5,Good communication here. I make appointment and I get a text reminder. Cannot fault the surgery. I moved here from another in the area that I found difficult to get an appointment
Andaman Surgery,No notification for flu jab,8/11/2018,3,My mother who is 87 years old had no notification for a flu jab.  She has COPD and now has to wait until early November.  The nurse did say to me if they have a cancellation when they start their work day they will call my mother.
Andaman Surgery,Not as good as it should be,6/10/2016,3,"Although the premises has good standard of cleanliness, I cannot say the same for the standard of staff. Attitudes are not always as you would expect in a so called 'care' environment. It makes it worse when you have to wait beyond a reasonable amount of time, as it is not easy to then raise that with the staff for fear of a negative response."
Andaman Surgery,Not very child friendly,8/11/2018,4,"The setting out of the waiting room is not pram friendly. So where you can sit is very limited.  This would be true too of wheelchairs.  The children changing table doesn't seem very safe as it looks old fashioned, and just looks grubby. Can get appointments on the day which is very good."
Andaman Surgery,Nurses brilliant,8/11/2018,3,The nursing staff are brilliant.  It is always a problem to get to see a Doctor though.
Andaman Surgery,Online booking works well,3/29/2023,4,I can get through on the phone ok and the online booking also works well. Staff have a good attitude which helps. Car park is too small. The POD online ordering system for prescriptions works well.
Andaman Surgery,Only wish to see certain doctors,8/11/2018,5,Providing I see only certain doctors the treatment is very good.  Some have a bad attitude and so now I won't see them
Andaman Surgery,Pharmacy confusion,1/30/2018,4,"I am always given enough time with the GP to understand what I need. My medication I was prescribed I was told to pick it up at the pharmacy across the road, however there are two next to each other, so I was a little confused. I had forgotten the name that the GP said as I can be forgetful."
Andaman Surgery,Prefer confidentiality with my doctors,8/1/2018,4,Things are not too bad here. Appointments can be difficult to get. I do not like being asked about my health more by reception.
Andaman Surgery,Quick referral,9/8/2021,4,"In the main the surgery has been excellent. Reception from time to time can be brusk, like you are a bother. My particular GP was quick to refer me to the hospital after what was thought to be a reaction to the 2nd Covid vaccination. I am very old school, so finding it hard to adapt to waiting on a 'ringback' but at the same time I understand they don't want people coming in the surgery as much now."
Andaman Surgery,Really thorough,1/30/2018,5,"I have had a chest infection for some time, at one point I was in hospital and have had pneumonia. I am now on my 3rd lot of anti-biotics, but still not well. They are being really thorough at trying to help me get better."
Andaman Surgery,Referred and helped,8/3/2019,4,Have used the surgery moreso in the last year due to medical condition needing attention.  GP referred me to James Paget which happened quite quickly and I was and I am still under 'Urology' team.  They initially thought I had pleurisy.  Had many scans and tests and still checking on this.  So I cannot fault the way they are as the GP ensures they explore everything at the Hospital.  I try to see the same GP for continuity but that is not always possible which has delayed things sometimes.
Andaman Surgery,Runs late most the time,6/11/2018,4,"I usually can get an appointment on the day, but I only call when I am really ill, so it is clear that it is appropriate.
The surgery is always running behind time.  I do think they need to think about the parking arrangements, as it is very limited here."
Andaman Surgery,See my own GP,4/3/2020,4,"For ongoing issues around my health conditions I see my own GP who I think is excellent. For ‘on the day’ issues I will see anyone, which is totally fine and acceptable."
Andaman Surgery,See the GP when you need to,9/8/2021,4,"I am aware of the changes that have happened this year, and it is understandable. Personally, I have seen a GP after a triage call and the appointment is really good. I would not wish to use the online system myself so I am fine with waiting for a ring back, but I do not really go anywhere so can wait for it."
Andaman Surgery,Seen really promptly,9/8/2021,5,"When we were concerned about our child, they got us in on that day and it put our mind at rest. I would have had to have gone to A&E if they had not seen us that day, so I am thankful for that. We had rang them, as felt it was urgent, otherwise we tend to use the online system.  It is good that they have both options."
Andaman Surgery,Seldom same GP,1/27/2019,4,It is frustrating to have to explain symptoms to a different doctor each visit.
Andaman Surgery,So far so good,11/12/2019,4,"Only just moved in to the area but all good so far. They saw my son before we had officially registered, which was good as it reassured me about what he had as I would have worried and probably ended up going to A&E if we couldn’t be seen."
Andaman Surgery,"Some positives, some negatives",6/11/2018,3,"Sometimes the staff can be impatient with you on the telephone.  There are long waits especially when you are due to see the Nurse Practitioner.  More of an explanation of illness would be good too.
It is easy to get an appointment, however recall for Long term Conditions is very poor."
Andaman Surgery,Surgery is very accommodating,6/5/2018,4,I can get an appointment most of the time. They are really good helping me with my poor mental health.
Andaman Surgery,Switching surgery benefited me,6/5/2018,5,"Have found it so much easier to come to this surgery for blood tests, than going to Kirkley Mill. The parking there was very difficult."
Andaman Surgery,thankfully I do not need to go often,6/10/2016,5,"As I do not need to attend the surgery very often I can only reflect on my own observations with the minimal amount of useage I have had of the service. It is difficult to get an appointment, like it is at most surgeries, so I am glad I do not need the service very often. The premises is clean, and I would expect no less. My doctor is very good. If I had any issues I would confront them to their faces, but as yet that has not happened.
Not sure what can be done about the appointments issue."
Andaman Surgery,There when I need them,9/8/2021,4,"I do not use the surgery very often, but when ever I have needed to, they are really good. I generally use the online system and get a call within 2 days. I have only once not see the right person, but they got me in a couple of days later again. I was more frustrated for them! I think the online system works, but when you do not know what they need to know, you may not always submit everything they need to know to send you to the right person. I had a call based on my submission and not asked much else, which is where it may have fallen down."
Andaman Surgery,Timing is awful,8/1/2018,3,Things do not run on time most of the time. Staff are lovely and caring once you see them.
Andaman Surgery,Very caring,7/8/2022,5,The surgery is very caring. Recently my husband passed away and they were so good looking after my well-being too. As his Carer it was good that I was given a different GP as it helps when you need to talk about what is wrong with yourself to not keep getting asked about the other person.
Andaman Surgery,Very good,1/30/2018,5,I have been coming here for many years and I have always found it to be very good.
Andaman Surgery,Very good practice,7/8/2022,4,I have found the practice good to me. I’ve seen people more face to face recently which was needed to help check my balance after a fall and previous stroke.
Andaman Surgery,Very happy with care and treatment received,3/29/2018,5,GP was great and referred me appropriately to right services. Two heart operations over the years. 1.) 2004 Papworth Aorto valve replacement; 2.) Basaldon Mitral valve repair. Both very good treatment.
Andaman Surgery,Very happy with service,6/11/2018,5,"I am happy with the service I have received here.  Today they are running 30-40 minutes late. It has become the 'norm' though, so you just get used to it if you want to see someone."
Andaman Surgery,Very impressed with locum,1/30/2023,5,"Came in and saw a locum Dr.
Wasn't sure about what was given, but then brought my son to him the following week and he was really good and thorough. 
I then had to come back after having gone to an out of hrs Dr who was less than ""okay"". 
The Dr explained everything with side effects that the out hrs Dr had prescribed me, despite the fact he misdiagnosed me resulting in putting me on something I shouldn't of been on due to my size/build, (I'm the size of a teenager and not even 6st).
The Dr not only explained everything, he did a thorough check and sent samples to lab and referred me to hospital.
Since then I've developed a condition due to this medication from out of hrs Dr.
I wish the Dr was a permanent fixture at my surgery as he is very informative, kind and reassuring."
Andaman Surgery,Very pleased,8/11/2018,5,"We have been pleased with the surgery since moving here recently.  We can get appointments easily, although they do generally run behind"
Andaman Surgery,Waiting times too long,8/11/2018,5,"The reception staff sometimes come across like patients are a nuisance, and appointment times almost always run over leaving longer waiting times."
Andaman Surgery,Walking in works for me,4/3/2020,4,"I’ve not used the online system yet,but  I barely ever use this service, so when I do I walk in to ask for an appointment and generally speaking I get one."
Andaman Surgery,Would not send my urgent records.,10/28/2020,1,"Asked for a copy of my records for another GP. They could not email or post, only collection available. 
I am overseas."
Angel Hill,3 star,9/16/2015,3,3 star
Angel Hill,4 star,5/8/2015,4,Overall surgery is good
Angel Hill,A bit more tact needed,12/18/2019,4,"A bit more tact from the reception staff at times needed when talking to patients about private issues, if I want to see the same doctor I would have to book ahead about 2-3 weeks. Its not a bad surgery though."
Angel Hill,A good surgery,7/3/2019,4,"You can usually get an appointment on the day, this is a good surgery, no concerns.
I'm not too keen on waiting so long on the phone to speak to the receptionist to make an appointment."
Angel Hill,A great surgery,6/28/2022,5,"Mum is at this surgery and they are really great with her. I have no issues getting her appointments when she needs them, I really can't fault anything they do."
Angel Hill,A very good surgery,7/3/2019,4,"Waiting at the appointment can be challenging sometimes. Can end up calling lot of times at 8am only to find sometimes that you can't get an appointment on the day. 
They could be more considerate if small children are with the patient as to where in the surgery they are placed. But otherwise this is a very good surgery."
Angel Hill,Always good,2/27/2019,4,"My experience at this surgery has always been good, particularly around prescriptions/medications"
Angel Hill,Always good for appointments,9/13/2022,5,I'm happy to see any of the GPs. I have had an issue with a prescription item not being available from my normal pharmacy but the staff here have been very helpful and sorted it out very quickly for me so that I can pick up the item from a different pharmacy.  I've been at this surgery for years and its always been first class and accommodating.
Angel Hill,Always helpful,5/13/2022,5,"The staff at the surgery are always helpful and the care is really great, I can't fault them. The triage process works well for me but for others it doesn't always suit them and isn't so great."
Angel Hill,Always helpful.,4/21/2021,5,"Telephone appointments work really well, a face to face will be arranged if required. COVID protocols reassuring. Staff always happy to help."
Angel Hill,Apology given for poor service,7/3/2019,2,Over the year I have had cause to make a formal complaint regarding the care given to my child. A medication issues and poor diagnosis. I have subsequently had a letter of apology from the surgery about one of the issues.
Angel Hill,Appointments,3/23/2016,3,An ever increasing problem using the surgery is that it is very hard to get an appointment a lot of the time.
Angel Hill,Appointments are available,7/13/2023,5,Appointments have been booked for me when I've called and it's even been with my GP too.  If I can and they are available I will always try to see them as I like that they understand and know me and my condition. It can be frustrating when you have to wait on the phone to get through but appointments are available when you do.
Angel Hill,Appointments system has improved,7/3/2019,5,"A positive referral was made to the hospital by this surgery. However a couple of the doctors do seem to lack a bit of empathy for patients. 
The telephone system has improved, being on hold is better than ringing lots of times. 
The appointments system has improved."
Angel Hill,"As always, very polite and efficient.",11/23/2020,5,I have been a patient at the surgery for many years and have always had a good experience.
Angel Hill,Blood Tests,3/23/2016,4,Blood tests are done in the surgery - very useful and convenient.
Angel Hill,Brilliant,6/1/2023,5,"Never had a problem here. The staff are polite and helpful and I see a really lovely and fantastic doctor. I've been very well supported with my young baby and we've been able to get a range of appointments depending on what it was. The Flu clinics were amazingly well run and organised and I really like the text message reminders for appointments, it all works really well from my perspective."
Angel Hill,Brilliant,9/13/2022,5,"Never had an issue, I really like the triage process so you can talk to a GP and are only called in when needed. I don't feel anything at the surgery needs to change as I'm happy to see any of the doctors and like having the email and text message reminders, it's really helpful.  I like seeing the nurses as they have time for you and are very thorough."
Angel Hill,Can get appointments in reasonable time,12/18/2019,4,"I am quite happy at this surgery, I am able to get appointments as needed in a reasonable time period. No issues."
Angel Hill,Care and support provided,6/1/2023,4,Appointments are ok to get. Generally its all good and although I see a different GP it works well and they are lovely so I'm not worried about that. With the additional measures introduced since covid it does now feel less personal and like there are barriers at times to being seen althought that does seem to be easing now. Some staff could be a little more friendly and approachable as you sort of expect a health setting to be a bit more human but I have received the care and support I've needed so not much needs to change.
Angel Hill,Care is good,9/27/2022,4,The care at the surgery is good and I'm quite happy with the doctors and nurses although I would prefer better continuity which isn't always available.  Parking is an issue as you can't just drop samples off or pick medication up but I doubt there is much that the surgery can do about it.  I've tried to cancel an inhaler off my prescription a number of times but it keeps reappearing and being dispensed.
Angel Hill,Caring and always happy to help,2/5/2020,5,Needed to speak to GP. Receptionist very helpful and accommodating. GP rang back promptly giving excellent advice and care. Followed up on actions as promised. Very satisfied with every aspect of my care at Angel Hill surgery. Times are difficult for all but staff still giving reassuring advice and support. Thank you
Angel Hill,Cleanliness,9/24/2018,4,Many aspects of this surgery are fine but cleanliness! When I look up I see lots of cobwebs (in waiting area) and dirty light fittings. Striplights- you can see dead bugs laying in them right in the middle of the waiting area.
Angel Hill,Consistently good over the years,12/18/2019,4,"I find the staff to be kind and helpful here, I am always able to book an appointment when I need one, I have found them to be consistently good over the years."
Angel Hill,Covid 19 vaccination,2/15/2021,5,"Had first vaccination on Saturday, following a text invitation a few days earlier.  Very well organised, couldn’t have been easier for my wife and I, with appointments just one minute apart.  Many thanks to all concerned"
Angel Hill,Delays being seen,9/13/2022,4,I spoke to a doctor the other day and they said can you get down here. When I said yes I expected an appointment that day but instead I was given one for a few days later. I'm not very clear why it's taken so long to get seen.  Care is normally good.
Angel Hill,Diagnosis,9/14/2022,2,"Had a 5 minute face to face appointment but I feel that a diagnosis for a shoulder issue was jumped to and now that it has got worse I've been told to take medication and do exercises but I decided to go to A&E to get it looked at properly.  The appointment was so rushed, no time was spent and it would be better if I'd been listened to."
Angel Hill,Difficult getting through on phone,6/1/2023,3,"The biggest issue is getting through on the phone, it was ok today as it only took 20 mins. I've had an urgent appointment today and my daughter called for me as when I called I was told I would need to wait a week to see a specific doctor but I've happily seen someone different today which has been great.  I've only had to wait about 15 mins for the medication I've been prescribed."
Angel Hill,dismayed at the level of service,9/11/2020,1,"Have had some truly awful  experience from not so angelic Angel Hill Practice. Little or no help with pain. Had to resort to contacting NHS England to force them to help me resulting in total hip replacement. Even the surgeon commented how bad it was.
 However, the diabetic service is really good, it is the only reason to remain with this practice"
Angel Hill,Doctor's appointment.,11/21/2016,5,Recently moved to the area. Needed an appointment before I had registered with doctor's surgery. Was given same day appointment and immediate registration. Prompt and considerate service from the GP.
Angel Hill,dp - excellent,7/15/2016,5,"I have never been refused an appointment same day when I have said I needed one and call before 8.30  Sometimes have to wait as GP gives time to each patient.  Always polite, helpful"
Angel Hill,Dr didn't explain things,6/7/2016,3,The Dr didn't explain things and didn't give me antibiotics. He said 'Drs are really scrutinised about antibiotics at the moment'. Which didn't help me as I was really ill.
Angel Hill,Efficient and caring,1/4/2015,4,"Advance appointments and repeat presciptions are easily accessed on line, however I've not recently used the urgent appointment system.  GP's are usually prompt and williing to listen to all concerns.  New system of reviewing people within LTC clinics, instead of GP each time, should improve efficiency.  Pharmacy is efficient."
Angel Hill,Excellent but long waiting time,2/21/2017,5,Getting appointment online easy but not on phone.  Once there you are waiting for appointment as not in on time
Angel Hill,Excellent Care,12/28/2019,5,"Bearing in mind what pressure the NHS is under I have received excellent care during the past year from the the receptionists, pharmacy staff and nurses and especially from the doctors. Good listening skills and efficient referrals when needed. I am so appreciative to have such a good GP practice. Thank You!"
Angel Hill,Excellent Quick response,11/10/2016,5,"I called Angel hill after my daughter who had been poorly with fever, sore throat ect developed a rash at 4.45 on a Monday evening. Me and husband disagreed on wether it was disappearing or not.

I called Angel hill spoke to a friendly receptionist and explained I believed I may be wasting there time but concerned about meningitis trying to avoid a whole evening in a and e could a doctor check her - she was seen by a doctor at 5.20, no meningitis but she did have tonsillitis so was glad we managed to see a dr"
Angel Hill,Excellent service.,10/11/2021,5,After contacting the surgery I was phoned by the GP within 10mins and given an appt for the same morning. Felt listened to and received prompt treatment and explanations and a planned follow up appt.
Angel Hill,Excellent surgery,7/4/2021,5,Always helpful. Useful to have email and phone options to contact them. Very quick to get back to you and follow up. Very kind and helpful staff. Really excellent surgery
Angel Hill,"Excellent, Supportive, Caring Team",1/12/2021,5,"We receive excellent advice, support and treatment from everyone at this Practice. The staff are kind, caring and professional. They are obliging, and listen to what we say and do not assume they know. Our Flu vaccinations were dealt with quickly and efficiently. Our Covid vaccinations and Booster were dealt with at a central centre but we were informed by the practice what to do and when."
Angel Hill,fair,6/21/2016,3,I do not use the surgery often but when I do the care is good.  They just need to get the appointments system sorted.
Angel Hill,Frustrated by phone answering service,9/2/2021,1,"Invited by text to make appointment for covid vaccine on main number, 01284 753008. Phone system appeared to have gone into meltdown, presumably due to volume of calls.  Callback service doesn’t seem to work. Feel sorry for anyone who needs to contact the surgery urgently.  Why not reduce the number of calls by enabling appointments to be made by email or on line as well as by phone? Also feel sorry for receptionists, whose life could be made easier and more efficient by using a better system"
Angel Hill,Frustrating appointment system,7/3/2019,3,"Waiting on the phone for an appointment is frustrating, but otherwise a very good surgery."
Angel Hill,Good,6/1/2023,4,"The wait on the phone was quite long today, it was about 40 minutes but when I got through I was given an appointment with a doctor straight away by the receptionist and didn't have to wait for a call back which was much easier.  The staff have always been great whenever our young daughter has needed to be seen and overall I'm happy with everything at the moment.  The only thing I haven't liked was being asked by a doctor when I brought in my baby whether she was my first. I find this can be condesending and implies you don't know what you are doing as a mother. The fact I know my baby well and I'm concerned should be more the point rather than trying to find out how many other children I've had and suggesting I'm worrying about nothing."
Angel Hill,Good,7/3/2019,5,"I was dealt with well following a cancer diagnosis, I was referred to hospital and am now thankfully clear. I might try the ring back next time to make an appointment as you can wait a while in the queue on the phone."
Angel Hill,Good but don't like ansaphone,11/17/2016,4,Do not like answerphone you need to use before talking to receptionist.  The inital voice is welcoming but the last voice is not !
Angel Hill,Good care but 17mins hold on the phone!!,2/15/2018,4,"Excellent care when I eventually got through at 1pm ish on a week day. Doctor called back and gave my daughter an appointment that afternoon. 

I don’t think 17mins on hols being told your the first in the que is very good tho with a sick toodler and baby to look after. Receptionist just told me she was busy."
Angel Hill,Good in parts,4/10/2015,3,Good in parts and not so good in others.
Angel Hill,Good quick communication,12/18/2019,4,"Good quick service, good communication and they do listen well. I recently had to have some holiday inoculations and I was handled very well, they are just very accommodating to me, I was even given permission to scan documents and send them in to the surgery to return them.  I have an eye condition and they gave me an excellent referral when needed. I have found GP appointment to be running on time but the nurse appointments can be a little more off schedule."
Angel Hill,Good service,4/9/2015,5,I am well looked after here. Quicker appointments would be better though
Angel Hill,Good work,4/2/2019,5,"Angel Hill surgery looks after me very well, I have been registered there all of my life. I Am well satisfied and I can't think why I would ever want to change. They picked up on a change in my heart condition and that is how I come to be in the care of the Cardiac Unit. Good work!!"
Angel Hill,GP was lovely,7/25/2018,4,I got an appointment straight away but I waited 20 minutes after my appointment time. When I got to see them the GP was lovely and explained everything to me.
Angel Hill,Great caring team,7/13/2019,5,All the staff and doctors have always provided great care. Thank you.
Angel Hill,Great service,7/13/2023,4,"Its easy to arrange mum's appointments and today we got one really quickly. We've been able to get blood tests at the surgery and even when needed by the district nurses at home, which is far easier."
Angel Hill,Happy with staff,7/10/2023,5,"I called this morning and then spoke to a doctor who then gave me an appointment to come in to see them.  I've found that it works well when you need an appointment and I'm really happy with staff, they're great."
Angel Hill,Have been unable to book appt. since pre-Xmas,1/17/2020,1,"Multiple contradictory explanations given - Person who books spots.appts. unavailable, phone next week when appt. slots will be available, changing booking system so need to phone on the day. Poor planning and appalling patient service."
Angel Hill,Helpful attitude towards me,7/3/2019,5,"I am very happy with this surgery. I never need to complain or be concerned.
They have a very helpful attitude towards me.
I have no issues with  waiting at appointments.
I am more than happy with them here.
I Would like to see a little more consideration of which patients they send upstairs, as stairs are very steep."
Angel Hill,Helpful staff,12/18/2019,5,Helpful staff and medical team. I cannot always get an appointment when I want one but I was impressed today as I managed to ring up and get on on the morning. I do wish there was more blue badge parking outside.
Angel Hill,I am more than happy with this surgery,7/3/2019,5,"This surgery has been very good to me personally and any problems have been sorted out.
I am more than happy with this surgery"
Angel Hill,"I receive an efficient, professional service",5/9/2021,5,"On all occasions my GP has given excellent patient care. She listens carefully, discusses her proposed treatment, and leaves me confident that I am receiving excellent care. I write a summary of my condition and medication so that she can scan it in to my notes. She always follows up."
Angel Hill,Impressed !,12/18/2019,4,Waiting time is very short to be called into the surgery which is good when you have two small children. I am actually very impressed with this surgery.
Angel Hill,Improved,7/10/2023,4,I feel it has improved as it is easier to get appointments than it used to be.  Surgery staff know you so it's easier when they understand what is going on. I do find that econsult asks a lot of questions which can be repetitive but I've had good quick replies from a GP and I still find it easier than calling.  For some reason on the NHS App I haven't been able to order medication before 7 days which is fine in most circumstances but there is no option to put a note on to say why you need medication early when you are going away.  The staff are good and after speaking to a GP on the phone I was asked to come down to the surgery.  I've also had fairly good continuity with staff and can always ask to see someone specific.  There has been a message on the phone line to say that there are no appointments available but when I've spoken to someone I've been squeezed in.
Angel Hill,It is and always has been second to none.,2/17/2022,5,The one to one care I receive from my Dr. is fantastic nothing is ever to much trouble for her and the fantastic team at Angel Hill surgery
Angel Hill,It is very difficult to get an appointment.,9/5/2018,3,It is very difficult to get an appointment and the last one I had (with diabetes nurse) was cancelled so I didn't get to go
Angel Hill,"Kind, Caring Vaccination Nurses",12/2/2018,5,"Ok Ill admit I hate needles and doctors so taking my baby to be vaccinated was a bit traumatic especially with a toddler in tow. The nurses were very kind and just got on with it rather than drawing it out.
Nowhere near my favourite experience but the nurses made it as easy as it could be!"
Angel Hill,Long term patient,5/18/2022,5,My mother has been a long term patient of Angel Hill Surgery and has always been very impressed with the service that they provide. She currently sees Dr who is simply wonderful. Dr always has time to listen to any issues my mother is having and is so kind and helpful. Knowing that my mother is under Dr's care is such a comfort to me as I know that she really cares and looks after my mother so well.
Angel Hill,Lovely surgery,7/10/2023,5,"Nurses are very nice, I see them weekly and they are great and explain things very well. My appointments are booked by them following visits so that I know when I'm coming in and can plan ahead.  It would be nice if I see a doctor more easily but the nurses liaise with the doctors when needed anyway so it's not overly necessary."
Angel Hill,Medical staff are excellent,12/18/2019,5,"Very friendly atmosphere here, I have never had any issues. I am very impressed with the medical staff. On line works very well for making appointments. I have been here more often this last year and they have been very good to me."
Angel Hill,My GP excellent,10/14/2015,5,"My GP (Name removed) is excellent - always willing to listen. Recently saw (Name removed) - brisk, efficient, knowledgeable"
Angel Hill,Needed a call back from a dr,2/18/2022,5,The young man who took my call was so helpful and obliging . A pleasure and an asset to the surgery x
Angel Hill,No continuity of care,5/13/2021,1,Triage calls only. Wait over 3 hours for a call. Never know which Doctor will call and every one tells you something different about your diagnosis/treatment.
Angel Hill,No issues,6/1/2023,5,"I've had no problems getting appointments however most of mine are pre booked by the nurse after each visit. The nurse has been incredible and the GP I tend to see has been so supportive, I've been so well treated and the care has been amazing, all the staff are great.  Mental health support and care has also been very good. The phones are the only small problem, it can take a while to get through."
Angel Hill,Not always easy to get an appointment,12/18/2019,4,It is not always easy to get an appointment when you ring up but once you can get one the surgery is fantastic.
Angel Hill,Not being called in is great,5/10/2021,4,Appointments are available when needed and not being called in for everything is great. Any issues get sorted really quickly and easily and the friendly staff make all the difference.
Angel Hill,Not the same as it was,7/10/2023,3,I don't feel that it is the same as it used to be as it is harder to get face to face appointments and house calls as most issues are addressed on the phone. but the care provided is fantastic. The dispensary staff are so lovely and will sort any issues out but there are occassional issues with medications and they are very busy.   I had been told that ear syringing is no longer done at the surgery but I've been there when other patients have been having their ears done so there seem to be differing messages.
Angel Hill,Nurses are excellent,7/3/2019,4,"Getting through on the phone is difficult, but face to face is easier. 
I try to get the same doctor each time, and the nurses are excellent.
I would be sad if this surgery closed."
Angel Hill,Ok,4/9/2015,3,Ok
Angel Hill,On the whole happy,7/3/2019,4,"Appointment making can be a little challenging
On the whole I am quite happy with this surgery"
Angel Hill,Online appointment system works well,7/3/2019,4,"I use the online appointment booking system and it suits me very well.
Parking at this surgery can be a challenge.
In the past, the GPs have given personal touches to their care and support (the GP sent a letter and phone call of condolence when a family member passed away)."
Angel Hill,Online booking system is good,7/3/2019,5,"I have always been able to get an appointment on the day. Front desk are very helpful.
It would be better to have the consistency of seeing the same GP, but the online booking system is good."
Angel Hill,Parking,3/23/2016,1,Parking is a problem here
Angel Hill,Pharmacy don't always have all medications in,12/18/2019,4,"Good surgery overall. Patient access is excellent for appointments on line and also for repeat prescriptions, not such good service if you have to contact them by phone. Often some of the tablets are difficult for the pharmacy to acquire, this means that I sometimes have to make a second journey for my wife's medications which can be inconvenient when you live out town rurally."
Angel Hill,Pleased with the surgery,7/3/2019,5,"Any queries are dealt with sympathetically and with care.
I can book online (Patient access) which works very well for me. I can book ahead or on the day and order medications online.
I am very pleased with this surgery and the consistency of GP care."
Angel Hill,"Poor mental health care, lack of empathy",11/25/2019,1,"Mental health first aid/training/awareness needed URGENTLY. Staff attitude of nurses is caring, kind and understanding. However on separate occasions with separate GPs I have had a bad experience. On one experience I was mocked when explaining my struggles with mental health. On another experience, after being discharged from the mental health community team, I was treated unkindly by a GP who had little consideration for my situation/mental well-being when conducting a routine medication review."
Angel Hill,positive experience with health assistant,11/30/2020,5,"Health assistant was fantastic, great improvement on previous experience. Friendly, professional and efficient. Really can't praise them highly enough.
Their attitude was a breath of fresh air."
Angel Hill,Professional and efficient in trying times,9/4/2020,5,My daughter was unwell with an asthma symptoms. We were triaged quickly by both the receptionist and on-call GP and given a face to face appointment with a GP within an hour. Thank you to all involved and best wishes in current situation
Angel Hill,Put process above patient care.,6/3/2019,1,"GP seems to change with every call resulting in incorrect advice and worse, prescriptions that are wrong. Forever going over old ground and repeating same mistakes. Receptionists seem to really enjoy saying ""the computer says no"". A practice lacking any morale compass."
Angel Hill,Quite happy with surgery,7/3/2019,4,"Quite happy with the surgery to date. Often waiting at an appointment to go in. 
Did have one situation of a misdiagnosis a while ago."
Angel Hill,Quite happy with the surgery,7/3/2019,4,"There is a call back system in place now which is much better to get an appointment. This has improved over recent months.
Can be up to 45 minutes waiting before you go in to see the GP.
I am quite happy with how the surgery is at this time."
Angel Hill,Quite happy with the surgery overall,7/3/2019,4,"A bit of a wait on the phone to get through but can usually get an appointment.
10-15 minute wait at the appointment time to be seen but that's not to bad.
Quite happy with the surgery overall."
Angel Hill,"Really good, very helpful",9/13/2022,5,"Really good, access has been great. I called this morning with a high blood pressure reading and they've been very thorough. I like that I can see a summary of my notes on the system and staff are great, very understanding and I feel I can ask anything, they are always great."
Angel Hill,So helpful and caring.,6/11/2019,5,"Really helpful reception staff.  Pharmacy staff are always pleasant and helpful. I have been a patient since 1981.  I have always found the doctors to be exceptional. They are very thorough, understanding and patient.  Thank you all."
Angel Hill,Spot on,7/13/2023,5,"I've had no problems getting appointments, I've called and spoken to reception and been able to get appointments straight away.  I'm also happy to come down to the surgery to arrange appointments. I'm not always able to see my own GP as easily but have always been invited in when needed following a telephone consultation.  I do like to try and see my own GP if possible but if the issue is urgent I'd happily see any of the GPs as they are all great."
Angel Hill,Staff great,9/13/2022,5,"A very good surgery. I have regular appointments and the staff are always great, always feel well looked after. Good reception staff who are friendly and helpful. The only issue is that the dispensary door really bangs each time someone goes in or out, it would be nice if that could be softened."
Angel Hill,Staff very good,6/1/2023,4,"My appointment today was booked weeks ago as it is with the nurse. I called this week for something and was 12th in the queue and it took about 20 minutes to get through but that's not always the case. I've had no issues getting my prescriptions when they are needed and the staff are very good, friendly and helpful. I think they are doing a great job."
Angel Hill,Super friendly,7/13/2023,4,"Love the surgery, it's super friendly. I've been very well supported by the surgery and have been very pleased with the care provided. The children have been seen really quickly when needed too.  I have been given appointments upstairs in the past which can be really difficult with a young child and a baby."
Angel Hill,They do really well,6/8/2016,5,"I can have an in depth and open discussion with any of the GPs, they do really well."
Angel Hill,They know me well,9/13/2022,5,"I feel staff know me well which is great and I find staff very helpful and will sort anything out. Parking is an issue especially if you are just dropping samples off.  Have been very happy with the learning disability reviews that have been done, they've always been good."
Angel Hill,"Treatment is good, but wait isn't",7/3/2019,4,"We had a positive referral to Addenbrookes. Waiting to get an appointment is a challenge, but 1st class treatment is given at this surgery"
Angel Hill,"Triage as too many questions, GP time short",7/3/2019,4,"You are able to get an appointment when you want it on the day.
I don't always like the front desk to ask too many questions, and the GP doesn't always give as much time as I would like."
Angel Hill,Triage works well,9/13/2022,5,"The triage process has worked well. I called first thing, spoke to triage doctor quickly and they arranged for me to come in to the surgery. It appears things are starting to ease a little when trying to get appointments, it must be very difficult for them. Staff are very good, very happy to see any of them."
Angel Hill,Unable to prebook appointment,10/22/2019,3,Told all bookable appointments gone and offered an appointment for 3 weeks later..Awkward having to ring early on the day then find appointments already full....difficult for working people....having to wait for GP to ring back is also inconvenient....all very stressful
Angel Hill,Very busy phones,6/1/2023,5,"The phones are very busy and it takes time to get through. I spoke to a doctor this morning and was then invited in to see a doctor within a short space of time. In the past it has felt like they would rather just give me different medication rather than actually seeing me, almost to delay being seen.  The conversations I've had with the doctors though have been good and I do actually feel well listened to and able to ask questions.  The surgery does appear to be very quiet when you actually visit, the waiting rooms are very empty."
Angel Hill,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"Phones have a great call back option when you're waiting which I really like. I can get appointments to see a GP whenever I need one and I called this morning, spoke to a doctor and have then been invited in for an appointment which is great. It seems a well run and organised surgery with nice, kind and helpful staff. The only slight issue is the parking availability but there is nothing the surgery can do about it when its a public car park."
Angel Hill,Very good,12/18/2019,5,"I don't come here often thankfully but when I do it is very good, no concerns from me at all, I am able to get an appointment."
Angel Hill,Very good advise here,12/18/2019,5,I always have been given very good advise here by the medical practitioner. I find it easy to make appointments when needed. Doctors are excellent always very clear with their explanations.
Angel Hill,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"All working well for me at this surgery
no issues at all
It's very good."
Angel Hill,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,At 8am the waiting to get through on the phone is challenging. But getting an appointment is usually OK on the day. Very good surgery otherwise.
Angel Hill,Very happy with the surgery,7/3/2019,5,"No concerns at all, more than happy with this surgery."
Angel Hill,"Very happy, nothing to change",7/3/2019,4,"Very happy with the surgery, nothing should be changed"
Angel Hill,Very satisfied,11/11/2021,5,"I'm very satisfied with the surgery. In the past the paramedic has been out on a home visit which was great, sorting the issues quickly. They also deliver my medication monthly which is a real help."
Angel Hill,Very understanding Doctors,12/18/2019,5,"The doctors are very understanding. I always seem to be able to get an appointment when I need one, if they can't happen to get me in on the day they can ask the GP to call me back so at least I get to speak to a medical professional. The telephone call waiting system has definitely improved it now tells you where you are in the queue which is much better that hearing the engaged tone."
Angel Hill,Visit to local dr,7/11/2016,3,Visited to local dr as my gp was on leave. I was pregnant with bipolar on medication (as previous pregnancy) obvious dr didn't really know what to do in this situation.
Angel Hill,We are so lucky,7/5/2021,5,"I have been fortunate enough not to have needed to contact the surgery for myself, but members of my immediate family have needed to seek help and the service has been outstanding.  The reception staff are courteous and helpful, a GP has phoned back from promptly and if needed they have been seen in the surgery the same day.  Angel Hill Surgery is superb and I am so grateful that we are on their patient list."
Angel Hill,We only seem to be able to have telephone app,2/12/2020,5,"Dr very good wrote to consultant because it had been over a year since I was seen by the pain consultant, and this had knock on effects to my mental heath. Doctor wrote to the spinal consultant who admitted i had been overlooked.  His course of action was to phone me and by the end of November I should receive an appointment to see him.  None of that has happened.  I am more or less confined to a wheelchair making life for myself and husband, who has heart problems, very difficult.  I have been fitted with an internal device, which from my point of view should be regularly monitor.  Annually I would think would be adequate.  I had a nasty fall not too long ago and I wasn’t sure if it had dislodged the implant.  I tried for more than a month to contact the specialist nurse, left messages on the phone but never had any return calls. I do not think this is any kind of service.  When I was seeing the spinal surgeon I neve r had any problems at all but after a time he had to refer me to the pain consultant. Which I have found totally different to when I was seeing the surgeon. The pain got so bad that I made an appointment with a person who did lots of acupuncture, massaging, strapping the whole of my right leg.  I did benefit from this treatment but it got so expensive that I had to limit the treatment.  I am 83 and always be en a very active person now I am more or less trapped in 4 walls.  When I had the last operation the occupational therapist came to assess our home and she arranged to have a grab rail put into the bathroom and another one close to our bed which have been very helpful.  I mentioned to her that I could not get out of the front door or the back door that leads into the garden, she said to leave it to her and she would arrange something. That was well over 2 years ago and nothing has been done.  The only way I can get fresh air is to sit with the patio doors open, but it is too cold to do that now.  I want to try to stay as independent as I can but not  being able to get out of the bungalow is so frustrating.  My husband is also my career and to start with he would almost carry me out of the front door,  Since his heart problems started he has been told he on no account was to lift me about, very understandable. At one stage the mental health nurse became involved with this, and I was told that shortly something would be done.  At the moment I am in limbo and a lot of pain.  My life has completely changed since my spinal problems started."
Angel Hill,Well supported,7/10/2023,5,I've been well supported by my GP and they've even visited at home which has been very good.
Angel Hill,Went above and beyond,7/24/2021,5,"We (family of 4) have been patients at Angel Hill for several years. They are a large practice, so yes you may not see the same Dr but you will always get an appointment (whether face to face or in surgery) and the Dr's have always be fantastic. 

Yesterday I urgently needed a prescription organised. The dispensary were fab, as was the Dr. Within a couple of hours they had organised everything for me."
Angel Hill,Worked well,9/13/2022,5,The system in place to get appointments works well and I'm seeing a nurse which is the appropriate person to see for the issue. They could be a little quicker at getting medications ready as there are queues at times.
Angel Hill,Wrong tablets,10/17/2019,4,"Despite requesting a particular brand of tablets online and which have been agreed. by my doctor I have, on at least three times, been sent by taxi the wrong tablets. This is annoying as I highlight this in the comments to the dispensary."
Beccles,3 weeks for an appointment.,2/21/2017,5,3 weeks for an appointment.
Beccles,A bit easier this week,8/18/2022,4,"There are long waits on the phone in the mornings but this week has been easier and I was only 4th in the queue. I've had a problem all week and don't think the medication is working so I called the surgery again, spoke to a doctor and they have arrnaged for me to come in, so it's all worked well."
Beccles,A bit frustrating,11/26/2021,3,Getting an appointment is difficult. I've had a phone consultation for children but feel that they haven't addressed the issues and we've needed to have further contact with the surgery. For me personally I'm completely happy with having a phone appointment and the care provided is good when you do get to see someone. It's just for the children that I feel its not always appropriate.
Beccles,A good surgery,11/26/2021,4,The surgery is good it's just a shame that I'm unable to get my ears syringed by the surgery any more but staff have explained the situation and I've been told where to go to get it done.
Beccles,Abusive,12/30/2020,1,Dr was abusive don't listen and don't explain. I can only describe the behaviour of the GP as bullying
Beccles,All very friendly,4/5/2018,5,I called at 8.00 this morning for an appointment for my young daughter and we are being seen the same morning! All the staff are friendly and explain things very well.
Beccles,All very good,8/17/2018,4,"I have been a patient for four years. All is very good apart from delay in being called in to appointment. Also, it can be hard to hear when your name is called when the waiting room is full (and noisy)."
Beccles,Appointment issues,6/10/2015,2,Can't get an appointment when needed.
Beccles,Appointment process is drawn out,8/18/2022,4,The process to get an appointment does seem unnecessarily drawn out now as you can't just call up and book an appointment.  I've felt brushed off by a doctor who made it clear that they were the one to diagnose even though I was suggesting it was a reoccurence of an issue. I also feel that notes from the hospital are not always well read by GPs and it has resulted in the wrong medication being prescribed. The nurses though are great and I see them regularly.
Beccles,Appointment system specific and sometimes long waits.,2/21/2017,4,You have to ring dead on 8 am and keep trying.If you miss that it starts again at 2 pm.  Oncw through I have always got an appointment on the day.  Routine appointment could be 3 weeks
Beccles,Approachable and good leadership,1/14/2021,3,A few issues to begin with but after speaking with the practice manager my mind was at ease . I have since recieved great treatment and found this practice does have great leadership and they will listen to your concerns
Beccles,Been very good,8/18/2022,5,"I feel they are coping very well under the circumstances. I can phone the surgery and get a call back, speak to the doctor and they then call me in to the surgery if needed. They've never let me down and I've had lots of issues and they've always been great, staff are always so nice. Getting appointments to see the nurse is always fine to do."
Beccles,better than it has been,11/4/2022,4,I feel that they have managed well throughout covid but it does seem easier now to get a face to face appointment with a doctor than it was. The triage system works ok but phones aren't easy for mum and she misses things that are said.
Beccles,Better these last few years,8/24/2018,4,It is so much better these last few years (than used to be the case). I can still be a little bit late being called in but nurses and doctors are all very professional and understanding
Beccles,Brilliant,8/25/2019,5,"They have been absolutely brilliant to me, they helped me so much several months ago when my mother in law had dementia. I would never have managed without their support."
Beccles,Brilliant Practice but delays to see female GP,3/13/2017,5,"There can be quite a delay if, for example, I need to see a lady doctor. Overall they are a brilliant practice"
Beccles,Brilliant with me,8/17/2018,4,The surgery have been brilliant with me and they were also brilliant with my late husband. Clinicians and reception staff are all brilliant. Staff are really caring-I got massive support when my husband died. I can be seen 9 time out of 10 on the day.
Beccles,Busy phones,12/14/2022,3,"The phones are very busy, I was 27th in the queue and spent 4 days trying to get through to get an appointment, I finally got one today.  I don't feel that face to face appointments are as freely available as they were."
Beccles,Care good when seen,11/26/2021,4,I've found it difficult to get my child seen face to face when I think it has been needed.  Once we've been seen the care and advice has been good but I did struggle.
Beccles,Changed my life!,2/28/2017,5,"I have been treated for anxiety and depression for many years. This has mostly consisted of my medications being upped when I was going through a tough patch. The increases in medication left me in a zombie like state for most of the time. A new doctor joined the practice and when I saw him for the first time he told me I was taking too many mess. And he arranged a referral to a psychiatrist who was very, very helpful. After this I was sent for sleep therapy and then for lessons about anxiety and my life is transformed!!! Much for the better."
Beccles,Choice over appointment type,12/14/2022,4,"It's been ok today I was 13th in the queue and it took about 15 mins to get through. I was given a choice of a phone call or face to face appointment and chose to see a doctor so its worked really well for me. I usually see different doctors as they are all good, the paramedic takes time with you and goes through things well. I feel that as restrictions have lifted things are easing and there is a return to choice of appointment style.  We have found it difficult to get home visits for our father and then staff speak to him and then have to repeat everything again to us as we're not there when they talk to him."
Beccles,Clinically very good,8/17/2018,4,"Clinically it is very good though I am often late being called in-40 mins. today. I do understand, it is because of demand. They try very hard and overall it is ok."
Beccles,Clinicians are now very good,8/17/2018,4,"It could be a bit easier to get a routine appointment and sometimes I am a bit late being called in BUT I think the clinicians are now very, very good."
Beccles,Coming here for many years,8/25/2019,5,I've been coming here for many years. Everyone I have found to be helpful and supportive. I have no issues with appointment making.
Beccles,Confidence in Doctors and nurses,11/26/2021,4,I do feel that some issues need to be seen as I've found that phone consultations are not addressing the problems I have. It's meant that I've had more need to contact the surgery than if I'd just been given a face to face appointment.
Beccles,Considerable waits to see doctor,3/13/2017,4,There can be considerable delay when I attend for an appointment
Beccles,Continuity is a difficulty and delays at appointments,3/13/2017,4,Continuity (seeing the same dr.) is a difficulty and there is more delay to see a named doctor and there are some I prefer not to see. Delay at appointments can also be issue.
Beccles,Delays in being seen on time and cannot get appointments,3/13/2017,5,There is often a delay in being seen on time at an appointment. Getting appointments is horrific-I have waited 2 weeks for a routine appointment.
Beccles,Didn’t even get to speak,1/18/2021,1,"Phone rang so quick and stopped less than one ring ,they left a message to say they would speak if phoned back before four ,so I did and was told they are busy callback tomorrow they were the ones that asked me too book n appointment in the first place"
Beccles,Difficult to get face to face appointment,12/14/2022,4,"I've struggled to get a face to face appointment with a doctor. It's just more difficult to get them as the preference is to deal with issues over the phone. Everything they do is very good its just that you can't see them easily, although today I have been asked to come in."
Beccles,Doctors are good but don't like any doctors,9/14/2017,5,Not keen on doctors generally.  Doctors are all good - it's just that I don't like any doctors
Beccles,Doctors are very thorough,5/30/2017,5,The Doctors are very thorough so I don't mind waiting
Beccles,Drs can overrun,5/30/2017,5,Sometimes I go in (to the consulting room) a few minutes after the appointment time due to Dr. overrun. I have to wait about 2 weeks for an appointment if I want to see my own doctor.
Beccles,Dr's seem to keep changing and hard to get appointments,3/17/2017,3,"All the very good doctors seem to have gone. I have had one experience of bad attitude, a clinician was very poor and I wouldn't go back to them. It would be good to get a routine appointment in under  weeks."
Beccles,Everything works pretty well,4/5/2018,4,They can run quite late which isn't always a problem for me (I have some flexibility) but could be for others. Otherwise everything works pretty well for me
Beccles,Excellent,11/26/2021,5,"The triage system works well and I've had both phone and face to face consultations and both have addressed the issues I had. Staff are happy and I'm pleased with the way the explain things, it works so well."
Beccles,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Been a patient since the 1960s .  All great
Beccles,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,top notch surgery.  My doctor is absolutely amazing.  She has pretty well saved me
Beccles,Excellent Care and Hard working Receptionists,10/5/2017,5,"I have been a patient at this surgery for many years, the doctors have always been good at explaining the steps in my treatment and medication. You sometimes have to wait a little longer than you would like for an appointment but as we are all aware this is a nationwide problem. The reception staff are always friendly and great you with a smile and go that extra mile to help you."
Beccles,Excellent care before & after heart surgery.,7/1/2021,5,Always received excellent care from doctors  nurses and staff. Doctor detected my heart condition and saved my life. They are brilliant .
Beccles,excellent doctors and staff,3/3/2021,5,"Everyone one there is always ready to listen to your problems and are very friendly, nothing is too much trouble."
Beccles,Face to face appointments difficult to get,4/13/2022,4,Even though we have letters from the hospital saying our child should be seen by his GP we have been unable to get an appointment. We were told to go to hospital for what turned out to be an ear infection and this would've been known if he'd been seen. The hospital were not happy that we had gone there for it.  More recently it has been easier to get a face to face and when you do see someone the care is good.  The My GP app works well as an alternative to contacting the surgery  but I find it hard to understand how we can see nurses easily but not a GP.
Beccles,"Fair. GP can be rude, receptionists very helpful",9/14/2017,3,"Receptionists are fine - very helpful.  My doctor can be rude.  Short tempered, lacks patience"
Beccles,Fairly good practice,12/14/2022,5,"For aappointments the surgery is ok and there are no particular issues but as a relatively new patient I've not been able to get my medication as they said they are looking at it. I've run out and still waiting for an explanation or for the medication to be allowed. It would be better if they explained the issues.  The nurse I've been seeing is great, really can't fault them."
Beccles,Feel they are excellent here,8/25/2019,4,If I want to see the same doctor I have to wait up to 4 weeks. I do feel that they are excellent here. Reception staff are very good. You do have to wait over 30 mins depending on the day.
Beccles,Friendly and helpful,12/14/2022,5,"I don't like that you rarely get to see a GP anymore however the telephone consultations do work and address the issues. The staff are very friendly, polite, understanding and helpful and I've been able to book INRs whenever they've been needed."
Beccles,Generally good.,8/25/2019,4,Getting an appointment if not urgent can be up to 3 weeks. Generally the surgery is good but the car park is small. We have locum doctors but would prefer more regular doctors. Could be sign up on how to operate water flow.
Beccles,Generally the staff are great but one GP is difficult,3/16/2017,4,Generally the staff are great with the exception of one GP whose attitude is a bit of a difficulty for me. Nurses are excellent at explaining everything but the doctors less so. The Practice seems less 'personal' than it used to.
Beccles,Get an appointment on the day,5/30/2017,5,It is usually 20 mins after my appointment time when I get in to see the doctor but I ring in and I can usually get an appointment on the day.
Beccles,Getting appointments ok,4/13/2022,4,I've been able to get blood tests easily and booked today's appointment a week ago. I've never had any long delays for them and have got other tests done quickly too. Although I speak English as second language and at times I find translation a bit difficult I have my family who can help.
Beccles,good,4/8/2020,4,some doctors seem like they don’t care. i personally recommend Dr (name removed).
Beccles,Good,8/25/2019,5,I get good treatment here and I feel they look after me and my wife.
Beccles,Good,7/3/2019,4,Delays at appointments are to be expected
Beccles,Good,7/3/2017,4,Works well. Can get appointments when needed.
Beccles,Good at trying to fit you in,8/17/2018,3,I reported to reception and waited quite a while and then found out that I hadn't been logged in! Good at trying to fit you in though.
Beccles,Good getting appointments some of the time,3/13/2017,4,"I understand the system so I book appointments for early on in the day as delays in the waiting room get worse as the day goes on. Overall they are all pretty good and will accommodate if they can. This said, an appointment can take 2 weeks."
Beccles,Good practice overall,11/5/2018,4,With some doctors we are called in late but they are prepared to spend a little extra time if needed so it all evens out I guess. It is a good practice overall
Beccles,"Good, would prefer more time with the GP",9/14/2017,4,I'm happy to wait to go in - doctor should be able to give you more time
Beccles,Great,11/26/2021,4,I have weekly blood tests to be able to have my chemo later in the week and I have no problems getting the appointments I need. I've had a phone consultation with the paramedic which went well as I was given antibiotics for a chest infection with out having to come in to the surgery.
Beccles,"great doctors,when you get to see one.",7/29/2021,3,No type 2 diabetes or blood pressure check for 18 months now and no sign of getting any.
Beccles,Great staff,11/26/2021,4,Routine appointments have been continuing throughout the pandemic. Staff have been great and it's generally working well at the moment for me.
Beccles,Happy with care,4/13/2022,5,I called this morning and have spoken to a GP who has then given me a face to face appointment so I am happy with how it has all worked.  I've never had any issues getting an appointment here and the care provided has always been good.
Beccles,Happy with care,11/26/2021,4,Have had phone consultations that have worked on the whole but at times a face to face appointment feels it would be more appropriate. Staff though explain issues well  and I'm happy with the care and support they provided.
Beccles,Happy with doctors,12/14/2022,5,"I've been able to get telephone appointments but I've not had a face to face for sometime. They do work but I don't feel they are ideal as seeing the patient is important. I've been happy with the doctors and nurses, theres no problem with the care and treatment. It would be good to have a more flexible system so that you don't have to call first thing to get an appointment, the system lets people down."
Beccles,hard working and very good,3/17/2017,5,I have been a patient for some years and the increase in demand has been apparent. They all work hard and a very good. It does take between one and two weeks for an appointment but an urgent appointment is usually available on the day if needed. I have had to wait 30 mins. after my appointment time but when I get in I don't feel rushed and i appreciate you can't have it both ways!
Beccles,Have to wait for continuity.,8/25/2019,4,You can have to wait over 30 mins before getting called in. I can have to wait 1-2 weeks to book an appointment to get continuity.
Beccles,Helpful staff,11/26/2021,5,Blood tests are available whenever I need them. The staff are so helpful and I have no complaints with how the surgery operates and nothing needs to change.
Beccles,Helpful staff,11/26/2021,4,"It's been fine at the moment, the telephone consultations have worked really well for me and I've not needed to have a face to face appointment"
Beccles,I am regularly seen 20 mins late,4/5/2018,4,I am regularly seen 20 mins late. I think this is simply down to demand and resources. Doctors are good and reception staff very friendly
Beccles,I book appointments online,4/5/2018,4,The surgery isn't dirty per se-it is more shabby and in need of a freshen up. I book my appointments online-this works much better for me.
Beccles,I can always get an 'on the day' emergency appt,4/5/2018,4,I have never-ever been seen on time. I have had to wait two weeks for this routine appointment which I guess is about average everywhere but I can always get an 'on the day' emergency appointment if I need one
Beccles,I don't have any problems,4/5/2018,5,Sometimes I have to wait and sometimes I don't. I have ALWAYS got an emergency appointment when I needed one. I don't have any problems with the practice.
Beccles,I got an appointment today.,5/30/2017,4,We are all pretty healthy so don't come that much. I called for an appointment at 8.00 this morning and had to re-dial a number of times to get through as it was busy.. That said I did get an appointment for today
Beccles,I have much more confidence,8/24/2018,4,Overall it isn't too bad. Doctors are much better nowadays (in my experience) and I have much more confidence. Appointment availability and timeliness are areas where improvements could still be made.
Beccles,I visit to make appointments,3/16/2017,4,I visit to make appointments because if I try to phone in it sometimes seems to ring for a long time
Beccles,I'm very happy here,4/5/2018,3,One doctor is excellent at explaining things to me. I had a very bad experience in the past but things are much better here now. I'm very happy to be a patient here
Beccles,improved significantly,5/30/2017,5,I have been a patient for some years and I would have to say the practice has improved significantly of late. I think my appointments are more in depth and look more at my current symptoms not at my past.
Beccles,It has improved over the last years,4/5/2018,4,It has improved over the last few years. There is more continuity now. We managed to get an 'on the day' appointment this morning
Beccles,It has improved significantly,11/5/2018,5,I have been a patient here for some years and despite the obvious increase in the demand for medical assistance things here are better than they used to be. No small trick! The practice has steadily improved (in my personal experience) over time
Beccles,It is brilliant!,8/24/2018,5,I moved house to a village near here and registered here. Compared with my last practice it is brilliant!. My new GP has been absolutely superb!!
Beccles,It suits me well,8/17/2018,5,I've been a patient here for quite a time. I'm retired and can come along anytime it suits me well. I think it had gotten better over the last few years.
Beccles,Just can’t get an appointment!,7/5/2022,2,"Call at 8am when they open, sat on the phone for 30 mins only to be told there’s no appointments for the day when call answered. Tried to do the app but can’t book appointments."
Beccles,Like moving back in time.,8/17/2018,2,"I moved to Brandon from a village in Cambridgeshire. I transferred from a large modern practice and this (surgery) is like moving back in time. It takes about two weeks to get a routine appointment, it is a bit of a worry as I am getting older."
Beccles,Long waiting times & doctor that doesn't engage,5/30/2017,5,It's very rare to get in at the appointment time-I have had to wait almost an hour on occasion. Also there is a doctor we decline to see because there is a lack of eye contact and  interaction.
Beccles,Love this surgery but...,8/18/2022,3,I love this surgery but it's not easy getting support from the doctors for family members I look after. I have power of attorney but the doctor still insists on talking to the person even though they have dementia and gets very confused.  It just makes eveything so much worse. It also means I have to stay with them if we need to contact the doctor as they won't talk to me unless they are there with me and I don't live with them.
Beccles,Lovely doctor,11/26/2021,5,Considering the circumstances they are doing excellently. My family sent in photos of something for me .and the doctor reviewed them and then gave me a prescription. I have a very caring doctor too which is lovely.
Beccles,Mainly talk to dr's on the phone,8/18/2022,2,"I've mainly talked to the doctors on the phone but I do not feel that this suits all circumstances as there is no discussion/ explanation and it feels that they aren't that interested. I do see one doctor who is very good but I didn't feel another was very supportive with mental health issues, just handed me tablets.  It would be great to be able to book appointments in advance as some issues aren't urgent or need dealing with on the day . Being able to book ahead of time would help with work and transport too. I do feel that the receptionists are really nice and helpful."
Beccles,male doctor i spoke with was very cobative,6/21/2022,1,"i only rang to correct a prescription  phone call 
intonation was agressive from the start and made it clear he didnt want me in the practice
he said he ran tight ship and didnt want people like me"
Beccles,Much improved,8/17/2018,3,I am now seen much closer to the actual appointment time than used to be the case-much improved. In fact most aspects seem to have improved in the last few years. Emergency appointment (on the day) are fine but routine take about a week.
Beccles,My doctor is fantastic,8/24/2018,5,My doctor is fantastic-he is so knowledgeable and thorough. At my first appointment he had taken the time to read all my notes before seeing me. He reviewed my medications and rationalised them. I now feel so much better all the time. I only see him now as (as far as I am concerned) he really has his finger on the pulse.
Beccles,My GP app works well,4/13/2022,4,"The My GP app works well and allows me to manage my parents health care needs although it does meant that they are less involved as they can not access online services and find speaking/ hearing on the phone difficult.  We have a face to face appointment today which is great but I would like to see easier access to face to face appointments  going forward but understand the situation is still difficult.  The surgery send letters out asking you to book an appointment for something, could they not just book an appointment and send you the date like the hospital does?"
Beccles,Never had an issue,12/18/2020,5,I have always received a first-class service from this surgery. I have not had any issue on any visit over the last 15 years.
Beccles,Never seem bothered,10/17/2020,1,if you go with anything hurting it never gets examined. Only advice seems to be paracetamol iron tablets and no caffine. They are the worst doctors i have ever been with. I wish we could move for better doctors surgery ):
Beccles,Nice little country practice,5/30/2017,5,This is a nice little country practice. The reception staff are all warm and friendly and eager to do what they can for you. Drs are all pretty good as well. All in all I'm happy to be a patient here.
Beccles,No issues,10/31/2022,5,I hardly ever need to go to the surgery but when I have needed to be seen I've been able to get an appointment with no issues. From my perspective it all works well.
Beccles,Not available to see patients,5/19/2021,1,"Unwilling to visit an elderly patient with an ongoing condition who is feeling breathless and generally unwell, who has no means of transport to get to surgery if the dr was willing to see them face to face - but will not even do that."
Beccles,Not seen anyone for some time,12/14/2022,1,I haven't seen anyone for some time and have only had phone calls with the doctors which have worked ok but I do feel I need to see someone. I asked today to be seen and I've been given an appointment to see a doctor.  The phones when you call the surgery are very busy and by the time you get through am or pm you can be told there are no call backs available and to try again the next day.  Getting a non urgent issue addressed has also been difficult.
Beccles,Noticed improvements,8/25/2019,4,"Have noticed significant improvements with the reception staff, they are now very helpful. Doctor is fantastic, rate highly."
Beccles,Nurses are great,8/18/2022,4,I try to see the nurses if at all possible over the doctors as they explain things well and have time to listen where as the doctors don't always do this when they are busy. By and large its a pretty good surgery and I like that I'm able to get my blood tests done at the surgery as it is much easier than travelling to Newmarket or West Suffolk Hospital.
Beccles,Nurses are usually running on time,5/30/2017,4,I always arrive for my appointments on time- nurses are usually running on time but there is usually a delay with doctors. Online booking is good.
Beccles,On Mondays you can't get through on the phone,3/16/2017,4,On Mondays you can't get through on the phone to book an appointment. It would also be good to be notified when existing doctors leave the practice and when new ones join.
Beccles,One of the doctors is very thorough,8/17/2018,3,"I am always 10-30 mins late being called in but I never feel rushed when I am in the consultation though. One of the doctors is very thorough and interested, the others not so much."
Beccles,"Overall, clinically quite good",4/5/2018,4,Overall the surgery is clinically quite good. MY doctor is VERY good-I always book on her working days. I have just discovered online booking and it is really good.
Beccles,Penalised for being late,3/17/2017,3,If you are five minutes late they won't see you but there can be as much as a 45 minute delay the other way around.
Beccles,Phone consultations work,11/26/2021,4,Providing that its a routine issue like blood tests there are no problems getting an appointment. The phone consultations do the job but I'm not so comfortable with it compared to having a face to face appointment as it gives you more confidence if you've been seen.
Beccles,Phones are busy,9/14/2022,4,"I've not actually seen a GP in quite some time but I've always had conversations with them when needed which have addressed the issues. Once through to the surgery the staff are good and the Emergency Care Practitioner is great, they tale time to explain issues very well"
Beccles,phones very busy,11/4/2022,3,"My last two vitamin B12 have been delayed by weeks as it's been very difficult to get the appointment. Having to call at either 8 or 2 when you work is very difficult when you may have to wait up to 40 minutes. A family member has also had difficulties with different staff members having differing opinions, which has been incredibly stressful."
Beccles,Poor appointment allocation system,9/23/2021,2,"Phoned at 8am and 2pm on 2 separate ocassions to book the appointment that I need and told there's no appointments left, call back tomorrow at 8am. Not helpful, rules are the rules etc...disappointing"
Beccles,Poor appointment system,3/5/2022,1,"Why are we still having to phone for a doctors appointment?? At 8 or 2. 
For people that work this system is ridiculous! When you get an appointment you don’t get a time. When can we start to book appointments on line at a time we want it?  You can book other appointments on line!"
Beccles,Poor attitude from receptionists and often given cheap drugs,9/14/2017,2,Attitude of receptionists can be a bit off.  Also no follow up for Diabetes jab.  Often given cheapest drugs rather than what is best for me
Beccles,"Poor. Clinicians good, receptionists poor",9/14/2017,2,Clinicians are fine but reception staff are not so good
Beccles,Pretty good all round,11/5/2018,4,The practice is pretty good all round. Getting an appointment isn't too bad. Sometimes I am a few minutes late being called in but all the clinical staff I have seen here have been lovely
Beccles,Pretty good.,8/25/2019,4,It can be challenging to get a blood test. Many people have trouble hearing and a screen giving name or tannoy would be helpful. They are pretty good here though.
Beccles,Quick appointment,8/18/2022,5,I called yesterday afternoon and they arranged an appointment for me to see the emergency care practitioner this morning which has worked really well.
Beccles,Quite efficient,12/14/2022,4,I've just had a pre-booked appointment for my flu vaccination which was easy to get. For urgent on the day issues it's been fine to get appointments and I've been seen on the day.  Sometimes having to call first thing is a bit frustrating but I'm happy with the care provided by staff and the nurses are really good.
Beccles,Really good doctor,11/26/2021,5,I have a really good doctor who reacted really quickly and referred me to hospital. The appointment for the hospital came through the next morning and I had the appointment with in a week. Getting my blood tests are fine as they're booked in advance but getting a face to face is a bit more challenging.
Beccles,reception staff are brilliant,8/17/2018,5,"I don't come here very often but in the past there have been some waits to be called in. I have nothing much to complain about other than to be more prompt. Reception staff are brilliant, doctors are pretty good too. I am happy that I come here."
Beccles,Reception staff are exemplary.,3/17/2017,4,There are pressures on the practice and appointments can be a bit of an issue. hi said the reception staff are exemplary and do all they can to fit me in asap.
Beccles,reception staff are variable,11/5/2018,3,"Some of the receptionists aren't very polite-they can be 'off' with me. To be fair that's not all of them, some are helpful, some are not, it is variable"
Beccles,Saturday morning surgery is good,8/17/2018,4,Getting an appointment is difficult if you work full time-though monthly Saturday morning surgery helps with this. They look after my son very well.
Beccles,Some of the doctors are really good,4/5/2018,3,Some of the doctors are really good-but not all! A delay of up to 20 mins in being called in to the appointment is not unusual but if I arrive late I don't get seem.
Beccles,Staff are BRILLIANT,4/5/2018,5,"Every time we have been here we have been satisfied. That said, probably only on one occasion have we been seen on time in recent years! You can't be late though. Staff are BRILLIANT"
Beccles,Staff are good,11/26/2021,4,"They are running late this morning, 45 mins, not normally this long though. I'm happy to see the nurse and staff are all very good at explaining things and the care is great. The nurse even picked up on something I hadn't even come in for which was great."
Beccles,Staff are great,8/18/2022,5,I've had no problems getting appointments and have had a pre booked appointment to see the nurse today. Staff are great and I've had no issues getting help when I've needed it. Overall I'm very happy with the surgery.
Beccles,Staff are usually very helpful,3/17/2017,3,"Staff are usually very helpful but I don't think the doctors are as good as they were, I'm never seen on time for an appointment. When you do get in you can only discuss one issue and it feels hurried. Old people need time to answer questions, not 2 seconds."
Beccles,Staff are very good but getting appointments problematic,3/16/2017,4,Getting an appointment with a specific doctor can take a while. The length of time that the book is open (i.e. how far in advance it is possible to book) seems to vary from time to time. The staff are all very good.
Beccles,"Staff attitudes vary, ok getting appointments",3/13/2017,4,"Staff attitude depends on who you get (GP). Getting an appointment isn't too bad and you can always attend as an emergency on the day, routine is 2-3 weeks. Reception staff are very good but one nurse is very brusque to the point of being rude."
Beccles,Staff very helpful and friendly,1/11/2021,5,"Spoke to receptionist and explained what the problem was, they were very kind and professional and asked me to call back at 2. Phoned back at 2 was 10th in the queue! Got to speak to another receptionist who said someone would call me this afternoon and within 10 minutes I had a call, explained the problem and within the hour I was picking up a prescription. Fantastic service."
Beccles,Staff was very helpful,10/24/2018,4,I don't use the practice very often as we are quite a healthy family. Overall the practice has been ok but getting appointments and being seen on time were the main issues on the times we have had to go. That said I did have to take my daughter for injections recently and the staff was very helpful on that visit-particularly the nurse
Beccles,Struggled in pregnancy to be seen,4/13/2022,4,"I had an issue that came up in the later stages of my pregnancy but I couldn't get seen by a GP,  in the end my midwife  contacted the surgery and I was then seen and treated. I was also told by a GP over the phone to go to A&E, which they weren't happy about, for something that they could've treated.  Although I have had issues getting seen myself I've not had the same issues when it comes to the care of my baby, the care provided has been very good and we've got a face to face appointment with a GP today."
Beccles,Superficial explanations of treatment,3/13/2017,3,The explanation of treatment can be a bit superficial but they are good if you question them. Appointments take a while to get.
Beccles,The Doctor seemed very uncaring and arrogant.,7/9/2020,1,"Go somewhere else, seriously. I’ve never met such an unprofessional uncaring doctor such as here. He dismissed everything I was explaining to him and genuinely didn’t seem bothered."
Beccles,The service has got worse & hard to get an appointment,3/16/2017,3,I have been a patient here for many years and things have got worse not better. It can take 2-3 weeks for a routine appointment now.
Beccles,The staff are very welcoming,11/5/2018,4,I have registered relatively recently. This was a transfer from a practice where I didn't feel well supported. The staff here were very welcoming and made the process of registering very easy for me.
Beccles,The whole team treat me as an individual,10/2/2021,5,"It doesn't matter who in the team I speak to, I feel as if my needs are important and I am valued as a patient."
Beccles,They are overloaded and long delays in booking appts,3/17/2017,3,They are overloaded.There is a long wait for get an appointment and they are tardy on the day. There are too many locums and things seem to have deteriorated over time.
Beccles,They are very accommodating for appointments,3/13/2017,5,I work shifts which can make things a bit difficult but they are very accommodating
Beccles,They give me plenty of time.,8/25/2019,4,You do have to wait a while for the doctor (1-2 weeks). I am very happy with the doctors and they give me plenty of time.
Beccles,Things have settled down,11/26/2021,5,"Getting blood tests has been fine. I've also had appointments with the paramedic and they've been able to sort out the issues, he gives me confidence and overall things have now settled down a bit."
Beccles,Timed call backs are great,8/18/2022,4,"The phones are busy when contacting the surgery but the timed call backs by GPs are great.  The nurses are wonderful and put you at ease and are easy to talk to and I've had no issues getting to see them. The emergency care practitioner is very good too, again they have time for you to discuss the issues."
Beccles,Treatment explanation varies,8/25/2019,4,Getting an appointment you do have to wait up to 4 weeks if you want the same GP. Treatment explanation is rated depending on who you see.
Beccles,"UNABLE TO SEE A NURSE TO LOOK IN MY EAR,",7/29/2022,1,"I asked to see a nurse to see if I had any cotton wool left in ear after taking a shower, I was told to go to A and E at Bury as there was no Nurse on duty, I then asked if i could see a Dr as it take about 10 seconds to see there was any cotton wool left, I was then told that a DR could not do it as there was not a nurse on duty,   I then tried to explain it would take 30 seconds at the very most, I was then told to phone back at 2oclock and somebody would talk to me. I really find this to totally unbelievable. No wonder the NHS  is struggling with this type of service."
Beccles,Understandable delays,5/30/2017,5,demand for services has increased substantially and as a result there are understandable delays at time. I don't find these to be a problem.
Beccles,Unhelpful and dismissive,9/10/2020,1,Unhelpful and dismissive
Beccles,Unpleasant experience...,7/23/2021,2,"One of the receptionists is abrasive and lacks empathy. I tried to explain my mental health issues and explained that I have to rely on a friend to take me to appointments. They were not interested. I only needed a blood test. I asked if they could call me if any one cancelled during the following week, as my friend was available to go with me. They refused point blank saying ""we don’t do that here’’.  I thought mental health was supposed to be better understood these days...clearly not, it seems."
Beccles,Unwilling to change medication,8/25/2019,4,"I saw a locum doctor about 4 months ago and he was unwilling to change my regular pain medication so I then had to wait and see the regular GP, which was another two week wait. To see a doctor is a longer wait than for a nurse. Car park too small."
Beccles,Vaccinations and blood tests fine,11/26/2021,3,Have had a number of phone consultations but none have solved the problems and 4 weeks later I've seen someone but I'm still having difficulties. Doctors and nurses are lovely but I do find that reception can be a little unhelpful as they just say call back at 8am when all the appointments are gone that day. I understand that they can only say what they are told to say when all the appointments are gone but it doesn't help the problem.
Beccles,Very difficult to get past the receptionist.,6/21/2021,3,Some time you need to talk with a qualified doctor.
Beccles,Very good with my son,8/17/2018,5,"The practice is very good with my son, I can get him an appointment pretty easily when he is unwell. I don't have much cause to come in myself but it is top marks or the way they look after him."
Beccles,Very good.,8/25/2019,4,The doctors here are very good. I book appointments online. You do have to wait to get into the surgery. Car park is too small.
Beccles,Very happy overall,8/25/2019,5,When I try to book appointment online it always says no appointments. Very happy with surgery overall.
Beccles,Very pleasant staff,12/14/2022,4,I don't come often but the staff are always pleasant. I was told to call at 8am for a nurse appointment which I did but when I got through after 1/2 hr there were no appointments available. I was then told that they could book me an appointment the next day so I didn't really need to be calling with everyone else first thing in the morning for a nurse appointment.  Staff just need to be a little more careful that they are telling patients the correct things. Other than this the surgery is good.
Beccles,Very positive impact,8/24/2018,4,Nurses and paramedic seem to have had a very positive impact on the practice. Things seem 'quicker' somehow. There are less frustrations and better service.
Beccles,Very thorough and professional,8/24/2018,5,I transferred to here from another practice. I find that there is a great attitude from reception through to the clinicians. Nurses and doctors are thorough and professional. I am very glad that I made the move.
Beccles,Waiting for appointment too long,3/13/2017,3,I have an ongoing eye condition which sometimes needs immediate medication when I get a 'flare up'. I once had to wait 2-3 weeks to see a GP then 4-5 weeks for an appointment at West Suffolk Hospital. When I was seen I was told off by the clinician for waiting so long!
Beccles,Waiting time 3 to 4 weeks is to long,3/24/2018,3,Receptionists are fine doctors are somewhat good. But what bugs me is they never seem to want to refer any health issues you have. I get a sense this is because of cost. I would love to be told I am wrong.
Bildeston,100% brilliant,11/26/2021,5,"Its an efficient surgery with skillful and really helpful staff, nothing needs to change they are doing a great job and we're lucky to have them."
Bildeston,5 star,6/10/2015,5,5 star
Bildeston,A good surgery,11/26/2021,5,It's a good surgery and I'm very happy with all the staff. I do find the phone difficult and would rather be able to book an appointment if I feel one is needed in advance so that you can plan better.
Bildeston,A great surgery,4/25/2022,5,"I have no issues, its a great surgery where you can get seen quickly by a GP when needed and issues are sorted out quickly, even the phone calls with a doctor work well. I am concerned generally that everything is now phone or online based and although I can manage with this there is an assumption you can go online and not everyone can. It would be great if the phone system could tell you where you are in the queue to give you a rough idea how long you might have to wait to speak to someone."
Bildeston,A little frustrating,8/18/2021,4,I find it a little frustrating that it's not as easy to have an appointment with a doctor in person as it was but referrals that have been made recently have all happened well. I just feel that if my GP actually saw me they'd realise how much my condition has deteriorated. Overall though I'm happy with the care but would like a face to face appointment more easily.
Bildeston,A really good practice,8/18/2021,5,I use electronic prescriptions and I've had telephone consultations but haven't needed an actual appointment recently. Its a really good proactive surgery who take a planned approach to my ongoing health conditions. I would like to see a return to the open surgery in some form as and when possible although understand this may not be in the short term.
Bildeston,A really good surgery,8/30/2018,5,"It's a really good surgery and it's great to have the 'turn up and wait' system, it's very good. Getting home visits, very fortunate."
Bildeston,A really great surgery,6/20/2017,5,A really great surgery. Being able to go in the morning and wait my turn to be seen is great and works really well with the appointments in the afternoon.
Bildeston,A very good surgery,4/25/2022,4,"The surgery over the years has been excellent, with great staff. For me the system in place works very well and I like that you can just have a phone call with a GP as it resolves the issues without the need to go in to the surgery.  For my husband who is hard of hearing the phone triage really doesn't work and is preventing him contacting the surgery.  Overall the care provided by staff is very good."
Bildeston,A very helpful service,6/4/2019,5,"A very helpful service, I never feel rushed.
I am very happy with this service."
Bildeston,A wonderful surgery,1/25/2018,5,A wonderful surgery staffed by great people. The morning sessions are really great and if you need an appointment you can go in the afternoon.
Bildeston,Absolutely first class. 5 stars,7/10/2020,5,Have used their centre for more than 35 years. It is outstanding service and a jewel in the crown of the NHS.
Bildeston,Accommodating staff,12/23/2022,4,"I've had no problems getting appointments on the day or prearranged with the nurse. I feel its all working well at the moment and the staff are always good. I've not used econsult, mainly because there are no issues getting through on the phone so there is no need really."
Bildeston,Accommodating staff,3/14/2019,4,"Generally works quite well, if you attend the morning session you will be seen, sometimes the waits can be quite long. I do use the appointments in the afternoon as well for routine issuess the appointments are in advance and wouldn't work for on the day .  Staff are helpful and accommodating. There are times when medications are not made up on time and you have to come back to pick them up another day."
Bildeston,Always brilliant,12/23/2022,5,"Reception are friendly and helpful when you call and every experience with any of the staff has always been great, there really is nothing to change. I mainly see the same GP which is good and with the children we tend to see the nurses."
Bildeston,Always good,8/22/2018,5,"The surgery has always been good. You can come to the surgery whenever you want during the morning and wait your turn, you don't have to make an appointment and you can call before you attend to check if your doctor is on that day. It would help if the car park was a bit bigger."
Bildeston,Always seen,8/22/2018,5,"I've always been seen on the day, it can be a bit late at times but I've always been referred to hospital quickly when needed. The afternoon appointments work well too. The staff are polite and courteous  and on the whole it works well. The loss of a GP has made it a bit slower in the mornings."
Bildeston,Amazing surgery,6/2/2023,5,A really amazing surgery with brilliant doctors and other staff who are always polite and do all they can to help.
Bildeston,An excellent surgery,6/4/2019,4,"It really is fabulous here, it's an excellent surgery. The wait to see the doctor using the walk-in system does take a while but at least you get seen on the day. I do not feel rushed in the surgery either.
There is a pharmacy on site which is also open on Saturdays."
Bildeston,Appointment system really works,4/13/2016,5,I really love the fact I can turn up on the day and wait my turn for an appointment.
Bildeston,Appointment system works well,10/17/2016,5,"You need to be there by 10.30 but you will be assured of an appointment that day.  The afternoon appointment system works very well too.  Bigger car park would help.
Good that they have a prescription delivery service"
Bildeston,Appointments,9/29/2016,5,More appointment times would be nice!
Bildeston,Blood tests easy to arrange,4/25/2022,4,I come to the surgery for regular blood tests which are easy to arrange. Luckily  I've not needed an appointment with a GP recently. The staff are all very good and I hope that in future face to face appointments will become more available.
Bildeston,Blood tests easy to book,4/25/2022,5,"I've had a regular blood test this morning which are easy to book. I've also been triaged and spoken to a GP for an issue which worked really well and addressed the problem. Its a brilliant surgery, they do everything well."
Bildeston,Brilliant,12/23/2022,5,Spoke to reception and was given an appointment straightaway today. Generally I get to see the same GP which is really good. It's been really good and working well for us whenever we've needed it and reception are always very nice when we're talking to them.
Bildeston,Brilliant,12/23/2022,5,They reallly are a great surgery. Wonderful support provided by all the staff. It's the little things like the doctors coming out to get you which makes all the difference.
Bildeston,Brilliant,12/19/2022,5,"Never had a problem getting appointments and I actually feel that we're waiting less time now  and there are fewer people in the waiting room, so I prefer the newer system. I don't feel that anything needs to change or improve, it all works very well. The doctors and other staff are great, helpful and accommodating."
Bildeston,Brilliant,11/26/2021,5,Always 100% here they are doing a great job. I would prefer to see a return to the old system when possible as prefer talking to someone in person rather than on the phone. The only problem I've had is that the surgery can not see my xrays from Ipswich hospital for some reason.
Bildeston,Brilliant staff,12/19/2018,5,"The mix of the drop in and the appointments is good, it means you can plan ahead but also be assured you will see someone on the day if you want to.  Staff are brilliantly helpful and friendly. They have stopped the weekend session which was a shame. The explanations provided are good."
Bildeston,Brilliant surgery,9/14/2022,5,"It's a brilliant surgery where you can phone up and speak to the great staff who will then give you an appointment if it is needed.  I have a lot of confidence in the doctors, it really is wonderful and nothing needs to change."
Bildeston,Brilliant Surgery,11/19/2019,5,This surgery is simply brilliant.
Bildeston,Brilliant surgery,10/5/2018,5,A brilliant surgery! We are very fortunate to have such a good surgery.
Bildeston,Can alway see someone,8/22/2018,5,"I like the open morning surgery sessions, it means you can always see someone and it works really well."
Bildeston,Can see doctor of choice,8/22/2018,5,We are so well looked after by the surgery and the system in place works so well for me as you can ask to see which doctor you would prefer to see. The telephone is always answered and the dispensary always has the medication you need and the overall care provided by the practice has been excellent.
Bildeston,Can't always get in,8/22/2018,5,"Difficult to get appointments in the afternoon especially for specific doctors, you can't always get in in the morning. The area the surgery covers is very large and there are too many patients. My doctor is remarkable, she just keeps going until she identifies the problem. I'd prefer this system was kept but having advanced appointments doesn't always work as you are better by the time you get to your appointment."
Bildeston,Can't fault them,6/4/2019,5,"Can't fault them here, all are great.
We are so lucky to have a walk in service. I have to wait but at least I get seen on the day."
Bildeston,Check ups by phone don't always work,8/18/2021,4,"The way in which some check ups are done over the phone really doesn't work and it feels a bit of a tick box exercise. How can checks on lungs be done over the phone when previously the chest was listened to, this hasn't been done since the start of covid.  For general appointments the triage system has worked well for me when I needed antibiotics but it doesn't suit all situations. Picking up prescriptions from outside the building works well and I do feel that I would get to see a doctor if I really needed to."
Bildeston,Delightful staff,9/14/2022,5,"The surgery staff are all very helpful and appointments are good to get. I tend to call rather than go online but the staff are delightful and go above and beyond so there is nothing that needs to change here. Losing the only female GP is a great loss, she is wonderful, it would be nice to have access to a female GP at the practice going forward."
Bildeston,Diabetic clinics have continued to run,8/18/2021,4,"It's worked very well for me, the triage system is a bit tricky at times as you have to say what the issue is but I've always got an appointment when it's been needed. Throughout covid the diabetic clinic and other health checks continued to take place which was reassuring and I really can't fault the care provided."
Bildeston,Diagnosed over the phone,2/16/2023,2,I called the surgery but I was diagnosed over the phone. If I had been seen in person and had a full examination it would've led  to a correct diagnosis and prevented an emergency A&E admission. The old system of waiting for an appointment was much better.
Bildeston,Difficult appointment system,5/31/2015,3,"Only able to get appointment by booking weeks in advance unless you can attend the drop in clinic which is Monday to Friday 8.30am until 10.30am, this is hard as I am self employed and work most mornings. My daughter has a few health issues which sometimes need addressing the same day, if I call in the mid morning or afternoon for an appointment it is quite hard to get unless I really push as they say afternoons are for people who have booked weeks before. However With this all said the doctors and staff are very good, it just needs a better appointment system that caters for all ages. I can see how this works for retired or unemployed people but not people with children or are employed."
Bildeston,Drs are fantastic,8/18/2021,5,"I'm completely happy with how it is all working at the surgery, the Dr's are fantastic, kind and understanding and when you need them are really there for you."
Bildeston,Easy to get appointments,4/25/2022,5,"I tend to see the nurses the most and it's easy to get appointments when I need them. The system in place works well and ensures you get an appropriate appointment with the right clinician. The surgery do very well and the staff are friendly, courteous and helpful."
Bildeston,"Efficient, Effective Service",8/18/2015,5,"Efficient, Effective service"
Bildeston,Everything done well,9/14/2022,5,"Absolutely wonderful. So sad that Dr x (name removed) is leaving, its a great loss. Everything is very well done here. I would prefer not to have to go through the triage process and talk to my own GP all the time but understand that this isn't always possible.  Don't let Dr x go!"
Bildeston,Excellent,12/23/2022,5,"Extremely helpful, easy to contact and they put the patient first. Even though they are one doctor down as a patient you don't feel any less cared for, they are great."
Bildeston,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Having the open surgery session (8.30 - 10.30) is really beneficial.  I don't mind waiting to be seen at all and I don't mind waiting to be seen at all and I always try to use this if possible.  The nurse practitioner is really good.  I've never felt rushed and I've always been given the time I need.
Bildeston,excellent,9/14/2017,5,They are very good.  They are very efficient.  I really like the open surgery sessions first thing in the morning;  it works very well.  The only thing I don't like is the use of the telephone press 1 or 2 system
Bildeston,excellent,9/14/2017,5,his surgery offers an open surgery Mon - Fri and it really does work.  I've been at the surgery for years and I've never had a problem getting an appointment
Bildeston,Excellent - like the open surgery,1/11/2016,5,GP surgery one of the last to offer an open surgery in the am. which we do not wish to lose.
Bildeston,Excellent - Outstanding 5*,10/25/2019,5,Excellent all round each department very good you have wonderful team dispensary is outstanding 5* first class they have helped me many times Dr (name removed) listens and is extremely good at explaining what’s wrong with you I feel safe in his care
Bildeston,Excellent access to the medical team,9/12/2019,5,Helpful and courteous staff in all areas. The Health Centre is pro-active and services and facilities are constantly expanding and improving.
Bildeston,Excellent surgery,6/26/2023,4,"Excellent surgery, no complaints, I go every 3 months to get a B12 shot, I see the diabetic nurse. Attitudes at this surgery are very good from all staff."
Bildeston,Fantastic,9/14/2022,5,"Nothing is too much trouble for staff. It's a family surgery like you had years ago. They ring you back quickly and are then seen really quickly, 1/2 hour today. It's an amazing surgery and I really can't fault any aspect of it."
Bildeston,Fantastic,3/14/2019,5,"This surgery is fantastic, you can always see a doctor, have a blood test or see a nurse . You do have to wait but it's acceptable and understandable. It really works well. Staff are all very good, they do everything so that the surgery runs smoothly. If the surgery stays like this it will be great"
Bildeston,Fantastic .brilliant.  Caring.,3/23/2020,5,Always there to help.
Bildeston,Fantastic surgery,8/17/2016,5,Our surgery is fantastic. Always able to see the GP when necessary
Bildeston,Fewer face to face appointments,9/14/2022,3,"I find it difficult with fewer face to face appointments. Phone calls with the doctor are difficult as I have trouble getting across the whole situation and issues I'm experiencing. 
 It doesn't seem to work for me as I do not feel that issues are being addressed as quickly as a face to face would.  I've had to go private for a procedure as the waiting time was over 26 weeks at Ipswich but there is limited co ordination between the private hospital and the surgery and I feel I've been left to it because I decided to go private."
Bildeston,Fine at the moment,11/26/2021,5,"It's fine at the moment as been able to get face to face appointments when they've been needed so from my perspective it works well. I tend to use the online system now for my results as I found I had to wait for a GP to call me back, which could be a while, as the receptionists are unable to tell you your results."
Bildeston,First class,11/26/2021,5,"Everything at the surgery is very well done. You're quick to be seen, get good advice and I feel really well supported with my long term condition. Amazing really, very lucky to be here."
Bildeston,First class service easy to get appointment.,10/28/2016,5,"Full range of services. First class monitoring of long term conditions. The cream on the cake has to be the continued provision of open surgery Monday to Friday mornings, backed up with appointments in the afternoon. Also urgent need cover on Saturday morning. Public Access Defibrillator for out of hours cover."
Bildeston,Friendly staff,12/19/2018,4,"The walk in sessions in the morning work very well an you know you will be seen as it can be difficult to get an appointment. Staff are friendly, they are pretty good here. Staff also provide a good amount of information and explanations are clear."
Bildeston,Friendly surgery,12/19/2018,5,"The availability of appointments / the open morning session is very good. Having the combination of the open session and the appointments in the afternoon works well. Its a friendly surgery, they put you at ease and its a relaxed environment. Nothing needs to improve and on occasions they really have gone above and beyond."
Bildeston,Friendly surgery,8/22/2018,5,"A very friendly surgery, you can always get seen on the day with the morning session. Even for blood tests you can be seen quickly on the day which is different to my previous practice. Having outreach services at the surgery is really good. Pre-booking appointments means you may have to wait a while.  The Saturday appointments are also great to have."
Bildeston,Frustrating,11/26/2021,3,"The care and staff are great when you do get in but the practicalities of getting an appointment now are frustrating. Its difficult with the new system in place to get seen. I also really don't like that you have to queue up outside to collect your prescription, it's ok now but not so nice when it's cold."
Bildeston,Get seen easily,12/19/2018,5,"I like that you can come down to the surgery and wait your turn to be seen by a doctor. Being able to choose between the morning session or afternoon appointments works well. Staff are friendly, helpful and pleasant. Mainly I get the information I need from staff and understand what is said."
Bildeston,good,7/3/2019,4,Gfor up to 2 hrs.  Try to avoid going reallybut can wait ood to have the open surgery session
Bildeston,Good availability of appointments,12/19/2018,5,"There is very good appointment availability at the surgery, if you're really unwell you just have to turn up during the morning and you will be seen. Generally very good especially when compared to other local surgeries.  I like having the continuity with my doctor, means that she knows me well."
Bildeston,Good but miss how it was,11/26/2021,4,All staff including reception staff are kind and helpful. There is now more of a delay to be seen now so it's not so convenient as you have to speak to a GP before being given an appointment and you can't just pop down for advice. The pharmacy call to let me know if my normal medications are not available which is really great.
Bildeston,Good house visits,4/2/2016,5,"My doctor visits me at home roughly every four weeks, normally on a Friday.  I don't really know when he is coming but it will be soon. I like him coming and he examines me each time, he is a really friendly person."
Bildeston,Good mix of appointments and open session,8/22/2018,5,"The flexibility of having the appointments and the open session in the morning is really good. The staff are always helpful and I'm confident in the practice, they work quickly to diagnose issues and refer you on to hospital."
Bildeston,GP ‘battle-fatigued’.,1/23/2018,5,"GP’s unable to refer for MRI only able to refer into pathway system, regardless of clinical need.
Regularly have to prescribe addictive opiates for pain relief whilst patients wait to be seen."
Bildeston,GPs are great,8/22/2018,5,"They are lovely, you can get appointments when you need them and I use both the morning and afternoon sessions. Everything works well and the staff are all helpful and the GPs are great."
Bildeston,Great surgery,4/25/2022,5,I've not needed to see a GP face to face for 2 years but I have regular blood tests which are always easy to book and arrange. The staff at the surgery always do their best and its a great surgery
Bildeston,Great surgery and system,6/15/2017,5,A really great surgery and the turn up and wait system works really well.  Just great
Bildeston,Happy with how it works,8/18/2021,4,A very good surgery and very happy with how it all works. The phone message is very long when you call in and could be shortened a bit. Although I struggle with my hearing I do find that I can communicate well with reception and it all runs smoothly.
Bildeston,Happy with the surgery,10/5/2018,5,"Really like the morning session offered at the surgery, it works very well."
Bildeston,Has changed massively,9/14/2022,5,"It has changed massively. The open access surgery was great especially with sick children however although it's now a different system in place to get seen or have an appointment it does work well. It's a great surgery and the staff have been accomodating, supportive and non judgemental, especially around weight issues. Having the dispensary is a real bonus rather than having to travel to get medication after an appointment.  Very sad to hear that one of the doctors is leaving, they are great."
Bildeston,Have been a patient since 1997,7/15/2015,5,"Particularly good service as surgery is open to all patients without an appointment 5 days a week, by appt. saturdays."
Bildeston,Helpful on the phone,8/18/2021,4,"Very helpful on the phone when you call and the triage system has worked well, although my husband was given antibiotics for something that wasn't an infection. At the end of the treatment when nothing had improved he was offered a face to face appointment with the doctor and a true diagnosis was given, its important to be able to get to see someone as phone consultations don't suit every situation. Using econsult where I uploaded a photo and was given an appointment was very good and easy to do. I like that you are told when the doctor will be calling (AM or PM) so at least you know where you stand. The treatment and care given is always very good."
Bildeston,Helpful staff,3/14/2019,4,"It's ok, there are long waits to be seen in the morning session and it's got harder to get an afternoon appointment too. Staff are helpful and medical staff explain things well. They're on the ball and referrals to the hospital work well. I didn't know that hearing aid batteries were available from the surgery and this means I don't have to go to the hospital for them now."
Bildeston,Helpful staff,8/22/2018,5,"Everyone at the surgery is friendly and helpful. Everything is done efficiently and well and I really like the morning surgery session, it works well. You know where you are in the queue with the number system and if you want an appointment you can go in the afternoon, although it can be a bit of a wait to be seen or get an appointment as they are busy. It would be nice to have new content showing on the TV screen. Its also good that many community services are available from the surgery which mean you don't have to travel to the hospital."
Bildeston,I cannot fault the service provided,2/19/2016,5,"I cannot fault the service provided at the Health Centre from first contact with the reception staff, the doctors and the pharmacy staff. Having the sit and wait service in the mornings and the appointments in the afternoon means I have never had to wait to see someone when I have been ill."
Bildeston,I can't see a female doctor today,11/19/2019,3,"The Car park is a bit small for the size of surgery. I cannot see a female doctor today which I am a bit upset about. I would like to see a second female GP here.I still do like the walk in aspect of this surgery, that really is a big positive for it."
Bildeston,I have always had good service.,6/1/2016,4,I really appreciate the open surgery they have each mornming - if I feel unwell overnight or in the morning I know I can just go along and if I need a non urgent appointment I know I can book in advance to see the GP I prefer to see.
Bildeston,I have to validate the need to be seen,3/4/2023,2,"I have found there to be more of a barrier to get in to see the doctor these days. My husband had a heart attack a year ago and I do now feel vulnerable and insecure, I now have a fear that there will not be good care available quickly to me or my husband when needed. My husband had to be sent to Papworth from the hospital as an emergency, but just feel that things could have been picked up quicker if we did not have to wait so long beforehand. I just feel that we have to validate the need before we can be seen face to face."
Bildeston,I like it that you take a number and wait,11/19/2019,5,"I like the walk in aspect of this surgery, you take a number and wait. I do find the dispensary here a little disorganised, they are not always sure where they have put my medication and sometimes it is not made up when I collect."
Bildeston,I really like the open surgery,10/17/2016,5,"The system works really well with the open surgery+ appointment system.  I really like the open surgery which is a big advantage.
Very good at getting medication in that was not available"
Bildeston,I really like the system,10/17/2016,5,I really like the queue system which is in place. Very approachable staff and a good mix of female and male doctors.  Nursing staff are very good.
Bildeston,Important to see same GP,12/23/2022,4,Today's appointment was a pre booked appointment following an earlier appointment and I'm seeing the same GP again which is great. I feel it is important with some issues to see the same person again. I've been very happy with the care and support provided by the surgery.
Bildeston,Impressed with service given by the doctors,11/19/2019,5,"I am impressed with the service given by the doctors. You can choose the doctor that you want to see and I like the morning as I call it ""free for all"" service. The staff are so helpful. I never feel rushed. Car park is a bit small."
Bildeston,Incredibly impressed,8/18/2021,5,"Since moving to this surgery we've been incredibly impressed with every contact from reception through to the doctors, they've all been great. We struggled at our last practice to get issues addressed but here it has been a totally different experience, they've been so helpful and have really treated us holistically, especially my husbands many conditions. It's the small things they do that make such a difference, I asked for some information and the doctor printed it off straight away for me."
Bildeston,It's a good surgery,3/14/2019,5,"I'm confident that I will be seen whenever I need to be seen. If you can't see your own GP you can always see someone else. Having both the open morning session and the afternoon appointments works really well and I like that  can get blood tests and pickup medication from the surgery. Referrals to the hospital are done quickly and staff are great . Doctors always call you back when they say they will and reception staff are friendly and helpful when speaking with them. The system in place works so well, Ive been at other surgeries and this is so much better."
Bildeston,Keep it as it is and don't change anything,11/19/2019,5,"They are very good here, its the service and the professionalism of the GP's. Keep it as it is and don't change anything. I do like the walk in morning service even if you have to wait a bit."
Bildeston,Kind friendly and efficient.,10/17/2016,5,"Kind, friendly and efficient surgery.  I like the queue + wait system and really like that the doctor will call you back quickly if you are worried about something.  To book a specific appointment with a doctor can mean a two week wait"
Bildeston,Like the appointment system,3/14/2019,5,"It's a perfect surgery, everything works really well. I like that you know where you are I the queue once you've been given an appointment, I like the process in place it is very good"
Bildeston,Like the continuity,3/14/2019,5,"It's good to know that you can come any day and will always get an appointment. I really like the continuity and get to see the same doctor each time. Staff are good at communicating and explaining issues, very helpful. The system in place works well and I generally only use the morning sessions. Getting other types of appointment is the same and it's really clear when you will be next with the numbers used."
Bildeston,Like the morning sessions,12/19/2018,5,I like that the morning session enables you to see someone when you need to. I rarely come but when I do its the morning sessions that I go to. Having blood tests is easy enough  you just need to wait your turn to be seen. The system in place works very well and the staff are helpful and accommodating. Medical staff explain things well and you get to see the same doctor most of the time which is good.
Bildeston,Like the morning sessions,12/19/2018,5,I really like the drop in sessions where you are sure to be seen and the surgery is very friendly and you are actually known by staff rather than just being a patient. It would be good if the list of doctors working that day could be put back on reception desk so that you can choose who to see before being asked. Staff are good at explaining things and helpful when dealing with you.  There are only two disabled parking bays which does make it difficult for me and I often have to arrive extra early just to get a space.
Bildeston,Like the open surgery sessions,8/22/2018,4,"Its a good surgery, staff are polite and organised and I like the open surgery session in the morning, it works well and you are always seen."
Bildeston,Like the system in place,3/8/2018,5,A very good surgery which works well. I like the morning surgery sessions and appointments in the afternoon. Staff are all very good and so friendly
Bildeston,Lovely doctors and nurses here,6/4/2019,5,"Lovely doctors and nurses here. I like the fact that you don't have to make an appointment, you just turn up and wait. 
Repeat prescriptions all work well.
Very good, no issues at all."
Bildeston,Lovely staff,4/25/2022,5,The staff at the surgery are lovely. I've had a mix of appointments with the GPs and the nurses and they've always been great and addressed the issues. The person you see is the one most appropriate for the issue which works really well. The surgery and staff have been marvelous.
Bildeston,Lovely surgery,7/10/2023,5,"I phone the surgery to get appointments, they have mostly been phone conversations with the GP but this has worked well. I'd be confident that I'd be seen if it was needed. The staff are great and they have a lovely attitude, I really can't fault the surgery at all"
Bildeston,Morning open surgery is a big plus,11/19/2019,5,"Morning open surgery is a big plus for this surgery, we don't mind waiting. I like the fact that the surgery provide a GP list of who is due to be on duty on a specific day. Car park is a little small."
Bildeston,Morning walk in surgery,11/19/2019,5,"I like the walk in morning surgery, it works very well for me, no changes please."
Bildeston,Mostly see the nurse,9/14/2022,5,Mostly I see the nurse and that on the whole works very well. Occasionally it would be better and more appropriate to have face to face appointments with ongoing asthma issues. Staff are good and apart from that nothing else needs to change.
Bildeston,No concerns,4/12/2015,4,I have gone there since I was a baby and I have never gone anywhere else so I have nothing to compare it to but there is a mini library and many doctors with different roles so a lot is covered.
Bildeston,No problems at all,9/14/2022,4,It's a very good surgery. I call for appointments and can get seen when it's needed. The staff are very friendly and approachable and there are no problems at all.
Bildeston,No problems at all,8/18/2021,5,There are no problems at all with the surgery. The triage system works well and you get to see a doctor when needed. The reception staff are helpful too.
Bildeston,No problems getting appointments,12/23/2022,5,I spoke to reception this morning and arranged an appointment with a doctor following a course of antibiotics as they wanted to see me again. I've had good contact with the surgery and feel that its a great surgery with amazing staff.
Bildeston,Nothing is too much trouble,12/19/2018,5,"I like that you can just walk in and be seen. Nothing is too much trouble for the reception staff, they've been great. Medical staff are very good , they've been incredibly supportive."
Bildeston,Nurse is lovely,11/26/2021,5,"I find that it is all fine at the surgery and nothing needs to change as it all works so well. The nurse I see is lovely, really great and explains things well. I come for regular blood checks and don't have any issues getting the appointments."
Bildeston,Nurses are brilliant,12/23/2022,5,"I called this morning explained the situation, then spoke to a GP and was then invited in for an appointment which was really quick. The practice is lacking a GP which probably makes things more difficult for them. I do like the continuity we've had in the past, it's not so easy now as doctors have left. The nurses here are brilliant, very friendly and put you at ease.  The doctor did a very quick referral to hospital and I've been very pleased with the surgery."
Bildeston,OK,11/12/2015,3,I went to speak to my GP about a problem let me talk and listened well. However I could have been given more info on what to do about it as they was very brief about what I can do to help it and didn't say anything about how to prevent it happening again
Bildeston,On the day system is good,6/4/2019,4,"I do like the number system where you just turn up on the day, but you do have to wait for a while.
I wish the carpark had more spaces."
Bildeston,On the day system works for me,6/4/2019,4,I like the fact that I can come on the day and wait without an appointment. I wonder if medication reviews could be done over the phone instead of coming in?
Bildeston,Open access to my regular doctor is excellent,3/17/2020,5,"Surgery and pharmacy are supportive, helpful and friendly. It is much appreciated"
Bildeston,Open morning session good,8/22/2018,5,Having the open morning session is very good and works well. I tend to visit in the morning as you can see the GP of your choice. All staff are friendly and attentive.
Bildeston,Open session doesn't work for me,8/22/2018,2,The open session in the morning doesn't really work for me as you have to wait so long. You're in a queue but you're given an appointment when its busy. When you have to visit regularly you have a lot of waiting to do. There's some lack of organisation. I recently had an appointment which needed a follow up blood test but no one was available so I had to have yet another appointment on another day rather than just doing it there and then.
Bildeston,Open surgery very good,3/14/2019,5,"The open surgery is very good, to get appointments in the afternoon can take a bit of time but mornings allow you to be seen as and when needed. Staff are absolutely fine,I've never had any issues. Staff explain things well and call backs are a great option too"
Bildeston,Part of the community,6/4/2019,5,"This surgery is part of the community, and the system works - if you're prepared to wait you can always be seen on the day.
This really is a good service."
Bildeston,Pay more attention to patient's opinions,10/31/2017,4,When experiencing difficulties with a family member staff often don't listen to the family who have seen small but definite changes.  Conditions then progress until it is evident to the professional.
Bildeston,Perfect,9/14/2022,5,Its an organised surgery with helpful and good doctors. There's nothing to worry about here and the dispensary is good.
Bildeston,Phone calls aren't my preferred option,9/14/2022,3,"I do feel that face to face appointments are more limited now and phone calls aren't my preferred option but at the moment the majority of my appointments are like this.  I have had issues with medication not being in stock but regular items haven't been a problem to get.  When I was eligible to have my covid booster vaccination I was out of the country, on my return the surgery were no longer doing them so I had to go elsewhere which was more inconvenient."
Bildeston,Phone consultations work well,4/25/2022,4,"I've had a phone consultation this morning and it's sorted out my medication issues and hopefully that will do the trick. The surgery is very good, I've mainly had phone consultations but would prefer more face to face appointments but everything has been addressed when I've called. Reception staff are always lovely and helpful, the only issue is that waiting outside for prescriptions can be quite cold."
Bildeston,Pleasantly surprised,12/23/2022,5,Pleasantly surprised how quickly I got a response from a doctor today. I spoke to them on the phone and then they invited me in for an appointment with them. Last time I contacted the surgery I was dealt with over the phone which was very good and doctors have explained issues very well.
Bildeston,Please consider social prescribing.,8/4/2016,4,Please consider social prescribing.
Bildeston,Prefer face to face appointments,9/14/2022,3,I find face to face appointments more personal as they can see you and how you really are. The phones are busy and I've been fourth or fifth in the queue and hung up due to the cost of staying on the line.  I do worry that the phone consultations will lead to things being missed or me being misdiagnosed.
Bildeston,Professional and Friendly,11/19/2019,5,I travel to this surgery from Hadleigh because I really like it. It is friendly and professional. I would like the option of a second female GP.
Bildeston,Put you at ease,3/14/2019,5,"Quite happy with things at the moment. Staff put you at ease and really explain things well. Generally I can get appointments whenever needed, sometimes the afternoon appointments are more difficult to get. The queue in the morning when you're trying to get in isn't very nice when it's raining but I can understand why the doors aren't opened earlier. I've never had any trouble with staff."
Bildeston,Quick referral,4/25/2022,5,I've had phone and face to face appointments with the doctors recently and was referred quickly to hospital. The doctor provided a good explanation about what was happening too. I did like the open surgery that used to be run each morning but although the system has changed it has worked well.
Bildeston,Really are fantastic,11/19/2019,5,"8.30-10.30 am is open surgery and is very good. We are very lucky here, you can also ask to see a specific doctor, they are very flexible. I really can't knock them they really are fantastic. Could do with an extra doctor. Car park could be a bit bigger."
Bildeston,Really good service,3/21/2023,4,"This service has been very good for so many years. It is now become overrun, as we lost the 'on the day walk-in'. We do worry that the service will become less accessible. Staff are lovely and do there best."
Bildeston,Really good surgery,12/23/2022,4,Telephone calls and face to face appointments are available when they are needed and I've found the telephone calls have addressed the issues I've had and the doctor gets back to you quickly. Its a shame they've lost their female GP as there are times when I would prefer to see a female GP. I've not had to wait long on the phone and I've had fairly good continuity with the doctor I've been seeing.
Bildeston,Really great,11/26/2021,5,"The doctors and nurses are really great at the surgery and they do an amazing job. I do struggle a little with the change to the appointments system and would like to be able to see a doctor in the way we used to, which was much easier."
Bildeston,Really happy,4/25/2022,5,"The service provided is great, it all works well for me and I can get to speak to a GP whenever its needed."
Bildeston,Really like the surgery,8/23/2018,4,We really like the appointment system in place at the surgery it works really well. There are good doctors who you can see you relatively easily.
Bildeston,Saved my life on two occasions.,2/2/2021,5,"Surgery doctors and nurses gave me sound advice and check-ups following an out-of-hours 111 TIA trip to hospital followed on a later occasion when I was rushed to hospital FROM THE SURGERY when its nurse practitioner discovered a 70/45 blood pressure reading, triggering the onset of sepsis revealed when my cellulitis-infected right leg swelled ankle to groin while awaiting the ambulance."
Bildeston,See doctor of choice,8/22/2018,5,You do have to wait in the mornings but you will get to see the doctor of your choice. I prefer the morning session but for appointments it can be a bit of a wait to get one.  Staff are always good and you generally get enough time spent with the doctor.
Bildeston,Seen quickly,8/22/2018,5,"You can be seen quickly on the day which I like and having the appointments,which are quieter, available in the afternoon really works well too. The car park is a bit small but I understand that there is limited space available. Mental health support is a little hit and miss at times, they don't always understand how bad it can be."
Bildeston,"Small car park, excellent service",6/4/2019,5,"The surgery uses a number system where you site and wait and you are seen on the day. 
The car park is a bit small, otherwise this is an excellent service."
Bildeston,So caring,11/26/2021,5,"I have a long term condition and following surgery I had complication. Knowing the surgery was open I visited and my GP stopped what they were doing to help me, amazing. Many others would probably have turned me away but they are so caring."
Bildeston,Staff are great,4/25/2022,4,"I've not had a face to face appointment with a GP for sometime and have been put off calling due to the procedures in place and the need to go through a triage process. In the past the staff have been great, I just need to get used to the new system."
Bildeston,Staff are great,8/18/2021,4,The change to the appointment system from an open surgery to a triage system is different but I've had phone consultations and sent pictures in and this has worked really well. Having said that I would still like to see a return to an open surgery as it was so great to have. Staff are caring and supportive and have been great over the last year.
Bildeston,Staff are great,3/14/2019,5,"We can walk in and wait out turn to be seen which is very important and I've never been unable to be seen on the day.  The staff are great, they offer alternatives and are flexible with what's available. A bigger car park would be lovely but realise it can't expand."
Bildeston,Staff are helpful and appointments work well,8/30/2018,4,I like the way you can turn up between 8:30 to 10:30 and wait to see a GP and set appointments in the afternoon. A concern is that with extra housing the surgery would struggle. The car park is small and could do with being larger. Staff at the surgery are generally helpful. Do use the online system to order prescriptions and book afternoon appointments which works well.
Bildeston,Staff are really good,11/19/2019,4,I like the 'walk in' aspect of this surgery but it can take a while to wait to be seen. Staff are really good here. They have a good children's area in the waiting room.
Bildeston,Staff do a good job,11/26/2021,4,I've not needed to be seen much but I do collect my medication regularly and it all works well with them being ready on time. The staff are all good too and do a good job.
Bildeston,Staff good,11/26/2021,4,"The staff are good, caring and friendly but I would like to see a return to more face to face appointments and feel that there are times when I need to be seen."
Bildeston,Staff good,12/19/2018,5,"I really like the walk in system in the mornings as it allows you to be seen.  Reception staff are helpful and approachable and the attention from doctors is very good, they're not patronising at all. It would be nice to have a drinks machine as you can wait at times for the appointment but the walk in system in place is great and works very well."
Bildeston,Still all very good,12/19/2018,5,Having the walk-in session in the mornings works really well and means you don't have to book in advance. Generally it all works very well and staff are all very good. The car park is a bit limited and there have been occasions when medication isn't correct but normally its ok. Nothing significant needs to change.
Bildeston,Super 'turn up & wait' system.,2/21/2017,5,Really like the turn up and wait system between 8 and 10 am.  It works really well for me as a patient
Bildeston,Superb turn up and wait your turn system.,4/23/2017,5,Open surgery in mornings mean you can see a GP when you are ill not 7 - 14 days later like appointment only surgeries. Appointments are available for those with more important things than their health weekdays pm and Saturday am
Bildeston,System works well,3/14/2019,5,I like the fact you can just turn up and you will always be seen when needed. I'm happy to see any of the doctors at the surgery.the system in place works very well and I can get blood tests using the same system which is great.  I do use online system for prescriptions which is good too and medications are available when needed.
Bildeston,They do everything well,3/14/2019,5,"I always use the morning sessions and can see the same doctor and this is really important to me as they know me well. They do their best, a few more doctors would reduce waiting times but it works well. Staff are very good at explaining and engaging with you.  I'm very satisfied with the treatment we get and the people we see"
Bildeston,They listen,3/14/2019,4,They listen to you and are always very friendly. The appointment system works really well and you know that even if you have to wait you will be seen. There is pressure on the doctors but you can get other appointments if needed. I've had no problems with getting medications but it would be great to have toys for children to play with while they are waiting.
Bildeston,This is a good surgery,6/4/2019,4,"I like the site and wait service that this surgery offers, you then get seen on the day.
Never had any issues with the staff attitude.
This is a good surgery."
Bildeston,This Practice has Outstanding Access.,4/13/2020,5,"The GPs And Other Medical staff are caring, they listen and discuss options in a way you can understand. The Office Staff are also outstanding, approachable, cheerful and helpful"
Bildeston,Treated well,8/22/2018,5,"First class, I've always been treated well and have no complaints.Having the option of the open surgery session or the appointments works very well. Staff have always been brilliant, they're polite and helpful and sort things quickly. Doctors will ring you back when you need to speak to them. In winter it would be nice if the doors could be opened a bit earlier so you don't have to queue in the cold. It's important to have some toys for the children and the surgery is always spotlessly clean."
Bildeston,Triage has slowed things down,12/23/2022,4,The phones are busy so you do have to wait a while to get through and it does feel more of a drawn out process now compared to what it used to be but there are a lot more people trying to access the surgery than there used to be too. Care provided by staff is good its just the change to the way you get appointments thats changed.
Bildeston,Triage works well,4/25/2022,5,"Had a phone consultation with a GP today which has worked well and solved the issues, I'm just picking up the medication that has been prescribed. I've also had face to face appointments recently when they've been needed and it was absolutely superb, all the staff have been great."
Bildeston,Triage works well,4/25/2022,5,I called first thing and spoke to a GP a short while later so for me the triage process works really well as it has addressed the problem and I haven't needed to come in to the surgery for something unnecessary. I've seen the nurses in the past and they've been great too so I'm happy with how it all works.
Bildeston,Under the circumstances very good,9/14/2022,5,Whenever I've called the surgery I've had call backs quickly. It may not be how it used to be here but I'm confident that if I need to see someone I will be given an appointment. Medication is available promptly from the dispensary and they are all doing a great job.
Bildeston,Value the surgery,12/19/2018,5,"The friendliness of the doctors is very good. I don't visit very often and I've never been turned down for an appointment for being seen. It would be good if the morning session ran for a bit longer. Works well when I need an appointment and I really value the surgery, its popular and friendly."
Bildeston,Very caring and staff are very good,8/30/2018,5,"Really like the fact you can turn up and wait your turn to see a GP. Staff are very good, don't mind answering the receptionists' questions and doctors are great. A very caring surgery that has provided good mental health support."
Bildeston,Very consistent,10/17/2016,5,Can't fault it.  It's 5 star.  Everything works really well and very consistent
Bildeston,Very flexible service.,6/4/2019,5,"I feel so lucky to have a walk-in surgery. It's a very flexible service. 
Car park is a bit small though."
Bildeston,Very good,12/23/2022,4,Call backs are quick and when promised. I've been seen for an urgent issue today and they've been very accommodating with staff squeezing me in. All the staff are great. The only slight issue is that the privacy in reception isn't great as you can hear everything being said and you are asked why you need the appointment. As most appointments are now booked by phone rather than at reception it's probably not such an issue but I was very aware that people could hear everything I was saying.
Bildeston,Very good,9/13/2022,4,I called the surgery this morning and was called back by a doctor with in a few hours. The majority of my issues have been addressed with phone consultations which is great. Staff are very friendly and happy to help. The only thing that could be improved is an increase in the availability of face to face appointments.
Bildeston,Very good,4/12/2015,4,It was very good and quite quick.
Bildeston,Very good surgery,8/18/2021,5,Generally very good and can get my prescriptions when needed. I've used the triage system and was given a phone consultation which worked well with a call back in the afternoon that addressed the issue.
Bildeston,Very happy with reception,12/19/2022,4,"Appointments are available whenever needed and the phone is answered quickly, very happy with reception. The nurse consultations on the phone I've had have been good and have addressed the issues well."
Bildeston,Very helpful and supportive practice,1/20/2022,5,"I was quite unwell in July and the GP I spoke to was really kind, supportive.  Reception staff were responsive and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. They made me feel that I wasn't a bother."
Bildeston,Very well managed surgery,6/23/2020,5,"Having living in a number of areas of East Anglia, both Essex and Suffolk, over the year, this is certainly the best surgery I've ever used.  Good access, helpful and polite staff, good facilities for parking and an on site pharmacy."
Bildeston,Walk in system works for me,6/4/2019,4,"Walk in system here, I am happy to wait until we get seen.
No concerns"
Bildeston,Walk-in and wait works well,6/4/2019,4,I am quite happy with this surgery and I like the GP and I get on with the staff. I like the number system where you walk-in and wait.
Bildeston,Walk-in appointments are good,6/4/2019,5,I particularly like the walk-in aspect of this surgery. The doctors seem to stay for a long time at this surgery which is good for patient continuity. I do wonder if the pharmacy could be a bit more organised at times of collecting repeat prescriptions.
Bildeston,walk-in waiting appointments work well,6/4/2019,5,"Friendly, comfortable ad often see friends to talk to whilst I'n waiting. 
I never make an appointment, I come and wait and it works well for me.
I would change nothing at all, we are very lucky to have this surgery."
Bildeston,We have a very good surgery here,6/4/2019,5,"Have had an excellent referral to the hospital to expedite an operation on my hip. 
I find the staff very obliging.
The idea of taking a number and sitting and waiting is a very good system. 
We have a very good surgery here."
Bildeston,We have the consistency of the same GP,11/19/2019,4,"I like the drop in aspect of the service here, you do have to wait about 2 1/2 weeks if you want to book an appointment. You can get the consistency of the same GP which is good. The dispensary might like to consider going a little more commercial to make a bit of extra money."
Bildeston,Will be seen on the day,8/22/2018,5,"You don't have to wait as you will get to see someone on the day. I tend to use the morning sessions more but do have afternoon appointments too. Staff are really good, they are polite and listen to you and give you time. I do try to see the same GP."
Bildeston,Wonderful,9/14/2022,5,"Considering the situation the surgery manage everything very well. The staff are all nice and caring and I like the phone consultations with the GP as it means you don't have to come to the surgery when its not necessary, which for us is quite often. Actual appointments with a GP face to face are avaialble when they are needed so it all works well."
Bildeston,Working very well,8/18/2021,5,A bit more parking would be nice but generally the surgery is working very well with the changes to getting appointments that have been introduced. You can still get appointments when they are needed.
Bildeston,Working well,8/18/2021,4,Generally everything has been working well for me with the triage process but I would like a return to the open surgery we used to have as I believe it is a better system but can understand it's not possible at the moment. I would've liked health checks to continue through the pandemic as I feel my husband who has family history would have benefited. I've managed to get all my prescriptions when needed and the system in place works well and means you don't have to go inside the building.
Bildeston,"Working well, staff great",4/25/2022,5,"I've had phone calls with my GP which have addressed the issues and following blood tests I was referred to hospital and told to go straight to A&E. The face to face appointments I've had work really well and my GP is amazing, I really can't fault the surgery."
Bildeston,Would like more face to face appointments,11/26/2021,4,"I do feel that not all things can be diagnosed over the phone and it would nice to be able to see a doctor more easily but I understand at the moment things are difficult. Whenever I've had a phone consultation I've just been given medication, it does feel like they're just not interested."
Bildeston,You can sit and wait during the morning,11/19/2019,4,I like the fact that you can sit and wait during the morning to see a doctor. I would appreciate a home visit when needed.
Bildeston,You can't fault it here,11/19/2019,5,"I like the walk in aspect of the surgery. You can't fault it here, I have had experience of another surgery in Suffolk and this is far better. The dispensary is also very good here."
Bildeston,You will see a doctor,12/19/2018,5,"The main thing is that you can walk in in the morning and see a doctor, you may have to wait but that's not a problem. I try to use the morning sessions, most of the time you can see the same doctor which is good but I'm happy to see the others when they're not available. Staff are very polite, helpful and friendly which is also good."
Birches,1 GP runs 1-2 hours late,8/3/2019,3,"As one particular Doctor is quite slow but because they are so caring, he runs 1-2 hours behind most times.  Today it is already an hour.  I expect it, but it can get annoying if you have to be somewhere as you have to get there and check in on time knowing you will wait for at least an hour."
Birches,2 weeks to process a presription,8/3/2019,3,"Prescription that came from the hospital on discharge takes 'up to 2 weeks' to process.  This is not putting the patient first.  They have a piece of paper about it on the receptionist desk, that is how they communicate this to people. It states that the hospital should provide 14 days of medication if urgent.
The surgeries care is excellent but the prescription 'protocol' is my only grievance.  
HWS CDO was able to confirm that this is the situation and that any medication should be supplied by the hospital if it is required immediately."
Birches,30 mins behind,11/13/2019,3,"Yes I got an appointment, but it is now more than 30 minutes behind.  If you know when you come in the realistic waiting time, you can relax and not be constantly on the hop.  Surely there is a way of communicating this.  It would make a difference."
Birches,35 mins behind today,12/11/2019,4,"It is difficult to book appointments, but we got one today.  The GP we are seeing is very behind (35 mins so far), and the HWS CDO explained that the locums can fall a little behind as they may not be as familiar with a patient.  So this explains it, which is good to know, but also highlights an issue. Kids get unsettled and bored waiting this long."
Birches,4 Star,7/10/2015,4,4 Star
Birches,40 mins late,10/1/2020,5,"Although today my appointment is 40 minutes behind, which is stressing me out, I know when I see my GP the initial annoyance will be gone as they are very kind and caring."
Birches,5 star,9/16/2015,5,Long wait. Never feel satisfied.
Birches,6 week wait,6/14/2016,1,To get an appointment is diabolical! to see my doctor I have had to wait 6 weeks for a routine appointment.  Not good enough
Birches,Access to GP for medication,10/28/2021,4,I am pleased to be able to see the GP today for a medication adjustment that is needed. Personally with many different conditions I feel this is good as I would not be happy to talk about these drugs with someone who does not know me so well and what does and does not work for me. I am pleased that the issue is being resolved.
Birches,Accessed other site,2/11/2022,4,"My smear test was due. I requested it sooner rather than later, as had an abnormal one previously and had been referred to the hospital for further investigations (none needed).  I put in a request on AskMyGP and had an email initially back.
Unfortunately, Kesgrave Nurse crew were unable to comply due to Covid and/or other sickness. I was telephoned by Martlesham and if I could get there I would have my smear (and my peace of mind). Although a slight delay, procedure and result were ok (Thanks NHS). However, I could do this only because I had a car and no dependents (i.e. Children) to care for.

I am also the parent of an adult with special needs. I have found the surgery have always treated this individual with kindness and understanding that another individual has to be with him. Not the easiest thing to do when there is a small room and Covid is rampant to keep 2 m apart and masks on. Bless you all."
Birches,All staff and Drs are extremely professional,5/17/2020,5,Always very helpful and go out their way
Birches,All staff and Drs are extremely professional,3/27/2020,5,Always very helpful and go out told there way
Birches,All the staff always ready to offer help,1/28/2020,5,We are extremely lucky to live within the area they cover
Birches,Always a long wait,6/9/2016,4,"Always a long wait for your appointment.  Last week was an hour.  The GPs are all very good, explain everything well."
Birches,Always been able to get a reply within an hour,1/2/2022,4,On Line is a lot easier than ringing and being put in a queue. Easier to check email when out too to see reply.
Birches,Always cheerful and helpful,10/4/2020,5,Always had good experience with receptionist nurses and doctors
Birches,Always chronically behind schedule,4/10/2021,1,"I’ve twice had to leave the surgery without being seen, despite booking early appointments (8:30 & 9:30), and having waited between 25 and 45 minutes past my appointment time. I fail to understand how the surgery can be so far behind schedule when the day’s only just begun. It’s hard enough to get an appointment in the first place, and taking time out of a busy day only for it to prove pointless is frustrating and inconvenient."
Birches,Always get the care I need,8/12/2021,5,"I have always been able to get an appointment if I have need to be seen by a clinician. GPs and nurses are professional and friendly, so are the practice team. I feel you all get bad press but you all do a fantastic job.
I have just used ask my gp for the first time. I got the advice I needed without having to see a GP all within a couple of hours. Thank you to everyone at athe Birches"
Birches,Any old GP,2/11/2022,3,After I called the surgery I had a call back the next day by a GP who does not know me. They just give you any old GP and it just does not help you or them as things do not get sorted. They did not resolve things on a phone call. I wish to see my named GP who knows me.
Birches,Appointments feedback,12/11/2019,4,It is not easy to get a non-urgent appointment.  You have to normally ring up on the day for an emergency appointment which is usually at an inconvenient time.  I would rather book a week or month in advance.
Birches,Ask my GP is a brilliant service.,1/2/2022,5,"So much easier than trying to get a face to face appointment. I work full time so struggle to get a time to attend appointments. It is quick, responses all on the same day. Prescriptions sent straight to pharmacy and ready to collect almost instantly."
Birches,Ask My gp is very easy to use,1/2/2022,5,The Birches has always been a good surgery for me I have no complaints
Birches,Ask my gp used to arrange blood tests,1/2/2022,3,"Nurse practitioner fabulous as always, polite, experienced and helpful, receptionist as unhelpful as ever and incorrect information put on app by receptionist which caused wasted gp time taking a call they didn’t need to take, gp also very helpful !"
Birches,Askmygp was not working,8/12/2021,2,"First time I simply wanted staples removing after operation, a quick response but the person didn’t understand what a staple or a stitch was. Resolved once someone from surgery rang.

Yesterday had a query re medication - still waiting."
Birches,AskMyGP working well,1/2/2022,4,AskMyGP seems to be good initiative and should be continued. It might be helping surgery reduce in person appointments while benefitting patients to be able to reach GP and not rely on availability of appointments and repeatedly  try  calling at 8am till receptionist is reached. There was a problem on uploading photo to AskMyGP while raising a request and GP did not receive it. Please fix this.
Birches,Average,2/11/2022,3,"I only use the telephone, but they try to get you to use online, which is also switched off! The last time I called I got a ring back the next day by a GP who then got me in face to face too, but still not resolved things. No follow up offered. It feels you are palmed off."
Birches,"Awful, Stressful",10/27/2015,2,"Unable to book appointment in advance. Have to call at 8am and they do not listen to what I say, just want to get rid of me. Always running late even first thing in the morning. I can never see a doctor."
Birches,Behind a lot today,10/1/2020,3,"I just find it very frustrating how far behind they run.  My GP is always the same, it is nice that he spends time with many patients, but I work, and when I see him I make sure I do not take up more than allocated time, as I am rushing to get back out to get to work.  It is always the same and just feel it is not right."
Birches,Better communication for lateness,11/13/2019,3,In today with our baby who is unsettled.  We did not get called until more than 40 minutes past our time! No one tells you how behind they are otherwise we could have took them out to try and settle them on a little walk in the pram
Birches,Busy waiting room,12/11/2019,3,"-Busy waiting room (more than usual)
- Could do with a paint
- Hard to get through on the 'phone
- Waiting 30 mins past appointment time
- Impossible to see same Doctor"
Birches,Called back promptly,11/13/2019,3,"Haven't had any issues getting appointment, Nurse called back promptly and we were seen that day.  Would be useful to know procedure for making appointments as this has changed since last appointment and I was not aware."
Birches,Can never see my actual Doctor,8/12/2021,1,I now haven't seen my doctor who knows me and my needs for well over 3 years due to the fact you can't book advance appointments with the doctors. The my gp app also just says that the practice doe not support online appointments.
Birches,Cannot hear 'beep',10/28/2021,3,The sign to say you are being called by the GP has a 'beep'. I have a hearing loss and if I am not staring at the banner the whole time I will not hear the beep.  The GP came out to get me and said to reception 'is the board working?' This shows that the GP is not aware of my hearing loss and it made me feel bad that they had said that. The surgery needs to be more aware that people with hearing loss.
Birches,Cannot pre-book,5/28/2016,2,"Cannot pre-book appointments for non urgent consultations. Receptionist just gives me the same answer: no appointments today, phone back tomorrow at 8.00 am"
Birches,Diabetic reviews don't get flagged up,6/27/2023,4,Reception staff are ok on the whole there are a couple of them that can be a bit 'scratchy'. I have not been asked for a medication review in a while and it should be due. I am diabetic and but my review doesnt get flagged up automatically. I have to ask them which is not great I feel.
Birches,Did not get help,8/12/2021,1,"I wrote to them that I needed a visit because I lost my voice, that my throat hurts and I bought everything they recommended to me at the pharmacy, and it didn't work anyway.  I got the answer ""wait 2 weeks and if it doesn't work, come back to us"".  so I call them and I hear from the lady at the reception that if it bothers me that I don't have a voice, I can take sick at work???? So I said I needed medication and she said she wouldn't help me any more.  seriously?  Who needs such advice????"
Birches,Difficult getting appointments,7/12/2018,3,It is very difficult getting appointments. Feel another surgery is needed with so many houses going up. They cover a large patch here and it is already extremely difficult to get an appointment.
Birches,Dr prescribed new prescription but not refill old meds,9/14/2020,1,Patient must attend surgery. Dr gave new RX (morphine); said continue codeine but didn't renew codeine Rx.
Birches,Easier to get appointment,12/11/2019,4,Waiting ages past appointment time today.  Everyone though is lovely and it definitely is easier to get an appointment now.
Birches,Efficient,2/11/2022,4,After putting in an AskMyGP I had a call back on the same day by a Nurse who was able to resolve things over the telephone. I like the system and find it very efficient as I always get a prompt response.
Birches,Elderly parents are very stressed,8/12/2021,1,Elderly parents are very stressed about having to use this system and have been told there is not an alternative. Considering we have an aging population how can this be right. Services in the public sector should offer many levels of access to suit the needs of the users
Birches,excellent,9/14/2017,5,GPs v good.  They really explain and are helpful
Birches,excellent,3/16/2016,5,"This a very caring surgery, never afraid to get you a second opinion and doctors never rush you,  They listen to every detail"
Birches,Excellent Care,11/14/2018,5,"During the afternoon of 26 October my wife who has long term disabilities began to feel extremely unwell.I contacted the surgery and explained to the receptionist the situation.  She phoned back later to say that the duty doctor would see my wife at 5PM.  On arrival we were told that the duty doctor had been called out to an emergency.  He returned after 6PM, and gave my wife a very thorough examination, lasting nearly an hour, during which time he dealt with at least one other emergency by phone.  He arranged for my wife to be admitted to hospital immediately, where she remained for over 2 weeks,  Whilst we were waiting for the doctor the reception staff did all they could to make us comfortable.  The moral of this story is that if you really need to see a doctor and explain the circumstances you will be seen and when we complain about the difficulty in getting appointments, as I have on occasions we should appreciate the enormous pressure they are under but when we really need them they are there.  I have not named anyone, but they will know who they are and they have our gratitude."
Birches,Excellent experience: Cervical Smear Test,9/11/2020,5,"Who would ever think that a cervical smear test can be a pain-free and dignified experience? Not me - until today! Thank you nurse, for really brightening up my day with your excellent care and professionalism!"
Birches,Excellent looking after me,10/1/2020,5,"Excellent service, looking after me through a difficult time with my health.  Do not see the same GP, but they all know what is going on with me and that gives me great confidence in the service.  I got a call from them to say I needed to come in and see them and so that is why I am here today. They are in good communication with the hospital, as I have blood tests there every couple of weeks."
Birches,Excellent Nurses and GP's,12/11/2019,5,Overall the Doctors and Nurses working here are excellent.  Unfortunately it is so hard sometimes to get an appointment which is frustrating.
Birches,Excellent response,1/2/2022,5,"My 2 year old son struggles with his chest and regularly ends up in hospital. After the most recent episode, I used ask my GP. I said what I thought was the problem and why I was concerned. We were seen within 45 minutes, listened too and given required medication. I then arranged a follow up appointment through the app and was given an appointment with the same person(KG), which helped to talk through the experience, understand and ease my concerns over future episodes. Both times the response times were minutes not hours. 
I'd also like to say that in the 11 years of using The Birches, I, and my children (incluidng midwives) received good care when I've needed it. Thank you."
Birches,Excellent service,5/16/2019,5,Excellent service. Get good ongoing care here. Staff are lovely all round.
Birches,Excellent surgery,10/1/2020,4,"Apart from initially trying to get through on the telephone first thing, I find the surgery excellent.  the particular GP we had when my husband was unwell and eventually died, was amazing.  He called us in the evening to see how we were doing.  Very caring and 'going above and beyond' in my book."
Birches,"Excellent, very efficient",1/2/2022,5,Got an appointment same day and calling frantically at 8am to never get through
Birches,Felt like I was an inconvenience,5/4/2022,2,"Was treated as though the staff member had other things to do and I was in the way.
Booking in system wasn't working, so when finally booked in by reception, was 'late', although was in the building in plenty of time."
Birches,Fine with appointments,8/12/2017,5,I never have a problem getting an appointment for this surgery.
Birches,Frequent refusal to make appointments,11/29/2019,2,My diabetes review is over six months overdue. My wife who had a serious accident a few days ago has just been refused an appointment and the receptionist did not even take her name. The service is simply appalling.
Birches,Getting through on telephone,10/28/2021,4,"If you don't call bang on 8am you have no chance of getting through. It can take constant calling for 2 hours sometimes.  I have seen the paramedic today and they were able to sort my issue out, so that was good.  I do not use the service very often, but works ok when I have needed it (other than phones being an issue)."
Birches,Good,12/1/2017,4,Waited for appointment due to collapsed patient therefore acceptable and understandable
Birches,good,7/3/2019,4,The overall care provided is good but getting an appointment with a doctor is very difficult.  Phoning at 8.30 only to be told all appointments are gone
Birches,Good continuity,10/3/2016,4,I get to see the same doctor all the time for non emergency appointments which is good but you do have to wait some time to see them. They have advised me to visit A&E today as they do not have xray facilities.
Birches,Good support,5/16/2019,5,Seeing my GO weekly at the moment and they are really good at making sure I see the same person. They give me a slip to give to the receptionist who then make the appointment. 'on the day' appointments are more difficult to obtain and it's 'pot luck' who you get to see. But that us the nature of how it is.
Birches,Good.,12/3/2016,2,"Rang between 8:00 and 8:30 to get an appointment the same day. When you need to see a doctor, you need to see one. Given an appointment at 10:45. Saw Dr (very nice) and was referred for a spinal X-ray. Suggested I go to hospital to have it the same day which I did.

Appointment was at 10:45 but had half an hour to wait (saw him at 11:15) but he gave me his time . i wasn't rushed and feel very satisfied. He gave me his time."
Birches,Got see someone,2/11/2022,4,"After a phone call into the surgery I did get an appointment a week later with the Nurse practitioner, who was very pleasant and kind. They are doing their best, and I understand the calls take a while to answer as they do not have a lot of staff answering when demand is likely to be high"
Birches,GP runs 1/2-1 hour late,10/1/2020,4,"Although my GP runs 1/2-1 hour behind all the time, I do not mind as he gives me as much time as is needed for him to be thorough.  He is very popular because of this.  Feel there are not many left like him.  We all wait longer, but feel it is worth it for the good care, it gives you confidence that nothing has been missed."
Birches,Great care and compassion,6/10/2021,5,I have always received the care and understanding at this practice. It is very hard to get through on the telephone but when you do if you need an appointment urgent on the day I have always got an appointment.
Birches,Great nurses and midwife,8/12/2021,4,"Have only had positive interactions with the nurses and midwife. While it is difficult to get appointments on the phone, the online service works very well and I have received a phone call or appointment within 24hours on both occasions. Great if you are able to use this service as it should free up phones for those who cannot"
Birches,Had no problems getting an appointment,1/2/2022,4,Had a phone call regarding an appointment and also text and the nurse was very pleasant
Birches,Hard with working,8/3/2019,4,"Overall the surgery is good.  You are however, never seen on time and you can never book ahead of time as always have to book 'on the day' which is hard with work unless you need to see a nurse."
Birches,Hearing loss makes ring back hard,10/28/2021,3,"Getting through on the telephone is difficult, but can speak briefly about the issue and they offer a ringback.  This is difficult, especially if someone has an accent too.  I have hearing loss, and trying to hear all the detail on the telephone is very difficult.It would work better for me to be offered a face to face talk as I do not use video call either.as I am now elderly."
Birches,I have had a great experience with one doctor,3/23/2021,1,"I have had a great experience with one doctor but unfortunately a bad experience with another. I went back for a 2nd opinion after seeing the first doctor that I was unhappy with. I was not spoken to in a nice manner at all, given no indication as to what the problem was or how to fix it. Luckily I asked for a consultation with a specific doctor that I knew and respected and had a better experience.
Telephone lines are ridiculous. Who has 40 mins in the morning to spend trying to get through? With no option of being put in a queue so you can at least put phone on speaker and get on with work. 
I’m also unhappy about the way my daughter has been treated recently.
I’m a receptionist myself, elsewhere, and I wouldn’t dream of answering the phone in the same way as some of the receptionists at birches do."
Birches,I like to use askmyGP,6/27/2023,4,"I like to access appointments online by using askmyGP, its easy to use and I order my prescriptions online too. I would very rarely ring the surgery as they take such a long time to answer. Unfortunately the automatic door is not working at the moment and we struggle to get in if we are disabled in any way."
Birches,Impossible to get routine appointments,6/5/2016,4,Absolutely superb services from the GP. It is however impossible to get a routine appointment as you have to ring up on the day for routine stuff
Birches,Impossible to see a doctor,5/28/2019,1,"Before I launch into this story I've been registered at this surgery for over a year. This is the first time (and last, as I'm going to change doctors after all this) I've actually tried to see a doctor there. 


Tried to call for an appointment, no answer, so I called 111 who confirmed that I needed to see a doctor but also could not also not get the Birches to answer the phone. 
Because of this 111 sent me to a&e, despite the fact it was not a medical emergency, but that it was the only way to get me to see a doctor. 

A&E triage did manage to get Birches to pick up and they said if I called at 12 someone would see me. It was something that needed checking out...just not a&e life threatening..

Because no one has been able to raise them all day I wasnt going to risk calling and no one answering the phone so I went into the surgery at 12 instead. 

No one there knew about the conversation with Ipswich hospital. When it was clear I wasnt going to go away they said that they did remember the conversation but they'd not guaranteed an appointment (they had) they had just said I could call up and try and the a&e doctor was okay with that.  
The receptionist then went on a rant about how I should have called (so she could have ignored me over the phone) rather than coming in (because it's harder telling someone there is no appointments to their face). 

She then went away and spoke to the duty doctor and managed to fit me at the end of the day. 

I appreciate that conditions may get triaged, but I dont expect this to happen when both Ipswich Hospital and 111 service have asked for an appointment.  
I also dont think that simply not answering the phone is an acceptable way of reducing patient load."
Birches,inhumane reception staff,7/3/2019,2,"Whilst I was waiting for an a appointment, a parent came into the surgery with her child who had shut his hand in the car door. Parent and child were in distress.
Reception staff would not allow them to see the nurse, which is all the parent wanted to do but she was not from the area.
I found that so unempathetic.
They told her that the hospital was easy to find then tried to direct her, but because she was so distressed she struggled to listen.
I believe that the nurses or doctors would have seen the child if they'd known."
Birches,KO- Get to see the GP,10/28/2021,5,"Only been here since lockdown and moved into the area. I have seen the GP 4 times in this time as have ongoing conditions.
Only issue has ever been trying to get through on the telephone in the morning, but they do always ensure I see the GP.  I have had to keep on top of my 'checks' as I currently am unsure if they are on top of these since my transfer.
(recommended they have a quick talk with GP that day about that)."
Birches,KO-Online good but limited,10/1/2020,4,"I find getting an appointment using the online system is good, but limited.  It can take a couple of weeks to get one for ongoing 'non-emergency' issue.  'On the day' I find really good if I need to see someone, which is rare."
Birches,Like that you can book in advance again,10/1/2020,4,"Alway found things in general, very good here.  With non-emergency appointments available again it works much better for me.  I never knew before how long to wait before a 'non-emergency' needed for me to call 'on the day' as I always felt this was for those considered more urgent, so you felt you were almost lying as after a couple of weeks it then does become more urgent.  So as I said, prefer it that it is now mixed availability of advanced too."
Birches,Little to fault,10/28/2021,4,"There is little to fault here really. GP's I try and see are great, but recently seeing another we are not used to, both my partner and I were spoke to with little information and there was an insinuation of dementia expressed, that was a bit shocking as we were there about something else and came away with little info a bit shellshocked!
(signposted to Dementia Together)"
Birches,Made 21 calls after 8 am and before 8.10,5/16/2019,1,See above
Birches,"Mainly good, when I can get to see someone",6/5/2016,4,I just find it difficult to get an appointment for myself. However getting an appointment for my child is fine. English is not my first language but I always feel they try their best to help me understand.
Birches,Missed appointments,8/3/2019,3,"Makes me annoyed when I see all the appointments that were missed last month (69) yet when I rang 3 days on the trot I couldn't get an appointment.  Things are running a bit behind today but that is unusual.  The surgery is part of a wider system that is broken, so cannot blame them."
Birches,Mix of staff,6/6/2017,4,"I find that the doctors are lovely here but the receptionists need to be more cheerful and welcoming in a 'forward facing' role, that yes is challenging, but that is not excuse for rudeness"
Birches,Mixed Messages and Procedures constantly changing,12/15/2021,1,"Once again my prescription hasn't been forwarded to the pharmacy even though advised by Dr that it would be there immediately.  Procedures constantly changing. Told last week that I needed a printed form to take for blood test, this week all done electronically.  Told by Receptionist to call on the day at 8am to get an appointment. Week later when I make the call, advised I have to log onto MyGP.  They really need to communicate with each other."
Birches,Much better run now,12/11/2019,5,I have been under this surgery since it opened. It is much better run now and have nothing but praise for the service.  Good communication between all the other services I use and the surgery
Birches,Multiple trips to get Rx and Xray results,9/14/2020,1,"Made at least four phone calls and submitted Rx request on system on line and made two trips to surgery to get Rx and x-rays. Told they would be ready. Rx=yes, X-rays=No.

Been trying to get x-rays since late August. 
Told they would be ready early 9 after 4:30PM. 
Got there after 5PM but not ready. 
Got a print out of result at 5:30PM. Got already known results on paper--was then told surgery doesn't receive x-rays. 
Why not in this digital world?
Should have been told this days earlier. 
Wasted trip"
Birches,My observation of reception,11/13/2019,3,"I am a patient here today and wish to comment on my observations of your reception team.
1.  Someone was at reception asking for help to complete a form to prove identity. 2 staff were very 'matter of fact' stating 'we don't do that here'.  They did ask upstairs to try and help, but quite a 'cold' reception.
2. Someone else came to pick up a letter that he said 'should have been ready last Friday', it wasn't. No apology. 'When will I know it's ready?' response was 'We'll ring you', again emotionless. 
In both situations you could feel the frustration for the patients.

My appointment is 30 minutes behind already."
Birches,My wife had a head to toe examination,1/2/2019,5,A good experience with a preliminary correct diagnosis prior to several hospital test and consultant appointment.  Reassured by diagnosis.
Birches,New system is excellent,3/12/2021,5,I have used the AskMyGP system three times this week and have got an appointment today. Before this system was introduced I would be trying to ring in and getting more and more frustrated. I cannot recommend this enough as it quick and easy.
Birches,"No info, just a call",10/28/2021,4,"Seeing the GP today after getting a call that they need to see me 'one-to-one'.  I've recently had scans, so not sure if about that as they didn't say anything.  Just left me feeling worried."
Birches,No more face to face medication reviews,6/27/2023,3,"I go down to the surgery to make my appointments face to face so that bit is usually ok. I am diabetic but I don't know the last time I had a diabetic check. They no longer seem to be doing face to face medication reviews which seems concerning to me, they do it over the phone instead. I no longer get the consistency of seeing the same person anymore, it just does not happen. The automatic door into the surgery is no longer working and it is a real problem for people as it is not easy to open."
Birches,No response when calling and Staff not helpful.,9/12/2021,2,"My 92 year old friend after finally getting through to speak to someone, was advised to book her appointment online!"
Birches,No-one answers the phone,4/22/2021,3,"In April, I had a call from the surgery but no-one was there. I had a phone message to call the surgery. It took 23 minutes for someone to answer and then I was made to feel awkward as I didn't want to go to the hospital for a blood test. I am disabled and the walk to the pathology department at Ipswich hospital is a long, and, for me, a painful walk."
Birches,Not able to get appointment,3/12/2021,2,"I walked in today as this online system is complicated for us and we cannot get through on the telephone either. it is frustrating.  The receptionist did deal with it in the end after telling me I needed to go online and try sort it out, which just is not working for me as husband has been ill for 4 days."
Birches,Not able to get appointments when needed.,2/21/2017,1,Not able to get appointments when needed and when you discuss it with reception they become rude.
Birches,Not efficient or best use of systems,3/2/2022,3,"Elderly relative is patient they have twice received calls from the surgery informing them they need a telephone appt with GP but have then been told the person calling cannot book and they must use the ‘ask my GP’ service to do this.  When they submit the request they wait days for a response whilst worrying what the call is needed for. 
Appreciate surgery needs to use new technologies to help with patient numbers but to call a patient to say you need an appointment but refuse to book it at the same time is absolute madness."
Birches,Not reading letter properly,4/25/2018,3,"It took 4 phone calls for the surgery to finally admit that they had a letter from another clinic. I knew they had it as I had a copy.
I had an appointment about the recommendations in the letter. The Dr however didn't read the letter properly and so I had to make another appointment to clear the who matter up!
Other than this occasion I have found the surgery very good and the staff are quite excellent."
Birches,Not really listened to,12/17/2015,4,I feel that my GP makes very quick judgements about me and doesn't really listen to what I'm saying. You are better off as a patient if you know the system.
Birches,Not see who I expected,8/3/2019,2,I have turned up to see one nurse and when they came to get me it was someone different.  I do not like that.  I have anxiety and prefer to know who it is I am seeing and they not change it.
Birches,Nurse is the best!,1/2/2022,5,Just to say I recently had a smear test that I was extremely anxious about but my nurse as always put me at ease and was absolutely lovely. She looked after me after my C-Section and has given all 3 of my children their vaccinations and just makes everyone feel more relaxed at appointments. So thank you to my Nurse you are a star.
Birches,Nursing staff provide an excellent service.,7/31/2019,3,"Recently I had a routine annual hypertension review with the Practice Nurse. She was very good in dealing with the task in hand. We have developed a good relationship over time. I mentioned my recent visit to the hospital when my medication was changed and my care was transferred back to my GP. The new dose was not helping the condition. Practice Nurse looked at the national guidance which suggested a higher dose for men. I was given a new prescription to comply with national guidance and she made a routine appointment with the GP who had referred me to hospital so that my medication  is reviewed in 9.
 This was a good example of joined up care plan, saving time for the practice and time and anxiety for me.l"
Birches,Offered GP+,8/3/2019,3,"Difficult sometimes to access but last time I had an issue that needed attention, they did offer me an appointment with GP+ in Felixstowe on a Saturday, which was excellent"
Birches,ongoing access,2/11/2022,5,"I use the online system and I get a response within a week, which is ok, but it does say you will hear usually the same day. Recently I did have a face to face appointment with a GP, not mine, but ok as this is an ongoing situation that is being monitored. I have seen same person a couple of times, so that helps."
Birches,Online system works well for us,3/12/2021,5,"I registered to use the AskMyGP system, put the request in and on the same day had a response and appointment. For us it works extremely well and will continue to use it"
Birches,Outstanding,6/16/2020,5,Never have a problem seeing a Doctor or Healthcare professional.  I have received nothing but exceptional care from all members of staff.  Thank you.
Birches,Overall a good surgery,12/11/2019,4,"Overall a good surgery, however there is always delays which I know sometimes can't be helped.  Sometimes you can smell whatever food the doctors had before in their office."
Birches,Overall ok,8/3/2019,4,Things could run a bit smoother if it was not so difficult to book an appointment and if things ran a bit nearer to 'on time'.
Birches,Phone frequently left unanswered.,7/12/2020,1,Tried to phone. 5 minute lecture on COVID and then phone answered. Website is a mess. No practice manager  shown or ways of getting in touch with him/her. Parts of website don’t work and take you round in circles.
Birches,Phone system often frustrating,5/16/2019,4,"Can be frustrating getting through sometimes and 1 or 2 of the reception team are a bit abrupt, however some are lovely. We have been given a GP+ appointment when all the appointments in surgery are gone, so that's good."
Birches,Poor,9/30/2019,1,I have never had so many issues with my prescription in my whole 41 years and of being a type 1 diabetic
Birches,Poor,9/30/2019,1,"I wouldn't take my cat to this place!  There was an accident and the ambulance was going to take an hour, so I put the injured person in my car and popped to the surgery and they wouldn't help!"
Birches,Poor,9/30/2019,2,Nearly impossible to get appointment.  Never see same GP. Unhelpful receptionist.  Telephone conversations overheard by all in waiting room
Birches,Positive experience,1/2/2022,5,Ask My GP is Good not to keep trying to call
Birches,Prescribers very helpful,12/11/2019,5,Reception staff are not all helpful accept (4 x names removed) who are brilliant.  Doctors and Nurses usually very helpful too
Birches,Prescription review,12/10/2022,1,"Trying to arrange my prescription review. On a new medication for my Blood pressure, and I have asked 3 times to have it added to my regular prescription 'repeat.'
On the phone 3/4 hour and attended the surgery to request it, and was told it had been referred to the pharmacist. What does that even mean?!! It has not made a difference! Just feels they are passing the buck or just not communicating it, if this is the process."
Birches,"Professional, kind, gentle and reassuring",8/21/2020,5,Nurse was so kind and professional. I was a very nervous patient and the nurse made me feel at ease straight away. Huge thanks to her.
Birches,Queue number,12/10/2022,3,"When I ring up for an appointment, I would like the call acknowledged so that I know I am being processed. At the moment the phone just rings and you think that no one is answering. Other surgeries do have a system where you know where you are in the queue."
Birches,Rang this week,6/18/2016,3,I rang this week (commencing 13th 6) and I couldn't get a routine appointment until 28 July!!!!!
Birches,Really great experience,8/12/2021,5,I was so surprised to get a reply so quickly and have my issue discussed and then I was booked in for my appointment for this Thursday. Honestly it was such a refreshing change and I reccomend those to use this 'on line system' that can instead of ringing up. Hopefully this method will put less strain on the receptionists!
Birches,Reception staff can be rude.,11/2/2021,1,"Yet again, when asking for help with an appointment to change a dressing, no help was offered, just a blank refusal. Politely done but no help at all."
Birches,Reception staff can be rude.,5/2/2021,3,"When visiting a doctors' practice, one should feel supported but that often doesn't happen. Doctors and nurse are wonderful but  SOME of the reception staff are downright rude. Others are definitely helpful. Patients are usually stressed and worried but can be made to feel like a nuisance."
Birches,Receptionist (not all) are so rude.,7/11/2019,1,There are so many it would turn into an essay! I’ve been let down by your surgery so many times. The doctors most probably don’t have a clue what goes on.
Birches,"Receptionist, in particular one, very rude.",9/5/2019,2,"Most receptionists are nice but one in particular is very rude, no time to listen and straight to the point. Most of the time interrupts you to get to the point. Wait time also is not good. Doctors have mostly been okay and take the time to listen to your problem"
Birches,receptionists very rude,5/21/2019,1,However the Doctors and Nurses are outstanding when you do manage to see them
Birches,Resolved same day,2/11/2022,3,"Wait quite a while to get through on the telephone and they offered me an appointment the same day, which was good as I saw a GP, and have done so a few times. You are unable to see the same GP though which means you are not confident and need to explain everything"
Birches,Response is fast,1/2/2022,5,I have used this service a couple of times and had a fast response by phone or email and also been able to get a face to face appointment when necessary.
Birches,"Routine appointments work well, staff lovely",5/16/2019,4,"Getting an 'on the day' appointment is difficult,but with routine appointments I get contacted and it works really well. The staff are all lovely."
Birches,Rude Receptionists,7/4/2019,3,"Staff are rude, expect you to know what they’re talking about when using acronyms & different words to explain appointments. Some GPs run incredibly late sometimes as their patients clearly need to see them but hey don’t have enough time to see them, be better giving 20min appointments & having less on the list to see instead of constantly running late - sometimes an hour or more. Frustrating when you’re fitting it into your day or have to go back to work. GP+ system I would highly recommend as slots made available in the middle of the day & easy to get an appointment. Never needed to wait more than 5 mins when for me or my son."
Birches,Rude receptionists,1/4/2019,1,"The receptionists are rude, you can wait up to 2 hours to see the doctor!"
Birches,Seen when needed,8/3/2019,5,"Always been seen when needed appointment.  Get prescriptions in timely manner.
The GP I see is popular and always run behind time.  You get 30 minutes with him if it is needed, so it is expected."
Birches,So much to say,2/11/2022,1,"It's a zero service, as feels 'service' is non-existent here.
Initially I emailed with a Nurse responding, and from that I had to call on behalf of my partner following heart by-pass as the email was unsatisfactory. They were unable to get out of bed. They said they could not talk to me and so I said they can ring back and speak to them instead, though finding it difficult. This is bizarre as I am next of kin etc! Anyway, DR 1 rang and asked if they could come into the surgery. I had already told them that they could not get out of bed/stand up! DR1 said he would arrange a nurse to call the next day to take blood sample. between 11-3. No Nurse came! At 3:30 DR 2 rang and asked same questions as last one, and got some answers from us. Upon explaining that we were waiting for a Nurse the DR decided to come round the house. Such a rigmarole, they could have done this in first place!

Also, after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes there has been no further medical help. Their blood sugar levels were high when Papworth did tests in 9.
You just feel there is no service and you have to chase everything which is exhausting."
Birches,Some fantastic staff here,8/12/2021,4,Receptionists manner has slightly improved. The new ask my GP system seems to be great and efficient. This I'm sure will free up the phone for people who need to ring in. It also allows people who work to access a GP in some sort of way which has always been my biggest problem.
Birches,Sometimes difficult to see a GP,5/16/2019,4,"Difficult to see a GP. Keep seeing a nurse practitioner, although they are able to deal with our needs our preference would be for a GP consultation. We have regular blood tests but sometimes we are asked to go the hospital, but the hospital say we shouldn't be going there!? Our mobility is limited so we do prefer to come to the surgery, we do know they're recruiting a 'bloods' nurse, so that should help."
Birches,Staff are good,2/11/2022,5,"The last time I used the service I had a pharmacist call me who was able to assist me well. I find the staff all very helpful and kind here. The systems however let it down. They could benefit from an appointment portal/website. Not optimised for Web, so quite clunky."
Birches,Staff attitude could be better,7/16/2015,3,Staff could be less patronising
Birches,Staff variable,8/3/2019,3,"Staff attitude today was good, but there is a certain person who is not in today that is very very rude.  Waiting times are very long, in excess of 1 hour most times.  The care given by the doctors is excellent when you do get to see them.. Also you have to travel to the other side of town as they do not do blood tests at the surgery"
Birches,Staff very helpful and polite,12/11/2019,5,"Sometimes I can forget a regular appointment I need, but when I call they always find me another one in a short space of time"
Birches,Struggle to get seen,3/8/2022,2,"Mum's surgery is so different to my own. She struggles to get seen face to face and little notice is taken of the information provided through Ask My GP. I realise they have lost GPs so there are a lot of locums, but the difficulties for patients to access and actually see a GP are big. I don't get why they don't advertise their own vacancies on the practice website."
Birches,The booking system is extremely stressful,3/18/2021,2,"The only option available is to call at 8am in the morning to make a same day appointment. After redialling multiple times you might be lucky enough to eventually get through to someone, and then be even more lucky to find out there are appointments left. Currently (due to covid), the next option is to await a call from the Nurse Practioner which you are told could be at any time of the day, and if you miss the call you miss out. The Nurse then decides whether you need to see a doctor and then you get an appointment. The doctors and nurses are great. The office staff are trying their best. Other surgeries offer other options such as booking an appointment on-line. They also offer a telephone consultation or a chance to ask a doctor a simple questions without a face to face appointment. When I fed back a problem I had making an on-line appointment to arrange a blood test, they listened but said they weren't sure if they could do anything about that."
Birches,The my GP experience is very poor,4/26/2022,1,"Multiple requests made to speak to GP, minimal effort from the surgery to offer a solution, very rigid in what is available. working full time  my shift pattern does not allow me to have my phone ready to talk to a GP when they choose."
Birches,The new Ask My GP service is great.,1/2/2022,5,I have twice used the Ask My GP service and it has worked brilliantly. Much better than calling up at 8am and queueing. The first time resulted in an email back and a direct referral to get a blood test. No paperwork needed!!. The 2nd time resulted in a phone call back and an appointment to see someone face to face the same day. Excellent service.
Birches,The new askmygp app is great.,1/2/2022,4,I have two disabled children and have to request many repeat prescriptions. The new askmygp service is so much quicker for me and you get a response really quickly. I used to spend so much time on the phone and now it’s so quick
Birches,The receptionists are rude and aunhelpful,4/26/2019,1,Rude and uninterested receptionist talk down to the elderly and treat them like they are useless and unworthy!
Birches,The surgery keeps cancelling appointments,2/21/2023,1,"Had an appointment in October for a smear, it got cancelled, made another one for November, got cancelled, made one for December got cancelled, made one for January got cancelled, made one for February that got cancelled."
Birches,They give Wrong advice at reception desk.,9/24/2020,1,"Very bad service at reception desk. They don't answer the phone. And if you are lucky to get someone to answer your call, she would give you the wrong advice. E.g. I was told that I am not entitled for a flu vaccine on the NHS, and she strongly argued with me. Until I gave her a link to NHS website which very clearly states that I am within the group who is entitled for a free flu vaccine. 

Similar problem happened with my wife a few weeks ago, she was given the wrong advice too."
Birches,Things better than they were,12/11/2019,4,"I think things are better than they were, and I can get an appointment more easily.  Good with the kids here too."
Birches,Too many patients,4/29/2016,4,Too many patients around area and too few doctors.
Birches,Totally hopeless. Inefficient practice.,9/14/2020,1,"Got 2 letters to change practice, last one said dumping her off list end of month. Yet some staff have said don't change yet. She been bedridden for 5 weeks except NHS appts. Tried to contact practice manager this AM; told to call back after 3PM. Constantly called and finally got through at 3:45. Manager gone home."
Birches,Unsatisfactory communication with reception,10/2/2021,3,Visited today. The nurse was fantastic. Returned home to find 4 messages on my voicemail made in the space of four minutes. Each one said who the message was from but no reason given for the call. Tried to phone but medical centre is closed????? Website shows it should be open. No way to leave a message. Ridiculous.
Birches,Usually fine.,2/19/2016,5,The Birches is usually fine and you can get an appointment the same day. Care and treatment is average. I once rang a couple of days after a flu jab when I felt poorly and was told the flu jab can't make you ill and wasn't offered any advice or an appointment. I was made to feel as if i was intruding on the GPs time. Very cold and heartless. Indifferent.
Birches,Variable,8/3/2019,4,Nurse waiting times normally good.  Unfortunately Dr waiting times are usually lengthy.  Reception staff are always helpful
Birches,Very caring nurses,6/20/2017,4,"Very caring nurses, the doctors will sit and listen to problems. Calling on the day does work if you are really ill but if you need a routine appointment you can't plan ahead and you feel that you are taking an appointment from someone who needs it more."
Birches,very clear,12/11/2019,3,40 minute wait past my appointment but very clear explanation by locum- unlike previous doctor who had me very confused- didn't know why he wanted to see me!
Birches,Very efficient,1/2/2022,5,Birches medical centre have always quickly and efficiently dealt with any problems I have had and made the relevant referrals. Ask My gp makes it easier when working to send a message and not have to sit on the phone waiting to get in the queue for appointments that day .
Birches,Very efficient,1/2/2022,5,Birches medical centre have always quickly and efficiently dealt with any problems I have had and made the relevant referrals. My gp makes it easier when working to send a message and not have to sit on the phone waiting to get in the queue for appointments that day .
Birches,Very fast responses every time I have used it,1/2/2022,4,Have used it once for myself and a couple of times for my son and always had very quick responses and appointment on the day if needed.
Birches,Very good here,10/1/2020,4,"Things are very good here. With my hearing loss I have to get someone else to call in on my behalf and they assist them fine so that I get what I need.
Today I am frustrated as my appointment is now 35 mins behind, and 10 mins ago reception said I was next. I just get agitated when I am on my own especially, so it does not help."
Birches,Very happy with the service,6/18/2015,5,"Overall very happy with the service, waiting for appointments can be an issue."
Birches,"Very quick, efficient and helpful.",1/2/2022,5,"On line service, I sent a brief description and photo at 7am, received a call by 9am and prescription sent to pharmacy that day. Very efficient and helpful, actually makes you want to go to the doctors instead of leaving problems."
Birches,Very satisfied with promptness of reply,1/2/2022,5,"Ask My GP - I received a reply to my query and was seen that afternoon. All dealt with, even though it was on a Friday in the pm"
Birches,Wait in all day,12/10/2022,3,"I phoned for a face to face appointment with the Doctor and was told I would receive a call back first. I stayed by the telephone all day and eventually received a call back at 5pm by a paramedic from the surgery, who was unaware that I had requested a face to face appointment. However, the very polite, pleasant person was very helpful. I was happy with the call and follow up."
Birches,Waiting could be less,11/13/2019,2,Staff could be more friendly and the waiting time could be less
Birches,Was quite good,7/15/2015,3,Was quite good.
Birches,Would like to see same GP,10/1/2020,4,"I would like to see the same GP with same opinion and experience that I trust, otherwise it can just get confusing for all.  Getting through on the telephone is difficult.  I have rung continually 40+ times, however today it was much quicker.  Staff are lovely, cannot fault them at all."
Botesdale,A good surgery,2/13/2023,4,Its a good surgery but the dispensary is more difficult.  I was 74th in the queue this week and spent nearly 40 mins waiting which is understandable because they are so busy. Reception are always good and todays appointment was prebooked following an earlier nurse appointment.  The nurses always provide good treatment and care.
Botesdale,A very good surgery,2/13/2023,5,"On the whole very happy with the surgery. I'm happy to see any of the staff, there is a small issue getting appointments at times but I do feel well supported and patients are at the fore front.  The nurse I've seen has been great and the care is patient centred."
Botesdale,Absolutely brilliant,2/3/2023,5,They do their very best and I've had no problems getting appointments when I've called the surgery. I do like to see the same doctor for ongoing issues but for other issues its not a problem at all to see any of the staff as they are brilliant and very cheerful.
Botesdale,Always pleased with service,6/8/2015,5,Short waiting time and although I had return to have a blood test it was the same day. To improve it would have been better if the blood samples could have been taken during the first consultation as I do live some distance from the surgery.
Botesdale,Amazing surgery,9/14/2022,5,I have an ongoing medical issue and when I've needed help through out covid and since the emergency care practitioner has gone above and beyond. The support provided has been great with the long covid issues I've had too.
Botesdale,Amazing surgery,9/14/2022,5,"Friendly staff, thorough doctors and the dispensary staff are great. It hasn't been great over winter having to wait in the rain to collect prescriptions, a covered area would be nice to have! The check in computer often doesn't work and isn't today."
Botesdale,Appointment with in an hour,3/10/2022,5,I've not used the surgery much recently but when I called on Friday I was offered an appointment with my own GP with in an hour. They explained everything and I'm happy that a follow up appointment has already been arranged too.
Botesdale,Brilliant,5/10/2022,5,Absolutely brilliant. Not needed appointments much but those I've had have been very good. Phone consultations have addressed the issues and staff explain things well.
Botesdale,Brilliant,5/10/2022,5,"Very happy with how easy it is to get appointments, its great and the staff and doctors are friendly and approachable."
Botesdale,Brilliant Surgery,2/3/2023,5,"I really can't fault them, they treat you as a person and not just a number. I feel well supported and listened to. Even when I've called later in the day they will always get one of the staff to call you back or see you. The paramedic here is very good and gives great advice. They do a great job and we're lucky to have them."
Botesdale,Brilliant surgery!,6/8/2018,5,I had pains in my chest and called for an appointment but I couldn't be seen that day. The person I spoke with advised me to call an ambulance but that seemed a bit dramatic so I thought I would try for an appointment tomorrow. A bit later my GP called to say he had reviewed my file and he told me he had called an ambulance for me! Fantastic care
Botesdale,Busy phones,2/13/2023,3,The busy phone lines do mean that at times you have to wait for a call back rather than getting an appointment straight away. I did speak to a doctor later in the day and it did address the problem. Waiting times are one area that could improve but other than that staff are all great.  Once you've seen a GP and are waiting for medication to be prescribed it can take a while and recently with a sick child we waited an hour only to be told it wasn't available and that I'd need to come back the next day.
Botesdale,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,The phones are busy and the service is over stretched but the care is fine when you do get to see someone.
Botesdale,Can't fault the surgery,6/7/2022,5,The children are seen immediately and I feel that the triage process is a real bonus as it means you don't have to come in for everything. The phones are busy  but I tend to use econsult to avoid them but you can't use it for the children and it would help if you could even if it was just for their prescriptions.
Botesdale,Care is good,9/27/2022,4,"I've always found the care good at the surgery over the years. The phones were particularly busy yesterday but I came down and got an advanced appointment, so happy with how it has worked and will get to see the GP now."
Botesdale,Care is good,4/21/2017,4,Concerned about the lack of consistency with doctors and ease of getting an appointment but the care is very good.
Botesdale,Care very good,6/7/2022,4,"The phones are particularly busy at the moment although the care provided by staff is very good. The dispensary often don't answer their phone as they are so busy but that means you then end up talking to reception, tying up them"
Botesdale,Caring atmosphere,9/11/2018,5,The overall service provided is very good. Getting an appointment has become more difficult but when you are seen they are very good. They create a very caring atmosphere at the surgery. Its also good that you can have X-rays at the surgery.
Botesdale,Caring staff,6/7/2022,5,The phone lines are busy in the morning but I'm flexible about who I'm happy to see so that makes it easier to see a doctor or nurse and appointments are always available. The staff explain issues well and they are caring. The booking in computer in the surgery never seems to work.
Botesdale,Caring surgery,1/8/2018,5,A very positive and caring surgery where you get to see a GP easily and having the extra facilities there is really useful.
Botesdale,Caring surgery,11/5/2018,5,A very caring and friendly surgery where you are known by your first name. Never have any problems getting appointments.
Botesdale,Couldn't be beaten,2/13/2023,5,There's no better surgery. I walk up to the surgery to book appointments and find this works really well. Its a proactive surgery that keeps me well informed with wonderful staff and is well run.  It's easy to get medication and they know you personally which is lovely.
Botesdale,de registered without notice,6/21/2016,3,The surgery de registered us without informing us. This then had consequences for us and caused problems
Botesdale,Delay to get a dossette box,5/10/2022,4,Trying to get through this morning took 3/4 hr but once through the receptionist gave me an appointment to see a doctor straight away. We need to arrange a dossette box for a family member but there is a long waiting list with 25 people already waiting for them.
Botesdale,Difficult to contact surgery,2/14/2023,3,It can be difficult to contact the surgery and I've had 40 minute waits on the phone but once through I've had a call back from a GP and then a face to face appointment with a paramedic.  When I tried to book an appointment ahead of time I was offered one in 4 weeks time and appointments outside of normal surgery hours are difficult to get as seem to only be available on the day which is frustrating and very difficult when I work so far away from the surgery and getting back for on the day appointments is a problem.  When I spoke to reception about the difficulties I was basically told this is the system in place.  I've tried to use econsult but I was told to contact the surgery direct.  Getting in is the issue not the care.
Botesdale,Difficult to get through in the morning,9/11/2018,3,Its easier to go to the surgery to get an appointment rather than try and get through on the phone. You can't always get an appointment when you need one and losing the pharmacy means you can't talk to them for advice any more.
Botesdale,Do not like on the day system,3/10/2022,3,I really do not like the on the day system in place at the surgery because you can't get appointments easily and then when there are non available you are asked to call back the next day sitting on the phone for a long time again.
Botesdale,Doctor is good and listens,9/11/2018,4,"It can be difficult to get through on the phone and there are lots of options to press which I don't like. It is sometimes easier to go to the surgery and talk to them. The staff at the surgery are good, I've never had a problem. I'm happy with the doctor I see, they take their time with you and really listen which is nice."
Botesdale,Don't like telling reception everything,6/7/2022,3,"Explaining to reception is very difficult and I don't see why they need to be told everything, I feel it creates a barrier to appointments."
Botesdale,Dr's are brilliant,6/7/2022,5,"The level of care provided by the doctors and nurses is brilliant, I really can't fault them. Mental health support is second to none but I can't understand why the pharmacy was closed for such a large village a few years ago."
Botesdale,Easy to get appointments,6/12/2023,4,A real family feel surgery where staff are great. I prefer the new queue system on the phone its much better and there is flexibility in the appointment system to get different types of appointments as and when needed. I have regular blood tests and get the results well.  The only area that could do with improving is the availability of parking which is difficult on the current site but they are putting up a shelter to help those waiting for prescriptions as the queue goes out the door.
Botesdale,Easy to get appointments,5/10/2022,5,Very lucky with the surgery. I phone for an appointment and get them when ever I need them. I'm happy to see whoever is avaiable too and its been really beneficial to have the Nurse Practitioner and the Emergency Care Practitioner. The staff are always so patient even when really busy.
Botesdale,Econsult works well,5/10/2022,5,"Any queries  are answered well. The phones are busy and it would help to have more people answering the phones and giving out early morning appointments. Econsult works well and addresses issues well. The nurses are great, professional and nice and caring aswell as being open to discussing or explaining issues.  A doctor was great recently when I forgot to take my medication on holiday with me and they arranged for my medication to be sent to a pharmacy near by, it was so helpful and I was very grateful.  I like having the TV screen in the waiting area and think it would be a great addition if more information about what nurses can support with could be added to the website."
Botesdale,Econsult works well,6/7/2022,4,The phones are busy but econsult works very well as an alternative and the care received at the surgery is very good. At time one member of the reception team can be a little less friendly but it's not all the time and it must be a difficult job. In my job we have these small amplifiers attached to our windows so when talking to people we can hear what they are saying and the same for them. This could be added to the windows at the surgery to help hear what receptionists are saying.
Botesdale,Efficient staff,6/27/2023,5,"I cannot fault them. I find the staff are efficient, front desk to the doctors and nurses, they all seem to be professional in the way they are. There seems to be a different appointment process to the way it used to be but at least you get to be seen even though there can be a 3 day wait. Its certainly better than where I used to live out of the county."
Botesdale,Excellent,5/10/2022,5,"It can run a bit behind, and you don't always know who you will be seeing, but the staff are all very good and so friendly, I really can't fault them.  Have had differing messages from staff about covid boosters taking place soon.  I was told it wasn't available but have heard reception booking and the nurse said it wasn't available yet."
Botesdale,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Been here since a bay and they are great
Botesdale,Excellent but getting a non emergency appointment can be hard.,4/18/2017,5,A very good surgery.  The only issue is getting through on the phone in the mornings and getting an appointment when not an emergency
Botesdale,Excellent care,3/28/2023,5,The team at the health centre are very caring.  They really take time with you. When i have needed urgent care for respiratory issues i have been seen & treated straight away. I feel very confident in the care given. Thank you!
Botesdale,Excellent care and very helpful and friendly.,4/18/2017,5,Very friendly and helpful and have time for you.  I had a blood test yesterday and everything went well  I have regular checks and it is all arranged well. When I hurt my foot I told the nurse what had happened.  She looked at it during my blood test appointment and then got the doctor to look at it; he suggested going to A & E as it might be broken.
Botesdale,Exceptionally good surgery.,4/18/2017,5,Exceptionally good surgery.  Great to have a previous partner back as a locum.  It's great to have the x-ray and scan facilities
Botesdale,Extra facilities are great,1/8/2018,5,Great surgery with extra facilities available for scans and xrays which is great. They know you well and are very caring staff.
Botesdale,fair,6/21/2016,3,Some staff v. rude.  Waiting time for appt. - up to 2 weeks Urgent apps available but only if you are dying
Botesdale,Friendly and caring,1/8/2018,5,Friendly and caring staff who go above and beyond. Appointments are easy to get and we have a good number of doctors available who are all good.
Botesdale,Front desk staff are pleasant,6/27/2023,5,Good surgery and front desk staff are nice and pleasant.
Botesdale,Generally very good,1/8/2018,4,"Generally a very good surgery, however, on one occasion when I called the surgery following my husbands hospital stay an appointment was made for a home visit which was later cancelled even though I was concerned about him."
Botesdale,Generally very good but cannot always see GP of choice.,4/18/2017,5,Very good generally but not always able to get to see the doctor of your choice and getting through on the 'phone in the morning is very difficult.  A queue system on the phone would be better.  The automated system is quite confusing;  there are lots of options and it can be frustrating.
Botesdale,Good doctors,8/17/2016,5,There are really good doctors and the extra facilities that are at the surgery are good to have. Particularly like that x-rays and ultra sound can be done at the surgery.
Botesdale,Good staff,2/13/2023,5,"There are no problems getting appointments, its all very good and works well. They are under a huge amount of pressure but staff are polite and apologetic when they can't help as quickly as they'd like and they do all they can to squeeze you in. They explain issues well and doctors and nurses are very helpful, kind and so understanding."
Botesdale,Great doctors,2/10/2018,5,"A very good surgery, the doctors are great and I get on very well with the GP I see. It's also very good that other services like x-rays are available at the surgery too, it cuts down on driving to other places for services."
Botesdale,Great idea to have a paramedic on staff,2/10/2018,5,"It's a great surgery and I really like the staff because they are friendly and approachable. You can always get an appointment when you need one and its great that they now have a paramedic on staff, a great idea."
Botesdale,Happy,5/10/2022,4,A bit of a queue for the dispensary but that's not a real issue. My medication review was done by a GP face to face and I've been happy with how it all works.
Botesdale,Happy with everything,6/7/2022,4,I either call or pop in to the surgery to book an appointment which work really well. The practice and staff are good and I'm really happy with everything as when I need to see someone I can or I can get advice over the phone.
Botesdale,Happy with phone or econsult,6/7/2022,5,"I'm happy to see any of the doctors,  I would prefer to see my own GP but all are great. Also happy to use either the phone or econsult to contact the surgery for appointments.  It's a brilliant surgery best I've ever been with and it is really great to have xray facilities."
Botesdale,Happy with the surgery,2/3/2023,5,"I came down to the surgery this morning to book an appointment as it is quicker and easier than calling and I've been given an appointment with a GP today. The staff are great, they explain things well and I'm very happy with the surgery. The phones are busy when calling the surgery but it's the same for everyone and other than that I've not had a problem."
Botesdale,It seems to work well for me,8/1/2019,5,"I do not use the NHS that much, but when I do, it seems to work well for me. I appreciate being told truthfully what is wrong and how to deal with it, being sent copies of letters between different professionals (in my case, West Suffolk and Addenbrooke's hospitals and of course the local health centre)."
Botesdale,Lack of continuity,3/10/2022,3,"It's been difficult during covid with a lack of continuity. I don't particularly like on the day access as it seems silly for non urgent issues that could be planned in advance making it easier for work, as a result the phones are very busy. When you do call on the day there are times when you're told to call back the next day as there are no appointments left for that day."
Botesdale,Long wait on the phone,6/7/2022,4,"Getting medication is all fine, they are always ready on time but the phone are incredibly busy. I was 27th in line and waited 3/4hr to speak to reception and when I did get through there were no appointments available which is difficult. I've been offered call backs by a doctor but not always and I just find the process a little difficult, although the care provided is good."
Botesdale,Long wait on the phone,6/7/2022,3,I've been 38 in the queue and waited an hour on the phone to speak to someone. I like the continuity with the doctors but it's not easy and can be very difficult if you're not online. My job doesn't allow me to call at the times the practice wants but I'm told that for non urgent issues that calling at those times is the only way to get an appointment.  I've complained in the past but feel that the response has been that you can always leave.
Botesdale,Loss of pharmacy is disappointing,9/11/2018,3,I feel that it has got worse recently and although the care is good the loss of the pharmacy is disappointing
Botesdale,Lovely doctor,2/13/2023,4,"I was 15th in the queue but it didn't take too long to get through. I spoke with reception and got an appointment with the practice nurse who was the right person to see. I also see a lovely doctor and I'm able to have a laugh with them and they are wonderful with the kids.  I have had to stand outside for an hour in the cold which was especially difficult with a poorly child, this time we're waiting inside."
Botesdale,Lovely doctors,9/11/2018,5,"Excellent, every one of the doctors is lovely. They really know me well and they are all very nice. Its a very homely surgery and this is important to me. They always give plenty of time to discuss things with them. I never have any problems getting prescriptions and it all works very well for me."
Botesdale,Lovely staff,6/7/2022,5,I've not had any issues getting the rare appointments I've needed. It's a lovely very good practice and the staff are great. I've not experienced any issues with my prescriptions either it all works very well.
Botesdale,Lovely staff,6/7/2022,5,The staff at the surgery are lovely and are very good with our young son. The doctor we saw was lovely and explained everything really well. The wait on the phone was quite long and I try to use econsult depending on the situation.
Botesdale,No appointments available at times,6/7/2022,4,The phones are busy and a times there are no appointments available and you are just told to call back tomorrow. When you do get in to see someone the care is good. Medication is generally ready when you need it and I like the text message you get when they are ready to pick up as it means you don't have to keep popping down to see if they are ready.
Botesdale,No complaints,5/10/2022,5,I don't need to visit much but have no issues getting my medication each month. I put the prescription in 1 week before I need them and that works well and there's no delay. No complaints at all with this practice.
Botesdale,No issues getting appointments,6/7/2022,5,"The phones are busy and I'd prefer to have another option to contact the surgery. The care is good, staff are helpful and great when you do see them. There are no issues getting appointments so it works well."
Botesdale,NOT ON NHS REPEAT PRESCRIPTION SERVICE!!!!!!!,4/3/2020,1,"I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE ONLY GP PRACTICE IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS NOT ON THE NHS REPEAT PRESCRIPTION SERVICE!!!!!!!
RURAL PRACTICES SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO DO THIS NOT THE LAST AND AT A TIME OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE."
Botesdale,Noticeably busy,6/7/2022,4,"The surgery is noticeably busy and getting through on the phone can take time but call backs with a GP or appointments are available which is good. The staff are very friendly and professional when you do see them. Queuing for the dispensary can take a while but that and the phones are really the only issues, the rest works well."
Botesdale,Phones busy,2/3/2023,4,Everything is fine at the surgery apart from the phone system that is very busy. I've been 50th in the queue and it took 40mins to get through but apart from that the care provided by staff at the surgery is good.
Botesdale,Phones busy,5/10/2022,5,The surgery is good. Getting through can be frustrating due to the time it takes to get through. I don't always get to see the same GP but the staff have been very understanding and accomodating for a family member who has a needle phobia.  We have found that hopsital consultants do not always tell GPs what they need to know.
Botesdale,Phones busy,3/10/2022,3,Busy phones and appointments are not always available. The responses by econsult have also been too generic so its not really addressed the issues.
Botesdale,Polite staff,5/10/2022,5,Happy to see any of the staff as they are all nice and polite. I tend to see the GPs most but whenever I need a blood test they are always available.
Botesdale,Prefer face to face appointments,9/14/2022,4,"The phones are busy but once you are through staff do arrange a call back with a doctor, but I would prefer a face to face appointment rather than a chat on the phone. I preferred the system how it was before covid rather than now."
Botesdale,Quick Referral,10/14/2015,5,"Having severe shoulder/arm/neck pain I went to see my Doctor at Botesdale Health Centre and was referred for physio at Hartismere, which only took 6 days.  I was treated appropriately and helpfully by both the Doctor and the Physio.  The whole experience couldn't have been better dealt with."
Botesdale,Really has improved,2/3/2023,5,"Whenever I've needed to see a doctor I've been able to get an appointment, it really has improved. GP's and nurses are excellent and the nurse I see for  my diabetes is wonderfully supportive.  The dispensary does sometimes send out text messages to say medication is ready to pick up but they are not always ready, with items missing or just not done. It would be good to know what to do when things are missing and know the different options available."
Botesdale,Reception helpful,2/3/2023,5,"I spent 10 minutes on the phone but when I got through the receptionist was very nice and helpful and arranged for me to have an appointment with the doctor within hours of first contacting them.  The doctor recently referred me quickly on to the hospital and I've found all staff good to deal with, it's a good practice."
Botesdale,Respectful staff,2/13/2023,5,Its been good so far. The staff are respectful and always do their best to get you in and seen. The phone today was busy but it didn't take long to get through and I was given an appointment with a GP by staff after speaking to them and explaining the issue. I don't feel that there is anything that needs to change and all staff I've had contact with have been lovely and explain issues well.
Botesdale,Rigid requirements,6/7/2022,3,"Mum moved to the practice and was told she needed to have photo identification to join the practice but she has no driving license or passport and when she raised this she was dismissed by the staff member. There must be other alternative options because lots of elderly don't have either of the requested documents.  The doctor at the surgery though has been very supportive of mental health issues. Some of the reception staff are not always so approachable around these issues, making it difficult when they are the first people you have to tell about the problems you have."
Botesdale,Running so far behind,2/13/2023,2,"The cost of calling the surgery due to the long waits on the phone are concerning. I arranged todays appointment but they are running so far behind that I may have to go, It's more diffcult as I've brought someone with me for a different appointment and they need to go.  I've been told I need the appointment to discuss test results. It's all a bit frustrating today."
Botesdale,Sorted quickly,5/10/2022,4,I had a phone consultation this morning and it has worked really well and everything has been sorted quickly. Phones are busy but today they weren't bad considering its a Monday.  Doing my prescriptions online works really well and econsult call backs are quick. The only issue is that I have a long term condition and I speak to different doctors so have to repeat my situation all the time.
Botesdale,Staff friendly and caring,1/8/2018,5,"A wonderful surgery, staff are friendly and caring and know me well. It's lovely to have such a friendly and approachable surgery."
Botesdale,Text message not received this month,6/7/2022,4,"I normally get a text message to say my medication is ready to pick up but this month it didn't happen for some reason, I was then told by staff not to rely on it but that's what you're meant to do so you don't come down before it's ready. I ended up running out of medication while I was waiting for the text. Other than prescriptions I don't really use the surgery much but when I do it works fine to get appointments."
Botesdale,They have always been brilliant,12/12/2018,5,"If I need an appointment I 'phone into reception. There is a triage system and it works very well, directed to right person service which may well not be my GP. My whole extended family is registered there. They (the practice) have always been brilliant, can't fault them at all. When my mum died a few years ago my doctor called me to check that I was doing ok-fantastic."
Botesdale,Triage worked well,6/7/2022,5,"I called first thing and had a call back from the doctor with in 10 minutes and then an appointment 2 hours later. The doctors and nurses are helpful and friendly and I find they really listen to what is being said, they do a wonderful job."
Botesdale,Triage works well,9/13/2022,5,"I like the triage process, it works well and I use a mix of econsult and phone to contact the surgery.  The support provided by the practice during a time of crisis has been very good and overall the staff are brilliant and I wouldn't change a thing. They provide care with respect and compassion.  I've had a blood test this morning and I haven't had any problems getting the appointments.  A covered waiting area outside would be a great addition especially for winter and queuing for medication. I do wonder whether one of the windows in the reception area could be opened up for patients to put prescriptions in to the dispensary rather than them having to go out of the building after an appointment and queuing to come back in again."
Botesdale,Vaccinations done well,3/10/2022,4,I've not needed appointments much. I waiting for a new date for a medication reveiw as its been postponed a couple of times so far. I submitted a weeks worth of BP readings and it would be nice to get an acknowledgement from the surgery that they have received them. Its a very busy surgery but does tend to work well. It would be better if patients were trusted to identify if they need to be seen as the impression at the moment is that GPs don't particularly want to see you when you speak to them.
Botesdale,Very busy,2/3/2023,4,"The doctors are good but very busy and I can't always get to see who I'd like when I need to.  I received a letter from a GP asking me to book an appointment with them but I've tried and have to do it on the day so it has been hard to get the appointment arranged. The dispensary  take a week now to get medication ready and I've had some issues with medicines not being available. The text message letting you know to pick them up works most of the time but I have arrived and they haven't been ready and waiting, staff do them straightaway when this has happened."
Botesdale,Very busy phones,3/10/2022,2,There appear to be very few people answering the phones in the mornings as it takes a long time to get through. The check in machine doesn't work very often and it would be nice if staff kept you informed of delays. I would like reception staff to stop what they are doing and check me in. I saw the HCA and they weren't sure about something so they called a nurse in which was good and the paramedic has time to go through things and aren't as rushed as the doctors.
Botesdale,Very good,2/14/2023,4,"I have a good rapport with staff and they are polite and listen to what the actual issues are. Whenever I've needed to be seen I've got an appointment quickly.  Recently I saw a GP on Monday and by Wednesday I had an appointment with a physio which was great. They were very good and explained the situation well and what the next steps were. I've been given exercises to do and I'm really happy with the outcome.  It would be great if xray appointments at the surgery were more than once a week as it did mean a two week wait to get them done.  I can't wait until the shelter goes up outside, it can be abit of a long cold wait at times but having the shelter will help.  It would be good if I didn't have to pick up dossett boxes on a weekly basis as coming to the surgery that often can be difficult."
Botesdale,Very good surgery,5/10/2022,4,"It's a very good surgery and doctors and staff are great, offering a quick and efficient service. The surgery does get very hot in summer and there are times when the text message about picking up medications doesn't always arrive."
Botesdale,Very good surgery,4/21/2017,5,The surgery is very good. The only concern I have is attending appointments and getting medication when I can't drive.
Botesdale,Very helpful staff,5/10/2022,4,It's a very good surgery and I'm finding it easier to get appointments just by talking to reception. Very helpful staff.
Botesdale,"Very poor - Had appt, cancelled on day after waiting wks",12/10/2016,1,"Receptionist called left message? 
Cancelling appointment with GP, today. 

My hubby and fulltime carer, Started coughing up blood, so I got him only appointment which was cancelled at 08:30hrs today by Medical Centre receptionist. 

Instead of being able to book appointment with treating physicians, he was quizzed and cajoled referred to receive call from staff member. 

Staff member did call not on houseline, as instructed is screened, as rejects ppi callers and the like. 
He failed to listen to my husband's concerns, unable to book appointments or resolve anything? So, he was confused why my husband was upset? Staff member, repeatedly suggested termination of call? 

Leaving us wondering where to get medical help needed, to prevent pneumonia or worse! 

As patient, following orders to report any changes to GP. Address skin growths as soon as possible? Yet, denied opportunity until divulged all details to NON-Medically trained admin staff. Who say ""No appointments"" 

Never faced any issues with Botesdale Medical Centre until this year, with new staff, striking junior dr's and arrogant desk staff. 

Anticipating retaliation or de registering our household."
Botesdale,Works for me,5/10/2022,4,I have no complaints as the surgery works well for me. I can get appointments when I need them and there are no delays getting my medication.
Botesdale,Would prefer better continuity,9/11/2018,3,"I don't like that you can't get advanced appointments for routine appointments, which allows you to plan a bit more. I prefer to have continuity with my doctor too which isn't always easy."
Brandon,3 weeks for an appointment.,2/21/2017,5,3 weeks for an appointment.
Brandon,A bit easier this week,8/18/2022,4,"There are long waits on the phone in the mornings but this week has been easier and I was only 4th in the queue. I've had a problem all week and don't think the medication is working so I called the surgery again, spoke to a doctor and they have arrnaged for me to come in, so it's all worked well."
Brandon,A bit frustrating,11/26/2021,3,Getting an appointment is difficult. I've had a phone consultation for children but feel that they haven't addressed the issues and we've needed to have further contact with the surgery. For me personally I'm completely happy with having a phone appointment and the care provided is good when you do get to see someone. It's just for the children that I feel its not always appropriate.
Brandon,A good surgery,11/26/2021,4,The surgery is good it's just a shame that I'm unable to get my ears syringed by the surgery any more but staff have explained the situation and I've been told where to go to get it done.
Brandon,Abusive,12/30/2020,1,Dr was abusive don't listen and don't explain. I can only describe the behaviour of the GP as bullying
Brandon,All very friendly,4/5/2018,5,I called at 8.00 this morning for an appointment for my young daughter and we are being seen the same morning! All the staff are friendly and explain things very well.
Brandon,All very good,8/17/2018,4,"I have been a patient for four years. All is very good apart from delay in being called in to appointment. Also, it can be hard to hear when your name is called when the waiting room is full (and noisy)."
Brandon,Appointment issues,6/10/2015,2,Can't get an appointment when needed.
Brandon,Appointment process is drawn out,8/18/2022,4,The process to get an appointment does seem unnecessarily drawn out now as you can't just call up and book an appointment.  I've felt brushed off by a doctor who made it clear that they were the one to diagnose even though I was suggesting it was a reoccurence of an issue. I also feel that notes from the hospital are not always well read by GPs and it has resulted in the wrong medication being prescribed. The nurses though are great and I see them regularly.
Brandon,Appointment system specific and sometimes long waits.,2/21/2017,4,You have to ring dead on 8 am and keep trying.If you miss that it starts again at 2 pm.  Oncw through I have always got an appointment on the day.  Routine appointment could be 3 weeks
Brandon,Approachable and good leadership,1/14/2021,3,A few issues to begin with but after speaking with the practice manager my mind was at ease . I have since recieved great treatment and found this practice does have great leadership and they will listen to your concerns
Brandon,Been very good,8/18/2022,5,"I feel they are coping very well under the circumstances. I can phone the surgery and get a call back, speak to the doctor and they then call me in to the surgery if needed. They've never let me down and I've had lots of issues and they've always been great, staff are always so nice. Getting appointments to see the nurse is always fine to do."
Brandon,better than it has been,11/4/2022,4,I feel that they have managed well throughout covid but it does seem easier now to get a face to face appointment with a doctor than it was. The triage system works ok but phones aren't easy for mum and she misses things that are said.
Brandon,Better these last few years,8/24/2018,4,It is so much better these last few years (than used to be the case). I can still be a little bit late being called in but nurses and doctors are all very professional and understanding
Brandon,Brilliant,8/25/2019,5,"They have been absolutely brilliant to me, they helped me so much several months ago when my mother in law had dementia. I would never have managed without their support."
Brandon,Brilliant Practice but delays to see female GP,3/13/2017,5,"There can be quite a delay if, for example, I need to see a lady doctor. Overall they are a brilliant practice"
Brandon,Brilliant with me,8/17/2018,4,The surgery have been brilliant with me and they were also brilliant with my late husband. Clinicians and reception staff are all brilliant. Staff are really caring-I got massive support when my husband died. I can be seen 9 time out of 10 on the day.
Brandon,Busy phones,12/14/2022,3,"The phones are very busy, I was 27th in the queue and spent 4 days trying to get through to get an appointment, I finally got one today.  I don't feel that face to face appointments are as freely available as they were."
Brandon,Care good when seen,11/26/2021,4,I've found it difficult to get my child seen face to face when I think it has been needed.  Once we've been seen the care and advice has been good but I did struggle.
Brandon,Changed my life!,2/28/2017,5,"I have been treated for anxiety and depression for many years. This has mostly consisted of my medications being upped when I was going through a tough patch. The increases in medication left me in a zombie like state for most of the time. A new doctor joined the practice and when I saw him for the first time he told me I was taking too many mess. And he arranged a referral to a psychiatrist who was very, very helpful. After this I was sent for sleep therapy and then for lessons about anxiety and my life is transformed!!! Much for the better."
Brandon,Choice over appointment type,12/14/2022,4,"It's been ok today I was 13th in the queue and it took about 15 mins to get through. I was given a choice of a phone call or face to face appointment and chose to see a doctor so its worked really well for me. I usually see different doctors as they are all good, the paramedic takes time with you and goes through things well. I feel that as restrictions have lifted things are easing and there is a return to choice of appointment style.  We have found it difficult to get home visits for our father and then staff speak to him and then have to repeat everything again to us as we're not there when they talk to him."
Brandon,Clinically very good,8/17/2018,4,"Clinically it is very good though I am often late being called in-40 mins. today. I do understand, it is because of demand. They try very hard and overall it is ok."
Brandon,Clinicians are now very good,8/17/2018,4,"It could be a bit easier to get a routine appointment and sometimes I am a bit late being called in BUT I think the clinicians are now very, very good."
Brandon,Coming here for many years,8/25/2019,5,I've been coming here for many years. Everyone I have found to be helpful and supportive. I have no issues with appointment making.
Brandon,Confidence in Doctors and nurses,11/26/2021,4,I do feel that some issues need to be seen as I've found that phone consultations are not addressing the problems I have. It's meant that I've had more need to contact the surgery than if I'd just been given a face to face appointment.
Brandon,Considerable waits to see doctor,3/13/2017,4,There can be considerable delay when I attend for an appointment
Brandon,Continuity is a difficulty and delays at appointments,3/13/2017,4,Continuity (seeing the same dr.) is a difficulty and there is more delay to see a named doctor and there are some I prefer not to see. Delay at appointments can also be issue.
Brandon,Delays in being seen on time and cannot get appointments,3/13/2017,5,There is often a delay in being seen on time at an appointment. Getting appointments is horrific-I have waited 2 weeks for a routine appointment.
Brandon,Didn’t even get to speak,1/18/2021,1,"Phone rang so quick and stopped less than one ring ,they left a message to say they would speak if phoned back before four ,so I did and was told they are busy callback tomorrow they were the ones that asked me too book n appointment in the first place"
Brandon,Difficult to get face to face appointment,12/14/2022,4,"I've struggled to get a face to face appointment with a doctor. It's just more difficult to get them as the preference is to deal with issues over the phone. Everything they do is very good its just that you can't see them easily, although today I have been asked to come in."
Brandon,Doctors are good but don't like any doctors,9/14/2017,5,Not keen on doctors generally.  Doctors are all good - it's just that I don't like any doctors
Brandon,Doctors are very thorough,5/30/2017,5,The Doctors are very thorough so I don't mind waiting
Brandon,Drs can overrun,5/30/2017,5,Sometimes I go in (to the consulting room) a few minutes after the appointment time due to Dr. overrun. I have to wait about 2 weeks for an appointment if I want to see my own doctor.
Brandon,Dr's seem to keep changing and hard to get appointments,3/17/2017,3,"All the very good doctors seem to have gone. I have had one experience of bad attitude, a clinician was very poor and I wouldn't go back to them. It would be good to get a routine appointment in under  weeks."
Brandon,Everything works pretty well,4/5/2018,4,They can run quite late which isn't always a problem for me (I have some flexibility) but could be for others. Otherwise everything works pretty well for me
Brandon,Excellent,11/26/2021,5,"The triage system works well and I've had both phone and face to face consultations and both have addressed the issues I had. Staff are happy and I'm pleased with the way the explain things, it works so well."
Brandon,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Been a patient since the 1960s .  All great
Brandon,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,top notch surgery.  My doctor is absolutely amazing.  She has pretty well saved me
Brandon,Excellent Care and Hard working Receptionists,10/5/2017,5,"I have been a patient at this surgery for many years, the doctors have always been good at explaining the steps in my treatment and medication. You sometimes have to wait a little longer than you would like for an appointment but as we are all aware this is a nationwide problem. The reception staff are always friendly and great you with a smile and go that extra mile to help you."
Brandon,Excellent care before & after heart surgery.,7/1/2021,5,Always received excellent care from doctors  nurses and staff. Doctor detected my heart condition and saved my life. They are brilliant .
Brandon,excellent doctors and staff,3/3/2021,5,"Everyone one there is always ready to listen to your problems and are very friendly, nothing is too much trouble."
Brandon,Face to face appointments difficult to get,4/13/2022,4,Even though we have letters from the hospital saying our child should be seen by his GP we have been unable to get an appointment. We were told to go to hospital for what turned out to be an ear infection and this would've been known if he'd been seen. The hospital were not happy that we had gone there for it.  More recently it has been easier to get a face to face and when you do see someone the care is good.  The My GP app works well as an alternative to contacting the surgery  but I find it hard to understand how we can see nurses easily but not a GP.
Brandon,"Fair. GP can be rude, receptionists very helpful",9/14/2017,3,"Receptionists are fine - very helpful.  My doctor can be rude.  Short tempered, lacks patience"
Brandon,Fairly good practice,12/14/2022,5,"For aappointments the surgery is ok and there are no particular issues but as a relatively new patient I've not been able to get my medication as they said they are looking at it. I've run out and still waiting for an explanation or for the medication to be allowed. It would be better if they explained the issues.  The nurse I've been seeing is great, really can't fault them."
Brandon,Feel they are excellent here,8/25/2019,4,If I want to see the same doctor I have to wait up to 4 weeks. I do feel that they are excellent here. Reception staff are very good. You do have to wait over 30 mins depending on the day.
Brandon,Friendly and helpful,12/14/2022,5,"I don't like that you rarely get to see a GP anymore however the telephone consultations do work and address the issues. The staff are very friendly, polite, understanding and helpful and I've been able to book INRs whenever they've been needed."
Brandon,Generally good.,8/25/2019,4,Getting an appointment if not urgent can be up to 3 weeks. Generally the surgery is good but the car park is small. We have locum doctors but would prefer more regular doctors. Could be sign up on how to operate water flow.
Brandon,Generally the staff are great but one GP is difficult,3/16/2017,4,Generally the staff are great with the exception of one GP whose attitude is a bit of a difficulty for me. Nurses are excellent at explaining everything but the doctors less so. The Practice seems less 'personal' than it used to.
Brandon,Get an appointment on the day,5/30/2017,5,It is usually 20 mins after my appointment time when I get in to see the doctor but I ring in and I can usually get an appointment on the day.
Brandon,Getting appointments ok,4/13/2022,4,I've been able to get blood tests easily and booked today's appointment a week ago. I've never had any long delays for them and have got other tests done quickly too. Although I speak English as second language and at times I find translation a bit difficult I have my family who can help.
Brandon,good,4/8/2020,4,some doctors seem like they don’t care. i personally recommend Dr (name removed).
Brandon,Good,8/25/2019,5,I get good treatment here and I feel they look after me and my wife.
Brandon,Good,7/3/2019,4,Delays at appointments are to be expected
Brandon,Good,7/3/2017,4,Works well. Can get appointments when needed.
Brandon,Good at trying to fit you in,8/17/2018,3,I reported to reception and waited quite a while and then found out that I hadn't been logged in! Good at trying to fit you in though.
Brandon,Good getting appointments some of the time,3/13/2017,4,"I understand the system so I book appointments for early on in the day as delays in the waiting room get worse as the day goes on. Overall they are all pretty good and will accommodate if they can. This said, an appointment can take 2 weeks."
Brandon,Good practice overall,11/5/2018,4,With some doctors we are called in late but they are prepared to spend a little extra time if needed so it all evens out I guess. It is a good practice overall
Brandon,"Good, would prefer more time with the GP",9/14/2017,4,I'm happy to wait to go in - doctor should be able to give you more time
Brandon,Great,11/26/2021,4,I have weekly blood tests to be able to have my chemo later in the week and I have no problems getting the appointments I need. I've had a phone consultation with the paramedic which went well as I was given antibiotics for a chest infection with out having to come in to the surgery.
Brandon,"great doctors,when you get to see one.",7/29/2021,3,No type 2 diabetes or blood pressure check for 18 months now and no sign of getting any.
Brandon,Great staff,11/26/2021,4,Routine appointments have been continuing throughout the pandemic. Staff have been great and it's generally working well at the moment for me.
Brandon,Happy with care,4/13/2022,5,I called this morning and have spoken to a GP who has then given me a face to face appointment so I am happy with how it has all worked.  I've never had any issues getting an appointment here and the care provided has always been good.
Brandon,Happy with care,11/26/2021,4,Have had phone consultations that have worked on the whole but at times a face to face appointment feels it would be more appropriate. Staff though explain issues well  and I'm happy with the care and support they provided.
Brandon,Happy with doctors,12/14/2022,5,"I've been able to get telephone appointments but I've not had a face to face for sometime. They do work but I don't feel they are ideal as seeing the patient is important. I've been happy with the doctors and nurses, theres no problem with the care and treatment. It would be good to have a more flexible system so that you don't have to call first thing to get an appointment, the system lets people down."
Brandon,hard working and very good,3/17/2017,5,I have been a patient for some years and the increase in demand has been apparent. They all work hard and a very good. It does take between one and two weeks for an appointment but an urgent appointment is usually available on the day if needed. I have had to wait 30 mins. after my appointment time but when I get in I don't feel rushed and i appreciate you can't have it both ways!
Brandon,Have to wait for continuity.,8/25/2019,4,You can have to wait over 30 mins before getting called in. I can have to wait 1-2 weeks to book an appointment to get continuity.
Brandon,Helpful staff,11/26/2021,5,Blood tests are available whenever I need them. The staff are so helpful and I have no complaints with how the surgery operates and nothing needs to change.
Brandon,Helpful staff,11/26/2021,4,"It's been fine at the moment, the telephone consultations have worked really well for me and I've not needed to have a face to face appointment"
Brandon,I am regularly seen 20 mins late,4/5/2018,4,I am regularly seen 20 mins late. I think this is simply down to demand and resources. Doctors are good and reception staff very friendly
Brandon,I book appointments online,4/5/2018,4,The surgery isn't dirty per se-it is more shabby and in need of a freshen up. I book my appointments online-this works much better for me.
Brandon,I can always get an 'on the day' emergency appt,4/5/2018,4,I have never-ever been seen on time. I have had to wait two weeks for this routine appointment which I guess is about average everywhere but I can always get an 'on the day' emergency appointment if I need one
Brandon,I don't have any problems,4/5/2018,5,Sometimes I have to wait and sometimes I don't. I have ALWAYS got an emergency appointment when I needed one. I don't have any problems with the practice.
Brandon,I got an appointment today.,5/30/2017,4,We are all pretty healthy so don't come that much. I called for an appointment at 8.00 this morning and had to re-dial a number of times to get through as it was busy.. That said I did get an appointment for today
Brandon,I have much more confidence,8/24/2018,4,Overall it isn't too bad. Doctors are much better nowadays (in my experience) and I have much more confidence. Appointment availability and timeliness are areas where improvements could still be made.
Brandon,I visit to make appointments,3/16/2017,4,I visit to make appointments because if I try to phone in it sometimes seems to ring for a long time
Brandon,I'm very happy here,4/5/2018,3,One doctor is excellent at explaining things to me. I had a very bad experience in the past but things are much better here now. I'm very happy to be a patient here
Brandon,improved significantly,5/30/2017,5,I have been a patient for some years and I would have to say the practice has improved significantly of late. I think my appointments are more in depth and look more at my current symptoms not at my past.
Brandon,It has improved over the last years,4/5/2018,4,It has improved over the last few years. There is more continuity now. We managed to get an 'on the day' appointment this morning
Brandon,It has improved significantly,11/5/2018,5,I have been a patient here for some years and despite the obvious increase in the demand for medical assistance things here are better than they used to be. No small trick! The practice has steadily improved (in my personal experience) over time
Brandon,It is brilliant!,8/24/2018,5,I moved house to a village near here and registered here. Compared with my last practice it is brilliant!. My new GP has been absolutely superb!!
Brandon,It suits me well,8/17/2018,5,I've been a patient here for quite a time. I'm retired and can come along anytime it suits me well. I think it had gotten better over the last few years.
Brandon,Just can’t get an appointment!,7/5/2022,2,"Call at 8am when they open, sat on the phone for 30 mins only to be told there’s no appointments for the day when call answered. Tried to do the app but can’t book appointments."
Brandon,Like moving back in time.,8/17/2018,2,"I moved to Brandon from a village in Cambridgeshire. I transferred from a large modern practice and this (surgery) is like moving back in time. It takes about two weeks to get a routine appointment, it is a bit of a worry as I am getting older."
Brandon,Long waiting times & doctor that doesn't engage,5/30/2017,5,It's very rare to get in at the appointment time-I have had to wait almost an hour on occasion. Also there is a doctor we decline to see because there is a lack of eye contact and  interaction.
Brandon,Love this surgery but...,8/18/2022,3,I love this surgery but it's not easy getting support from the doctors for family members I look after. I have power of attorney but the doctor still insists on talking to the person even though they have dementia and gets very confused.  It just makes eveything so much worse. It also means I have to stay with them if we need to contact the doctor as they won't talk to me unless they are there with me and I don't live with them.
Brandon,Lovely doctor,11/26/2021,5,Considering the circumstances they are doing excellently. My family sent in photos of something for me .and the doctor reviewed them and then gave me a prescription. I have a very caring doctor too which is lovely.
Brandon,Mainly talk to dr's on the phone,8/18/2022,2,"I've mainly talked to the doctors on the phone but I do not feel that this suits all circumstances as there is no discussion/ explanation and it feels that they aren't that interested. I do see one doctor who is very good but I didn't feel another was very supportive with mental health issues, just handed me tablets.  It would be great to be able to book appointments in advance as some issues aren't urgent or need dealing with on the day . Being able to book ahead of time would help with work and transport too. I do feel that the receptionists are really nice and helpful."
Brandon,male doctor i spoke with was very cobative,6/21/2022,1,"i only rang to correct a prescription  phone call 
intonation was agressive from the start and made it clear he didnt want me in the practice
he said he ran tight ship and didnt want people like me"
Brandon,Much improved,8/17/2018,3,I am now seen much closer to the actual appointment time than used to be the case-much improved. In fact most aspects seem to have improved in the last few years. Emergency appointment (on the day) are fine but routine take about a week.
Brandon,My doctor is fantastic,8/24/2018,5,My doctor is fantastic-he is so knowledgeable and thorough. At my first appointment he had taken the time to read all my notes before seeing me. He reviewed my medications and rationalised them. I now feel so much better all the time. I only see him now as (as far as I am concerned) he really has his finger on the pulse.
Brandon,My GP app works well,4/13/2022,4,"The My GP app works well and allows me to manage my parents health care needs although it does meant that they are less involved as they can not access online services and find speaking/ hearing on the phone difficult.  We have a face to face appointment today which is great but I would like to see easier access to face to face appointments  going forward but understand the situation is still difficult.  The surgery send letters out asking you to book an appointment for something, could they not just book an appointment and send you the date like the hospital does?"
Brandon,Never had an issue,12/18/2020,5,I have always received a first-class service from this surgery. I have not had any issue on any visit over the last 15 years.
Brandon,Never seem bothered,10/17/2020,1,if you go with anything hurting it never gets examined. Only advice seems to be paracetamol iron tablets and no caffine. They are the worst doctors i have ever been with. I wish we could move for better doctors surgery ):
Brandon,Nice little country practice,5/30/2017,5,This is a nice little country practice. The reception staff are all warm and friendly and eager to do what they can for you. Drs are all pretty good as well. All in all I'm happy to be a patient here.
Brandon,No issues,10/31/2022,5,I hardly ever need to go to the surgery but when I have needed to be seen I've been able to get an appointment with no issues. From my perspective it all works well.
Brandon,Not available to see patients,5/19/2021,1,"Unwilling to visit an elderly patient with an ongoing condition who is feeling breathless and generally unwell, who has no means of transport to get to surgery if the dr was willing to see them face to face - but will not even do that."
Brandon,Not seen anyone for some time,12/14/2022,1,I haven't seen anyone for some time and have only had phone calls with the doctors which have worked ok but I do feel I need to see someone. I asked today to be seen and I've been given an appointment to see a doctor.  The phones when you call the surgery are very busy and by the time you get through am or pm you can be told there are no call backs available and to try again the next day.  Getting a non urgent issue addressed has also been difficult.
Brandon,Noticed improvements,8/25/2019,4,"Have noticed significant improvements with the reception staff, they are now very helpful. Doctor is fantastic, rate highly."
Brandon,Nurses are great,8/18/2022,4,I try to see the nurses if at all possible over the doctors as they explain things well and have time to listen where as the doctors don't always do this when they are busy. By and large its a pretty good surgery and I like that I'm able to get my blood tests done at the surgery as it is much easier than travelling to Newmarket or West Suffolk Hospital.
Brandon,Nurses are usually running on time,5/30/2017,4,I always arrive for my appointments on time- nurses are usually running on time but there is usually a delay with doctors. Online booking is good.
Brandon,On Mondays you can't get through on the phone,3/16/2017,4,On Mondays you can't get through on the phone to book an appointment. It would also be good to be notified when existing doctors leave the practice and when new ones join.
Brandon,One of the doctors is very thorough,8/17/2018,3,"I am always 10-30 mins late being called in but I never feel rushed when I am in the consultation though. One of the doctors is very thorough and interested, the others not so much."
Brandon,"Overall, clinically quite good",4/5/2018,4,Overall the surgery is clinically quite good. MY doctor is VERY good-I always book on her working days. I have just discovered online booking and it is really good.
Brandon,Penalised for being late,3/17/2017,3,If you are five minutes late they won't see you but there can be as much as a 45 minute delay the other way around.
Brandon,Phone consultations work,11/26/2021,4,Providing that its a routine issue like blood tests there are no problems getting an appointment. The phone consultations do the job but I'm not so comfortable with it compared to having a face to face appointment as it gives you more confidence if you've been seen.
Brandon,Phones are busy,9/14/2022,4,"I've not actually seen a GP in quite some time but I've always had conversations with them when needed which have addressed the issues. Once through to the surgery the staff are good and the Emergency Care Practitioner is great, they tale time to explain issues very well"
Brandon,phones very busy,11/4/2022,3,"My last two vitamin B12 have been delayed by weeks as it's been very difficult to get the appointment. Having to call at either 8 or 2 when you work is very difficult when you may have to wait up to 40 minutes. A family member has also had difficulties with different staff members having differing opinions, which has been incredibly stressful."
Brandon,Poor appointment allocation system,9/23/2021,2,"Phoned at 8am and 2pm on 2 separate ocassions to book the appointment that I need and told there's no appointments left, call back tomorrow at 8am. Not helpful, rules are the rules etc...disappointing"
Brandon,Poor appointment system,3/5/2022,1,"Why are we still having to phone for a doctors appointment?? At 8 or 2. 
For people that work this system is ridiculous! When you get an appointment you don’t get a time. When can we start to book appointments on line at a time we want it?  You can book other appointments on line!"
Brandon,Poor attitude from receptionists and often given cheap drugs,9/14/2017,2,Attitude of receptionists can be a bit off.  Also no follow up for Diabetes jab.  Often given cheapest drugs rather than what is best for me
Brandon,"Poor. Clinicians good, receptionists poor",9/14/2017,2,Clinicians are fine but reception staff are not so good
Brandon,Pretty good all round,11/5/2018,4,The practice is pretty good all round. Getting an appointment isn't too bad. Sometimes I am a few minutes late being called in but all the clinical staff I have seen here have been lovely
Brandon,Pretty good.,8/25/2019,4,It can be challenging to get a blood test. Many people have trouble hearing and a screen giving name or tannoy would be helpful. They are pretty good here though.
Brandon,Quick appointment,8/18/2022,5,I called yesterday afternoon and they arranged an appointment for me to see the emergency care practitioner this morning which has worked really well.
Brandon,Quite efficient,12/14/2022,4,I've just had a pre-booked appointment for my flu vaccination which was easy to get. For urgent on the day issues it's been fine to get appointments and I've been seen on the day.  Sometimes having to call first thing is a bit frustrating but I'm happy with the care provided by staff and the nurses are really good.
Brandon,Really good doctor,11/26/2021,5,I have a really good doctor who reacted really quickly and referred me to hospital. The appointment for the hospital came through the next morning and I had the appointment with in a week. Getting my blood tests are fine as they're booked in advance but getting a face to face is a bit more challenging.
Brandon,reception staff are brilliant,8/17/2018,5,"I don't come here very often but in the past there have been some waits to be called in. I have nothing much to complain about other than to be more prompt. Reception staff are brilliant, doctors are pretty good too. I am happy that I come here."
Brandon,Reception staff are exemplary.,3/17/2017,4,There are pressures on the practice and appointments can be a bit of an issue. hi said the reception staff are exemplary and do all they can to fit me in asap.
Brandon,reception staff are variable,11/5/2018,3,"Some of the receptionists aren't very polite-they can be 'off' with me. To be fair that's not all of them, some are helpful, some are not, it is variable"
Brandon,Saturday morning surgery is good,8/17/2018,4,Getting an appointment is difficult if you work full time-though monthly Saturday morning surgery helps with this. They look after my son very well.
Brandon,Some of the doctors are really good,4/5/2018,3,Some of the doctors are really good-but not all! A delay of up to 20 mins in being called in to the appointment is not unusual but if I arrive late I don't get seem.
Brandon,Staff are BRILLIANT,4/5/2018,5,"Every time we have been here we have been satisfied. That said, probably only on one occasion have we been seen on time in recent years! You can't be late though. Staff are BRILLIANT"
Brandon,Staff are good,11/26/2021,4,"They are running late this morning, 45 mins, not normally this long though. I'm happy to see the nurse and staff are all very good at explaining things and the care is great. The nurse even picked up on something I hadn't even come in for which was great."
Brandon,Staff are great,8/18/2022,5,I've had no problems getting appointments and have had a pre booked appointment to see the nurse today. Staff are great and I've had no issues getting help when I've needed it. Overall I'm very happy with the surgery.
Brandon,Staff are usually very helpful,3/17/2017,3,"Staff are usually very helpful but I don't think the doctors are as good as they were, I'm never seen on time for an appointment. When you do get in you can only discuss one issue and it feels hurried. Old people need time to answer questions, not 2 seconds."
Brandon,Staff are very good but getting appointments problematic,3/16/2017,4,Getting an appointment with a specific doctor can take a while. The length of time that the book is open (i.e. how far in advance it is possible to book) seems to vary from time to time. The staff are all very good.
Brandon,"Staff attitudes vary, ok getting appointments",3/13/2017,4,"Staff attitude depends on who you get (GP). Getting an appointment isn't too bad and you can always attend as an emergency on the day, routine is 2-3 weeks. Reception staff are very good but one nurse is very brusque to the point of being rude."
Brandon,Staff very helpful and friendly,1/11/2021,5,"Spoke to receptionist and explained what the problem was, they were very kind and professional and asked me to call back at 2. Phoned back at 2 was 10th in the queue! Got to speak to another receptionist who said someone would call me this afternoon and within 10 minutes I had a call, explained the problem and within the hour I was picking up a prescription. Fantastic service."
Brandon,Staff was very helpful,10/24/2018,4,I don't use the practice very often as we are quite a healthy family. Overall the practice has been ok but getting appointments and being seen on time were the main issues on the times we have had to go. That said I did have to take my daughter for injections recently and the staff was very helpful on that visit-particularly the nurse
Brandon,Struggled in pregnancy to be seen,4/13/2022,4,"I had an issue that came up in the later stages of my pregnancy but I couldn't get seen by a GP,  in the end my midwife  contacted the surgery and I was then seen and treated. I was also told by a GP over the phone to go to A&E, which they weren't happy about, for something that they could've treated.  Although I have had issues getting seen myself I've not had the same issues when it comes to the care of my baby, the care provided has been very good and we've got a face to face appointment with a GP today."
Brandon,Superficial explanations of treatment,3/13/2017,3,The explanation of treatment can be a bit superficial but they are good if you question them. Appointments take a while to get.
Brandon,The Doctor seemed very uncaring and arrogant.,7/9/2020,1,"Go somewhere else, seriously. I’ve never met such an unprofessional uncaring doctor such as here. He dismissed everything I was explaining to him and genuinely didn’t seem bothered."
Brandon,The service has got worse & hard to get an appointment,3/16/2017,3,I have been a patient here for many years and things have got worse not better. It can take 2-3 weeks for a routine appointment now.
Brandon,The staff are very welcoming,11/5/2018,4,I have registered relatively recently. This was a transfer from a practice where I didn't feel well supported. The staff here were very welcoming and made the process of registering very easy for me.
Brandon,The whole team treat me as an individual,10/2/2021,5,"It doesn't matter who in the team I speak to, I feel as if my needs are important and I am valued as a patient."
Brandon,They are overloaded and long delays in booking appts,3/17/2017,3,They are overloaded.There is a long wait for get an appointment and they are tardy on the day. There are too many locums and things seem to have deteriorated over time.
Brandon,They are very accommodating for appointments,3/13/2017,5,I work shifts which can make things a bit difficult but they are very accommodating
Brandon,They give me plenty of time.,8/25/2019,4,You do have to wait a while for the doctor (1-2 weeks). I am very happy with the doctors and they give me plenty of time.
Brandon,Things have settled down,11/26/2021,5,"Getting blood tests has been fine. I've also had appointments with the paramedic and they've been able to sort out the issues, he gives me confidence and overall things have now settled down a bit."
Brandon,Timed call backs are great,8/18/2022,4,"The phones are busy when contacting the surgery but the timed call backs by GPs are great.  The nurses are wonderful and put you at ease and are easy to talk to and I've had no issues getting to see them. The emergency care practitioner is very good too, again they have time for you to discuss the issues."
Brandon,Treatment explanation varies,8/25/2019,4,Getting an appointment you do have to wait up to 4 weeks if you want the same GP. Treatment explanation is rated depending on who you see.
Brandon,"UNABLE TO SEE A NURSE TO LOOK IN MY EAR,",7/29/2022,1,"I asked to see a nurse to see if I had any cotton wool left in ear after taking a shower, I was told to go to A and E at Bury as there was no Nurse on duty, I then asked if i could see a Dr as it take about 10 seconds to see there was any cotton wool left, I was then told that a DR could not do it as there was not a nurse on duty,   I then tried to explain it would take 30 seconds at the very most, I was then told to phone back at 2oclock and somebody would talk to me. I really find this to totally unbelievable. No wonder the NHS  is struggling with this type of service."
Brandon,Understandable delays,5/30/2017,5,demand for services has increased substantially and as a result there are understandable delays at time. I don't find these to be a problem.
Brandon,Unhelpful and dismissive,9/10/2020,1,Unhelpful and dismissive
Brandon,Unpleasant experience...,7/23/2021,2,"One of the receptionists is abrasive and lacks empathy. I tried to explain my mental health issues and explained that I have to rely on a friend to take me to appointments. They were not interested. I only needed a blood test. I asked if they could call me if any one cancelled during the following week, as my friend was available to go with me. They refused point blank saying ""we don’t do that here’’.  I thought mental health was supposed to be better understood these days...clearly not, it seems."
Brandon,Unwilling to change medication,8/25/2019,4,"I saw a locum doctor about 4 months ago and he was unwilling to change my regular pain medication so I then had to wait and see the regular GP, which was another two week wait. To see a doctor is a longer wait than for a nurse. Car park too small."
Brandon,Vaccinations and blood tests fine,11/26/2021,3,Have had a number of phone consultations but none have solved the problems and 4 weeks later I've seen someone but I'm still having difficulties. Doctors and nurses are lovely but I do find that reception can be a little unhelpful as they just say call back at 8am when all the appointments are gone that day. I understand that they can only say what they are told to say when all the appointments are gone but it doesn't help the problem.
Brandon,Very difficult to get past the receptionist.,6/21/2021,3,Some time you need to talk with a qualified doctor.
Brandon,Very good with my son,8/17/2018,5,"The practice is very good with my son, I can get him an appointment pretty easily when he is unwell. I don't have much cause to come in myself but it is top marks or the way they look after him."
Brandon,Very good.,8/25/2019,4,The doctors here are very good. I book appointments online. You do have to wait to get into the surgery. Car park is too small.
Brandon,Very happy overall,8/25/2019,5,When I try to book appointment online it always says no appointments. Very happy with surgery overall.
Brandon,Very pleasant staff,12/14/2022,4,I don't come often but the staff are always pleasant. I was told to call at 8am for a nurse appointment which I did but when I got through after 1/2 hr there were no appointments available. I was then told that they could book me an appointment the next day so I didn't really need to be calling with everyone else first thing in the morning for a nurse appointment.  Staff just need to be a little more careful that they are telling patients the correct things. Other than this the surgery is good.
Brandon,Very positive impact,8/24/2018,4,Nurses and paramedic seem to have had a very positive impact on the practice. Things seem 'quicker' somehow. There are less frustrations and better service.
Brandon,Very thorough and professional,8/24/2018,5,I transferred to here from another practice. I find that there is a great attitude from reception through to the clinicians. Nurses and doctors are thorough and professional. I am very glad that I made the move.
Brandon,Waiting for appointment too long,3/13/2017,3,I have an ongoing eye condition which sometimes needs immediate medication when I get a 'flare up'. I once had to wait 2-3 weeks to see a GP then 4-5 weeks for an appointment at West Suffolk Hospital. When I was seen I was told off by the clinician for waiting so long!
Brandon,Waiting time 3 to 4 weeks is to long,3/24/2018,3,Receptionists are fine doctors are somewhat good. But what bugs me is they never seem to want to refer any health issues you have. I get a sense this is because of cost. I would love to be told I am wrong.
Bridge,15 minutes to pick up,5/9/2018,3,"I do not use the surgery much, but recently I have needed to. I find the phone system strange as today when I called at 8.20am it took 15 minutes before anyone picked up. I did get an appointment with a GP. I prefer that routine appointments are pre-bookable and that you only use the phone 'on the day' for emergencies. As a trained receptionist myself, I find 15 minutes before a phone is picked up is unacceptable and they need to sort it out."
Bridge,2nd Opinion,2/13/2019,3,"Here today for a 2nd opinion as the last time I was in I had to see a Nurse on the last appointment of the day and I really felt like they just could not be bothered with me.
As it is my day off I have had to say it is any emergency otherwise I would not get seen at a convenient time."
Bridge,4 weeks to get appointment,6/10/2016,3,It has become more and more difficult to get an appointment when you need one since taking on more patients after the recent shutting of one in the area. 4 weeks is just not acceptable to get an appointment when you are ill and would no doubt be fully recovered by then.
Bridge,Access good to service for us,2/11/2022,4,See a regular Nurse here and then if they need to access a GP they get them in on that day. Having delay on getting to a 'swallowing clinic' for my family member with Parkinson's.
Bridge,Access to appointments is poor,5/16/2019,3,"After calling the surgery for 2 days on the trot for my daughter and being told there were no appointments available, we called 111 and had to go to James Paget, who gave my daughter a prescription. On the 3rd day she was still having further issues and the surgery did have an appointment so we went. On the first two occasions there was no suggestion of going to a pharmacy for advice, or making a weekend appointment. I didn't know until today that there is such a thing, but will ask for one if I find myself in that situation again as the surgery is much more convenient that James Paget."
Bridge,All good,4/11/2021,5,I am seeing the Nurse today who is always really good. The reception team I find are always very friendly.
Bridge,Always get an appointment when I need one,3/22/2018,4,"I do not use the surgery often but when I need appointment I do get one. If it's an emergency, I understand that I cannot always see my own GP."
Bridge,Appointment availability confusing,5/16/2019,3,I called on the day today and got an appointment. I asked to see my own GP and they said she is too busy already. My friend called the surgery and was offered a 'next day' appointment and it was with a GP so not sure why that happened as that is not 'on the day'. It's confusing when you hear that.
Bridge,Appointment system better,2/13/2019,4,"I have found of late that the appointment system is much better.  I was sceptical to hear there would be only 'on the day' appointments but the last two times I have needed to see someone I have got and appointment on the day, no trouble at all. Seems they have it right."
Bridge,Appointment system not great,5/16/2019,4,Today we got through in 15 minutes on the telephone AND I got an appointment. However it was because I had a call to say I needed to make an appointment today from my GP. I called the day I got the message but was told to call back on the day I was asked to see the GP and ask for an 'on the day' appointment.
Bridge,Appointments can be tricky as well as waiting,6/5/2018,3,"Managed to get an appointment today when I could at about 8:15am. No idea what GP I am seeing though and today I have waited 30 minutes past my time, even though the check-in screen say 13 mins."
Bridge,Asking a question means filling in a form,6/12/2021,1,"Wanted to ask a question so clicked on ""Ask reception a question"". Had to fill in a form on line but when tried it says ""Sorry we are fully booked for appointments. Should you feel you have a matter which is Clinically Urgent and you feel must be dealt with today, please telephone reception on 01502 565936. Otherwise please submit a form tomorrow."" I don't want an appointment and my question is not clinically urgent. How are you supposed to get a simple question answered??"
Bridge,Asthma so bad but ignored,5/8/2016,3,"In December 2015 I had my asthma clinic assessment. I was asked if it was under control, and I flatly told them 'no'. They did nothing, changed nothing and didn't keep check on me. They just said to come back in a year. I had about 6 months of being bed-ridden which made me really depressed. My family were concerned and my husband who still works felt terrible having to leave me, although he was always on the end of the mobile phone. My appetite was gone and I went back in May and asked the doctor what else can they do, but nothing was offered. We went to Menorca and I was really ill so had to go to the clinic and they put me on a Nebulizer and I was sent to hospital there as an emergency. The difference in my was amazing and my husband was so pleased to see the colour back in my cheeks. We got back on Sunday from Menorca and called our GP Monday but they could only offer an appointment for 2 weeks time and this was far more urgent than that. So we turned up at A&E as we felt we had no other option. As a result they are going to get me a nebulizer for my home.
We were also given a new GP after 13 years with no notification. It was a shock to call and be told we were now under another GP, even though our GP still practices there."
Bridge,Awful,9/12/2022,1,"I'm not one to ever ring the GP unless I actually need to. So I follow the process that's suggested online, I fill out the forms like they tell you to then within 30 seconds of sending the form they are fully booked. How at 8am can they be fully booked! I have a heart condition and suffer with my mental health and I am unable to get an appointment, let alone a phone appointment anything!"
Bridge,Better encounter than last one,6/28/2021,2,"The last encounter I had with a member of the reception staff was a positive one - the staff member was a different one from the rude, indifferent receptionist who prompted my leaving the feedback on your website previously.  Although this wasn't the first time this sort of rudeness had happened it was happening more and more often - to the point where I didn't really want to have to go to the surgery and have to ""run the gauntlet"" of the reception staff.  I get the impression that the reception staff  require good training in how to engage with the public.  If a receptionist is unable to deal with a person straight away then a polite acknowledgement that they are aware you are there and will attend to you as soon as they can is all it takes and when finally engaging person to person then a friendly, helpful approach makes all the difference to having a good, positive experience at the surgery rather than coming away feeling that you have been treated rudely and as though you don't matter and are a nuisance.  After all - without the patients there would be no need for a receptionist!!!!  Also, it has made me question in the past, why do people do a job which involves interacting with the public if they blatantly don't like doing it?!!!

I am a retired NHS hospital medical secretary and know the importance of a kind and caring approach to patients.  In all the years I have been registered at this practice I have never made a complaint or left negative feedback until now; it seems to me that the standards at Bridge Road Surgery are in decline at the moment.  I would like to be clear that I understand the restrictions the NHS is having to work under due to Covid 19 but the decline at Bridge Road Surgery started well before 2020."
Bridge,Bloods at the surgery is more difficult,6/5/2018,3,Having regular monthly blood tests used to be much easier at James Paget or Lowestoft hospital. The last time I came to the surgery they had to try 6 times before getting blood out. The girl was very frustrated. A different person did it the next time and it was much quicker. Having them as regular as I do trying to tie in the appointment with medication changes can be difficult to coordinate.
Bridge,Brilliant weekend surgery,9/17/2019,4,Having the weekend surgery is brilliant. My husband works away and only here weekends so can access this service easily.
Bridge,Calling after 2pm-No GP's,2/13/2019,4,"If you miss the morning surgery slots, you are asked to call again at 2 pm, so far though no GP has ever been available. It seems that there are only Nurses working in the afternoon.  I feel asking 'is it an emergency' is the wrong question, because if you are only offering on the day appointments you will never access the service unless it is considered an emergency which many illnesses are not, but do need medical attention."
Bridge,Can’t get a appointment!!!,6/18/2018,1,Can’t get a appointment anymore ! A new system introduced where you have to ring up on the day to see a doctor! So anyone that works for a living is out of luck ! Phone line just rings now Instead or a engaged tone. I’ve been at this surgery since it opened but i'm now leaving to go elsewhere.
Bridge,Cancer referral,4/2/2020,5,"It only took 1 visit to my GP before I got referred for possible cancer. My doctor saw the red flag symptoms and referred me. Also after I got my diagnosis and had had my treatment, she was concerned that I was not putting on weight and so referred me again - which led to a second diagnosis"
Bridge,Can't call during opening hours,10/23/2018,2,"I've just tried ringing the surgery and I get a message saying the surgery is closed. The message continues to say that the opening hours are 8am - 6:30pm Monday - Friday... why are you closed at 5pm on a Tuesday then?!
Left similar feedback last week regarding being unable to get through to make an appointment in the mornings and heard nothing back."
Bridge,Cant get seen and phones not answered,7/30/2018,1,"Useless! Phone appt waste of time, took 2 weeks to even get that, referal letter from physio was not read, practice supposed to be open til 6.30 but phones are shut off at 5pm, had enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Bridge,Changed for the better,2/14/2019,4,The appointment system has changed for the better.  You generally get appointment with your choice of GP if it is a ongoing thing.  I don't mind seeing other clinicians for general things though.
Bridge,Communication is Great!,1/26/2021,5,Doctor phoned me back in a couple of hours of sending email. Everything sorted straight away. Receptionist communication really great!
Bridge,Concerns around my knee replacement.,4/15/2021,5,"I emailed the surgery and received a reply today suggesting initially an X-ray.
All information needed sent.
Great service."
Bridge,Delay in diagnosis,5/9/2018,3,"I believe a delay in seeing a GP and constantly seeing a nurse, delayed my diagnosis which caused extra infection issues.
You do not see your own GP as much anymore. I wanted to see a GP after 3 months of seeing a Nurse and Nurse Practitioner, and I was still ill. I did not get to see one. I then got another inspection on my leg which was related. They took swabs to try and give me the correct anti-biotics. Again I would have preferred to see a GP, as they had to keep changing these too. I didn't feel they had the right knowledge and it was a bit of a guessing game."
Bridge,Did not see who I expected,2/14/2019,3,"On a positive note, I think the phone system works really well, and did for me today.  I do however find it unusual that you expect that you are seeing a GP but end up being seen a Nurse without being told that."
Bridge,Difficult to get through on the telephone,5/9/2018,4,"I have found it difficult to get through on the telephone, and once you do I was told that I should have rang at 8am. I felt that was extremely rude, and the fact was, that I had been on the phone since 8am trying to get through. Please take responsibility, do not blame the patient!"
Bridge,Discriminatory,8/25/2021,1,It is almost impossible to book an appointment to see my GP if I do not own a smart phone or computer. Many people my age do not own such items and are left with considerable difficulty obtaining appointments.
Bridge,DRS excellent once you get past receptionist,12/21/2020,3,Spent 20mins on the phone today as couldn't get website to load only to be greeted with a really unhelpful receptionist who basically told me to keep trying as she was able to access it. Didn't offer any other help. Absolutely not good enough. Its ashame as once you speak to a Dr they are great! Need to retrain receptionist to show some kindness and compassion.
Bridge,Efficient,9/29/2016,4,"Clear and easy to understand service. Efficient.  Appointments do not seem rushed, spend time with GP."
Bridge,Excellent,5/9/2018,5,I find the surgery excellent. Very Caring staff that I see are nice. Nothing is too much trouble
Bridge,Excellent,11/24/2016,5,Have only been at surgery 1 year.  They came out to me twice and were very good.
Bridge,Excellent care,2/11/2022,5,"I saw the GP and had follow-up blood tests about a week later. Excellent care given as I have a needle phobia. The professional really took their time and gave me good reassurance, which enabled me to get through it without fainting or being sick!"
Bridge,Excellent GP,9/17/2019,4,"Due to 'on the day' call in at 8am and 2pm, I have started to 'walk in' to get an appointment.
My GP makes advanced appointments for me too, as I have multiple ongoing conditions, so this is excellent. I cannot but praise the surgery for this."
Bridge,"Excellent, can't be faulted.",4/27/2022,4,"I was having problems with my right hand, sent my named GP a photo, he got back to me within 24 hours to arrange an appointment within 2 days, referred me on immediately for x-rays"
Bridge,Excellent. Appointments run to time and GP listens.,8/14/2017,5,Always run on time.  GP listens to me well.  When Marine Parade closed I was moved to Oulton Broad which is quite far for me with bad knees.  It will be quite interesting to see what it is like in winter.  Getting my repeat prescription is easy as is getting an advance appointment
Bridge,Extremely disappointed and angry,2/19/2021,1,"I filled in a form online to speak to/see a nurse. I had what I thought to be infection or allergy. My symptoms were still present after nearly a week so decided to get medical advice. I got an email from the surgery saying they would call me the next day- no specific time slot. However 3 days after sending my email, still haven't heard from them. Fortunately my symptoms seem to be clearing on their own or it would have been a trip to A and E. Very disappointed that firstly, they were going to leave it a day before even calling, and secondly they did not even bother with the call they had arranged anyway. Just thankful my symptoms did not severely worsen or turn into something more threatening- I wanted advice as to whether this would happen but didn't receive any. Will not be putting any faith or trust into them again. Very let down."
Bridge,Feel supported and cared for,5/16/2019,5,"The surgeries nurses are excellent. Recent type 2 diagnosis means that I oped for the 'glow' programme linked with Cambridge university for research purposes. I was put on weight watchers and my levels are already better managed.I had a recent blood test and received a 'well done' text from the nurse, which was lovely. I feel supported and cared for throughout this whole process."
Bridge,Felt palmed off,4/11/2021,4,Been waiting ages for a referral which finally happened. Felt palmed off by surgery and was never given a face to face by GP until the JPUH got in contact after I turned up at A & E.
Bridge,First class as always,1/26/2021,5,"Through all this pandemic, with the health issues i have had, the service i have received has been absolutely fantastic, i cannot thank all at the surgery enough."
Bridge,First class care.,10/1/2021,5,"Had an appointment with practice nurse. Very professional, made me feel at ease. I am 76 years old and in my opinion this person has people skills not found very often in this day and age."
Bridge,Flu clinic,4/11/2021,4,I couldn't get into the flu clinic at the surgery but we needed it so had to book with the pharmacy which I know is less agreeable to them. Today our appointment is running 30 mins late but not sure why as just for a jab.
Bridge,Get through quicker,2/14/2019,4,"Phoned today and was 20th in the queue, which sounds a lot but I spoke to someone quite quickly. It is good to know where you are in the queue.  I am happy with the service provided. They have adapted and for me, it is much improved"
Bridge,Getting appointments isn't easy,5/16/2019,3,I generally have had problems getting an appointment here. I see people queued outside the door to try to bypass the telephone system. Today I got through straight away and got an appointment so that was surprising!
Bridge,Getting through on phone hard,5/9/2018,4,"Once I see my GP or Nurse, everything is good. Recently though I called about 1.45pm as I had been putting up with a bite on my leg for almost a week, and it was getting worse. I hung on the phone waiting for almost 15 minutes before anyone answered. I did get to see a nurse that day. I felt the phone waiting was rather too long."
Bridge,Good,8/24/2017,4,Really good practice.  Cannot fault apart from the fact that it can sometimes be difficult to get an appointment
Bridge,Good,8/14/2017,4,Surgery is above average
Bridge,Good,11/24/2016,4,All very good here
Bridge,Good care for us,10/1/2020,5,"I have found the service works fine for me and my family who have all had to come here over the last few months for flu jabs and chesty cough mainly.
Staff are caring, and reception are good at helping you if you are not sure about something"
Bridge,Good coordination of care,10/1/2020,5,"I had to have some blood tests and an injection.  The blood test was booked originally for the afternoon, so quite a gap after my injection was booked, however, a Nurse (I think it was a nurse) contacted me and changed it to nearer the injection time.  When I arrived early, the Nurse doing the bloods came out and got me as she had seen I was in, and someone had not turned up, so she took me in early then I had the injection afterwards with a different person.  Not sure why the Nurse could not do both, but alas it was well coordinated in the end due to the vigilance of the staff, and although I do not have other commitments, it was nicer to spend less time in the surgery than originally thought I would"
Bridge,Good system,2/14/2019,4,"I am very impressed by the new telephone and appointment system.
You always get an appointment on the day once you have spoken to someone."
Bridge,Good with the kids,10/1/2020,4,"I find it difficult to get an appointment for myself, however they are great at seeing the kids and I care about that more.  Lovely Nurse we see most of the time who always is very kind and the children when unwell get fractious, but she is patient. As a parent that is what you need for the kids"
Bridge,Got Online,10/1/2020,4,"We signed up to doing things 'online' and find it to be a good option, not always able to get what you need appointment wise, but we have been more successful and it is less frustrating than trying to ring in in the morning."
Bridge,GP appointments are predominantly late,6/5/2018,3,"Appointments with nurse always on time but GP, they are usually late. When calling at 3pm for afternoon clinic, I was on hold for 15 mins"
Bridge,Happy with the service,5/29/2015,5,"Staff always treat me well, I can always get an appointment when I need one and as quickly as I would like. No changes to service required."
Bridge,Hard to get appointment on day,10/1/2020,3,"I get very frustrated ringing the surgery first thing in the morning, bang on 8am I am then in a queue and by the time I get through they say all appointments have gone.
I do try and look online too but never had any success.  Today is a 'check-up' advanced appointment which they contact you for, so that is fine.
Staff are ok, and I understand the system is stretched.  I have never been offered a weekend appointment option though, which I would take. Did not know they did them, so will ask next time."
Bridge,Have had to wait 6 weeks for appointment,10/11/2017,4,It is not easy to see your own GP here anymore. I have had to wait 6 weeks once. On the day appointments are practically impossible to get.
Bridge,Helped me out,10/1/2020,4,"When I was having trouble with my prescription, I found the staff very helpful as I do get confused. My appointment today is running rather behind, but I do understand this can happen."
Bridge,"Hi, I 'phoned the surgery on Friday 29th Jan.",1/31/2021,5,"to be seen by a doctor. I explained that I couldn't get to the surgery and the receptionist said that she would get a doctor to 'phone back. Dr 'phoned me and arranged a doctor to come out to me. The doctor came and advised me to go straight to hospital. May I say a big Thank You to all concerned as it was less than 2hrs from the initial call to arriving at hospital. Bridge Rd Surgery
THANK YOU!"
Bridge,I book my appointments online,9/17/2019,5,I generally see same GP which is great I book online and know the says my GP works. More people need to use the online services which takes the pressure off the phone lines.
Bridge,I can’t book an appointment,5/17/2021,1,"I’ve been trying for weeks to get an appointment. I don’t need an urgent one, I would just like to speak to my doctor about an ongoing issue. You can’t even attempt to book in when surgery is closed and you can’t make an advanced appointment. The system doesn’t work for working people that can’t get online at 8 in order to book first appointment.
My mental health is suffering due to this and I’m ok. For people that really get depressed and struggling this is a horrible system."
Bridge,I come in to make appointment,2/14/2019,3,"Waiting at about number 20 in the queue for me is not acceptable.  I now come in to the surgery to make my appointment instead.  The HWS CDO told me how others had said they get through within about 10 minutes as many staff answer the 'phones.  I did not realise you would be through as quick as that, so I will give it a try next time."
Bridge,I have had no problem until  now,1/12/2020,1,"You received a letter from dvla for lorry licence in August i phoned last week to be told that the letter was received in October. I explained might lose my job phoned this morning, and it was confirmed that the letter that bridge road received still hadn't been returned."
Bridge,I use online.....,1/12/2021,2,"We are told to use the online system when we can. I am constantly putting in the form and just getting a message saying there is not appointments. I do not even get a booked for a phone call. They want you to use a system, that you use, but you still get nowhere. It is ridiculous!!"
Bridge,I walk in now,6/16/2023,2,"Just find it so difficult to get appointments here. I have taken to walking in now as when I ring and wait 30-45 mins the msg states 'we have no appointments left for today.' then it is never a GP. I am not being offered a weekend one, but will ask next time now I know they do this."
Bridge,impossible eto get an appointment,9/15/2022,1,practice say they no longer allow appointments to be made in advance. They only allow appointments to be made at 8am on the day on a first come first serves basis for serious issues. I have telephoned on three occasions and have been denied an appointment. Practice inform me that they consider my request is for a routine review. It is in fact urgent to discuss ongoing serious issues
Bridge,impossible to get an appointment,11/5/2018,1,"receptionists don't answer the phone, no continuity of treatment-never see the same doctor twice, heaven knows what would happen to someone who had a serious issue-virtually impossible to get in. Took over half the patients from another practice-now it is swamped"
Bridge,Impossible to get appointment,4/20/2021,1,"What has happened to just being able to call surgery and make an appointment???? Just ridiculous trying to explain issues on an online form then waiting for a call only to be told you need to visit surgery anyway. When you visit surgery, the reception has music blaring out so this, on top of face masks, just can't hear receptionists talking to you."
Bridge,Impossible to get B12 injections,5/26/2021,5,"It is Impossible to get B12 injections at this surgery at the correct frequency, for the past 9 years I have had a B12 defficiency, and my GP will not even consider allowing me to have them more frequently. As a result of this decision I have had to take things into my own hands and ordered the B12 online to help maintain my health. Other than this issue the surgery have been excellent."
Bridge,Impossible to ring in for any reason,7/10/2018,1,"Despite supposedly having a new phone system installed, it's virtually impossible to get through on the phone. The fact is, you can ring and ring for ages but nobody answers. I've been there in person when the phone rang but both receptionists did not answer it. If anyone is really ill I fear for their well-being as chances of getting help, apart from going down in person, are minimal. No wonder A&E are stretched"
Bridge,Ineffective booking system for starters.,6/21/2021,2,"My mother has ongoing health issues that have not been properly addressed.  The practice does not take phone bookings, reporting that it is ""quicker and easier for you to book online"".  After filling out a lengthy referral process on her behalf I was informed that her GP doesn't work today and please fill out another form tomorrow.  I asked if the information could be passed to the GP tomorrow but was told ""no, the system doesn't work like that"".
How is this quicker and easier for me?"
Bridge,It is an excellent surgery all round.,6/10/2015,5,"The receptionists are great and the G.P.s really listen to your problems. You can get an appointment the same day if urgent, or within 24 hrs otherwise. I also like the practice nurses who can prescribe, which is a great idea."
Bridge,It is impossible see anyone face to face,3/23/2023,1,"Nearly every time I try to book online all appointments are booked. I have not been able to use this since 2019 as its always fully booked.
  After spending 7 hours in A&E in December on the advice of 111 I was told to make a GP appointment. I had to go into the surgery and demand attention, this upset the staff which I did not want to do. I have NOT seen anyone from the surgery. I have had a phone call. I have had blood tests and seen a physio  but no-one has looked at my back to ascertain the cause of the  problem."
Bridge,Lack of appointments,11/25/2019,2,"Unable to get an appointment, told by surgery manager go to A & E and put more pressure on them, cannot get an appointment, have to go round every day when open and then after 2 pm to get an appoint ment, really does not work"
Bridge,Lovely surgery,10/1/2020,5,"I can only think of good things about the surgery, which has changed.  I am sure they are under a lot of pressure, but it seems they have coping and the systems are working for me as they are now.  I used to have a lot of problems getting appointments, but find it is now much easier, when I need them, which is not often."
Bridge,Lovely visit but rules need revising,7/30/2021,2,"Me and my Husband recently attended our Midwife appointment (this was all fine) where we normally sit together in the waiting room. However, there are now no seats together as you have to leave two seats free per every seat!
This is not the case at all anywhere else even in hospitals so I sat on a seat next to my husband which had a note on and was told off! 
We advised the man that it was a very silly rule and did you expect children and parents, elderly and the caregivers to all sit 3 seats apart too?
Please make there an option for couples/those coming together to sit next to each other as well as single seats as this is just ridiculous!"
Bridge,Mixed experience,10/1/2020,3,"I have had mixed experience at this surgery. I find it depends on who you are seeing and if you need advanced or 'on the day' appointments. Sometimes I get through really easily on the telephone but no appointments, but other times they do, it is just luck."
Bridge,Mixed experience booking appointments,5/9/2018,4,"I have had mixed experience booking appointments here. When I have called at 8am, I have got through in a few minutes. When I try at 2pm for afternoon appointments, this does take longer to get through. It just rings and rings and rings. No message to say you are '? in the queue' or anything, very frustrating. I end up re-ringing and pressing '5', which is the option to speak to a receptionist (opposed to option '1' which is for appointments)."
Bridge,Much better system,1/24/2019,4,"I have found the new appointment system good.  Can get one much quicker.  At 2 pm too we have been able to get an appointment for the afternoon. We see the same GP too, especially for my child with a ongoing condition and who likes a familiar person.  It does not bother me for myself but it is important for my child."
Bridge,My Doctor is excellent,1/5/2018,4,"My Doctor is excellent, very easy to talk to. They seem to remember details about me which makes the whole experience of going to the practice much better."
Bridge,My experience today signifies A/E problems,9/13/2021,3,"Filled out form online, gave them the benefit of doubt concerning urgency. Told them I would be available next day after applying, or next days after. Form said I would be contacted within 7 days, was satisfied with this.

Then I get mail telling me, they are only doing a same day service, so apply another day. Yet they say on form you might get reply within a week. This is a bad service now, when are we going to revert back to seeing a GP  when we need face to face, booked by phone or going to surgery, instead of this ridiculous form filling, which is traumatic for pensioners living alone, without family. Everybody are treated the same with this system, which as I say is frightening for old people No wonder hospital A/E is so overworked.  This must be changed. 

Also bring back having your own registered doctor, instead of seeing all doctors. At moment, you never see your own registered Dr. which obviously doesn't know your problems. It is frightening now to be aged, and have health problems. We must change this.

Also receptionists are no longer friendly in their manner. They treat you on the phone like lesser mortals, and mostly are arrogant in conversation."
Bridge,My friend needs life saving insuline,12/5/2022,1,My friend needs  insuline due to diabetes....they have stopped his prescription...and given him a date in the future when he can reorder new prescription...he currently only has a couple of days supply... But they wont let him order even though hes almost out of insulin... he is housebound...very poor health...it is impossible to get an appointment at surgery
Bridge,My GTN spray was OOD,2/8/2021,5,"After being advised to call 999, I asked them for a repeat prescription  I assured them my BP was normal, no pains, my breathing was fine I just needed to update GTN"
Bridge,Nearly impossible to get an appointment,1/17/2022,3,If you phone to get an appointment they now tell you to go online to fill out what I consider a difficult to find form to be told there aren’t any appointments
Bridge,Need clear indication on what GP you see,6/5/2018,3,"When you check in on the screen, it does not say what GP you are seeing. I do not feel this is very good and would prefer to know the name of the GP in advance."
Bridge,New telephone system is poor but staff lovely,5/16/2019,4,We find all the staff lovely here. However we do find the new system for calling 'on the day' terrible. So many people queue at the door the staff can't answer the phone. Taken about 30 minutes to get through.
Bridge,No appointments,12/10/2018,3,"Phoned at 2pm for emergency appointment, been in pain for 5 days lower abdomen, waited 15 minutes for phone to be answered to be informed no appointments a triage doctor would call me, how can a doctor say what’s wrong when they cannot examine you. Get this every time you ring up."
Bridge,No appointments,6/19/2018,1,"Day 3 no appointments, still waiting on phone system of over 4 mins yet again, do not care about mental health"
Bridge,no appointments,6/19/2018,2,"With my mental illness, had a relapse, could not get an appointment since introduction of new phone system"
Bridge,Not allowed an appointment?!?,4/22/2022,1,"I have some current health issues which I need to speak to my GP about. With the continuity of care  duty, and having a named GP, I have been attempting to speak to her to discuss my situation.
I had a CT Scan a few weeks ago, and was not informed of the result - Last week I actually called the hospital to check if the results had been sent, just to be told the results had been sent to my GP some time ago.
So, having heard this, I called the surgery to get an appointment to speak to my named GP (who had ordered the CT Scan following an appointment - that was another nightmare to get, but that's another story!
I called my surgery the Thursday before Easter to request an appointment and I was told my GP was not in but would return on the Wednesday following Easter. The receptionist barked that I had to do an online request for an appointment Wednesday morning at the 8am battle!! Oh joy!
Wednesday came and I got through on the website, but quickly received a message back saying that although my GP is working she would be undertaking home visits so would not be calling me. I then called the surgery and was then questioned about why I wanted to speak to a particular GP (its my right to speak to my own named GP especially when she is dealing with my current health issues). I was told that I would need to request an appointment (via running the 8am online gauntlet) the following day, which I did. Later  that same day I received a further message from the surgery saying that my CT scan result was normal and that if I wanted to speak to a clinician then I would need to make another appointment on another day. 
Thursday came, I did the online request asking for an appointment with my GP...... I received a message saying that although my GP was working she was not available due to a change in normal work schedule. If I wanted to speak to her then I would need to request an appointment on another day!!! 
Feeling like I am being blocked from speaking to my GP I decided to complain. The website has a poor version of a complaints procedure so I called the surgery to ask for a copy of the full complaints procedure. The receptionist seemed flustered but took my email address stating it would be sent by another staff member either that afternoon or first thing Friday morning...... Nothing received. 
I have a severe lack of trust in the reception staff and want to be able to make my complaint directly to the practice manager, but can't obtain contact details for him either. 
I just want to speak to my GP to discuss next my health issues. Is that too much to ask????? 
Just to finish, I have a really good GP and am happy with the service I have received up to this point. I wonder if my request for an appointment even reached my GP."
Bridge,Not easy to access,2/11/2022,3,I find the service difficult to access with work. You need to see someone and could do with being able to book a few days ahead when you work. It is difficult to access for this reason and disproportionately affects those who work. In today as boss knew I had been trying a few times to get an appointment.
Bridge,Not straight forward !!!,4/27/2021,2,I know my way around laptops etc. but this website sends you round in circles!!!! They want everyone to use this method to access the services and won’t let you book a doctors appointment - Please make it simpler!!!!!!! I’m very happy with my practice but not their website!!!!
Bridge,Not willing to help,1/18/2023,1,"Not willing to help even when urgent, send you away even when your getting worsen don’t care about your health it’s an absolute disgrace."
Bridge,Nurse appointments on the day are fine,9/17/2019,4,"I find the 'on the day' system fine for me, You can get advance appointments with nurses but not GPs.
I am always happy to see a nurse, but unsure if I had need for a GP how long it would be before I got through and whether there would be any appointments available for me."
Bridge,Old system wasn't good at all,6/5/2018,3,Last week I called 6 times (noted on my mobile) to get an appointment. Hopefully the new system will help that. I saw their communications on Facebook
Bridge,"On the day OK if I'm ill, but not for checkups",9/17/2019,4,"Got used to the calling on the day system. Works OK if I am ill on the day, but when I need a check up and want to see my own GP it is more difficult. I now know of the weekend surgeries and may use those now."
Bridge,Ongoing treatment,2/11/2022,4,"I have access ongoing here as I have had a transplant recently. I call on the day early and as my access is crucial to my ongoing health, I always get in for a face-to-face appointment. I just stick my phone on speaker when calling. It is not too long a wait though."
Bridge,Online appointments booking is down.,4/25/2023,1,"Not possible to make online appointments but when phoning the practice, the recorded message says that the best way to make an appointment is online. Very frustrating to get such conflicting messages.
Also, the front page on the Bridge Road Practice website has a message about ""How to stay cool during the heatwave. This message has been there since last summer. This message should be deleted and replaced by a message that tells you how to make an appointment when the online system is not working,"
Bridge,Online booking is not working,5/26/2021,1,"In the last month, both myself and my wife have tried to make appointments to see a GP. The online system said we would be contacted by a nurse and on both occasions we were left with no response. This is not acceptable by any metric, clearly there is no performance monitoring or follow up being practised."
Bridge,Online services easier to use than phone,9/17/2019,5,"Asked to see the same GP every 5 weeks but been unable to book advance appointments. It had been a problem calling 'on the day' however we have now got ourselves 'online' and it has been much easier. We've been given the information on the says our GP works and found it easier to book.
We have learned of the prebookable weekend appointments available at this surgery too which is of interest."
Bridge,Overall fine,10/1/2020,4,"Yes it can take a while to get through on the telephone and since having to order my prescription on the telephone that is more waiting to get what you need.  It can be frustrating, but most of the time you get what you need to get that day.  My appointment is running quite behind today, but again 'it happens'.  If I need extra time they do tend to run over, so I am sure there is good reason for it."
Bridge,Overall good,5/16/2019,4,"Overall a good surgery. One thing I feel they should consider is that if the GP asks to see you in a week, that the GP can book you in or give you a card to give to reception so that they know it's OK to do that. Rather than having to remember in a weeks time that you have to call."
Bridge,Phone system,2/13/2019,3,"It takes ages to answer the telephone, so it never seems like there are enough people answering it when they know the demand will be high."
Bridge,Phone system needs more indication,6/5/2018,3,Calling at 8am and not getting through is frustrating. Have the system where you know where you are in the queue would be better.
Bridge,POD use,10/1/2020,4,"Since now having to use the POD (prescription ordering direct), getting my 'repeat' can be difficult as it takes ages to get through on the telephone. I cannot go 'online' so have to use the telephone. I am a patient person, but 20 minutes waiting on the telephone to order a repeat is for me just frustrating."
Bridge,Pointless being registered,11/4/2023,1,Been trying for 4 working weeks to be seen for antibiotics for an infection. Every day I fill a form in or call to be told it's fully booked try again tomorrow!! It's pointless being registered to this surgery as you can't even see anyone. Again I'll be wasting A&E time to be seen for a simple prescription for antibiotics. Pathetic
Bridge,"poor, no care, palmed off",3/1/2023,2,"disappointed left the call in tears, my ear is in agony a doctor calls to tell me to get a spray without having seen the inside of my ear."
Bridge,Pre-arranged appointment ok,10/1/2020,3,"I find it really difficult to get an 'on the day' appointment. I have got very frustrated as I have tried online too, only to see that none are available, yet I ring first thing in the morning and once I get through, there no appointments then either. Today is an advanced appointment made every couple of weeks, which is all set out by them, so it is fine."
Bridge,Prefer the system,2/13/2019,4,"The surgery is much better with the 'on the day' appointments.  It is sometimes difficult on the telephone.  I raised it with them that I went from 29th to 4th in the queue then was cut off.  I got an apology which is good, I felt they handled it well, and because of this I know if I had an issue I would feel fine talking to them again."
Bridge,Really good,5/24/2021,5,"I find the online appointment system really good, much easier than being on hold for 20/30 minutes when trying to get kids ready for school!"
Bridge,Really good service from the Practice,4/22/2023,5,"I have been a patient of Bridge Road Surgery for over 40 years. There have been several GP's, Nursing Staff etc and Admin staff change over the years.  As time has gone by the Surgery Staff attitudes have changed and they are much more accommdating and kind.  However saying that,  I have never had any issues with BRS, they have always been there for my family and I."
Bridge,Rubbish,1/23/2023,2,How can I fill in a form within a minute of opening and all appointments are gone
Bridge,Rude reception staff,7/10/2022,1,"Booking appointment for flu jab, met by rude, unhelpful member of staff. Wouldn't make an appointment so went elsewhere for jab. Over 75 person"
Bridge,"Rude, uninterested receptionist",4/4/2021,1,Receptionist didn't bother to acknowledge me and when she did interact with me it was with rudeness and disinterest.  Made me feel like a naughty school child who was just a nuisance.  The reception staff desperately need good training in how to interact appropriately with the patients who use this surgery.
Bridge,Running late,4/11/2021,3,It is running late today but not told when you check in that this is the case. I have another appointment after this so would be good to know so can ring them
Bridge,Same day appointments for the employed??,7/23/2018,3,"The same day appointment system simply doesn't for people who are employed. I called as soon as they opened to get an early appointment. Waited for 20minutes as no one answered. Was late for work. I work in a different town so I have to have early or late appointments (not random middle of the day times) after being told all the morning appointments were gone I had to agree to an afternoon appointment... meaning I was late for work AND I had to leave early too! My boss was not happy!

We have to give our managers notice of absence... I was late on the off chance I MIGHT get an appointment! this does not work for employed people!"
Bridge,Same day referral service is not ideal,7/25/2022,2,"When ever I need to contact Bridge Road to make an appointment online, I am finding that if you do not complete the form at 8 in the morning, I get a message stating that they are full for today. On one occasion I got this message at 8 am? I feel that the same day GP appointment system is more convenient for the GP's rather than the patients. 
It is so difficult to get an appointment at this surgery, the online messaging service says full, then you try to call and are on hold for 30 minutes, it is so frustrating. When you do eventually get an appointment, it is usually be telephone, and no time is given for the appointment, not ideal for people who are working, or may need to be in a place to speak privately on the consultation. 
Also when my consultant wrote to my GP to ask them to prescribe some medication for me, it was not responded to, I read the letter myself on my NHS app, it clearly stated the instructions, but this was ignored and never was prescribed."
Bridge,See nurses more now,5/9/2018,4,"I have noticed a real shift to seeing Nurse Practitioners. I am a nurse myself and do realise that in some cases this is appropriate, but I do feel I need to see a GP with my child for 'reassurance'. I have asked to see a GP instead on 2 occasions and I was refused by the receptionist. I am also not sure if I even have an allocated GP anymore."
Bridge,See same GP,2/14/2019,4,"I have found the new appointment system good.  We have been able to get an appointment when we call in the morning, but also when we have had to call at 2 pm too.  We see the same GP too for my child with and ongoing condition which is important."
Bridge,Seeing my own GP can be difficult,6/5/2018,3,My GP only works 2 days so calling on the day may mean I never get to see them. I only get to see them now as I can book in advance.
Bridge,Seeing own doctor difficult,5/8/2016,4,"This is a good service overall. However, sometimes you just want to see your own assigned doctor but it is almost impossible, you have to wait for a few weeks if you do and most of the time that is just too long."
Bridge,Send an image to the practice.,1/18/2022,1,"I was asked to send a an image to the practice regarding something that I am concerned about medically. asked the practice a question. where do I upload the image on their site, the usual reply came back their are no appointments the surgery is fully booked...I DONT WANT AN appointment.. Some help with uploading an image is al I was this seems to be the standard response whenever you ask a question after 11:00am."
Bridge,So frustrating when nobody answers the phone,10/18/2018,3,"I've needed to book an appointment twice recently and both times it's been so frustrating to try and get through on the phone! 
The first time I needed an appointment first thing on a Monday morning, so I rang as soon as the surgery opened at 8am and eventually got to speak to someone at 8:20. 
This time, I tried ringing at around 8:15 and I've now given up trying to get through. I thought it would be a quick and easy job to do before work but apparently not.
The surgery itself is always running behind. My last appointment was for 9:20 and I eventually got to see the doctor at 10:10. The doctors and nurses themselves are always helpful, it's just a shame about how the surgery is run."
Bridge,So kind,10/1/2020,5,"I have found with my ongoing needs to come here quite regularly, they are so kind and looked after me at this difficult time really well.
Every surgery has their difficulties as there is a high need, but I just find them very professional and they just 'get on with it' in difficult circumstances.  They never complain."
Bridge,Son passed off as viral,6/19/2021,1,"On 2 occasions my at the time 7 month old boy was taken to the doctors on 3 occasions with trouble breathing wheezing and a cough to be told 3 times its viral and will clear itself, on the saturday we were taken to james paget and told he had a chest infection and bronchitis and that they could not believe we had been sent away 3 times previous, the doctor was so concerned he was going to keep my little boy in overnight for observations but gave us a chance to take him home and start the steriods and anti-biotics, but left a bed available for that night if we had concerns. 

Then the second time, my son is now 2, we took him back for a continuous chesty cough not eating or drinking and very sleepy and constant temp of 38+ told again it was viral and his body will fight it - any concerns go back, ended up down james paget later that evening 10:30pm to be told he has bacterial tonsillitis. The doctor at the surgery didn't even check his throat. Another course of anti-biotics and a missed chance to actually correctly diagnose my son again. While I appreciate its busy, and times are hard, but to incorrectly diagnose on 2 occasion is not acceptable."
Bridge,Spotless,11/13/2021,5,"Doctor really pleasant and friendly. Waiting area, doctor’s room and toilet were sparkling clean."
Bridge,System and timing could be improved,6/5/2018,3,They just do not have the time to explain everything. When you get to see the GP everything is fine. Getting through in the morning is difficult. Knowing where you are in the queue would be good.
Bridge,Systems and admin need improvement,6/5/2018,4,"Called at 8am one day and earliest i could be seen was in 3 weeks. I felt I needed to see someone on the day as I had already been ill for more than 2 weeks. I know they are changing the phone system but I do not understand having more people on the telephone makes much more difference. If there are no appointments left, there are no appointments left. Putting more people on the telephone will just mean that you get the same answer earlier in the day."
Bridge,Thankfully I am not a service user .,6/8/2021,1,"I have elderly relatives who need primary health care but the level of service they have received is appalling. You need to be IT literate , the website is very difficult to navigate if you have a visual impairment. The information is negative and lists all the reasons why you should not use the service. You are expected to diagnose yourself. Reception staff need training."
Bridge,The practice no longer offers routine GP appointments,8/23/2022,1,I telephoned the practice to arrange a routine follow up appointment with a GP to discuss complex issues. The receptionist told me that the practice only give routine appointments with nurse for dressing changes and similar issues. They do not give an appointment with a GP.
Bridge,Too difficult to get an appointment,9/24/2018,2,I can't get an appointment !
Bridge,Too many patients but truly caring staff,7/22/2020,4,"I have always found the doctors here to be amazing.  Drs are such gentle souls.  There was a locus who was clearly intelligent but so human and down to Earth - quite refreshing. Practice Manager is such a well-meaning and caring person; nurses are truly salt of the Earth. One is highly caring and relatable, insightful with diagnoses, Another seems to know as much as a Doctor and is so empathetic, and the other is pragmatic with diagnoses and treatment down to a T.  A truly wonderful staff - the site is always well maintained, very clean indeed (well done cleaning staff) and the receptionist team are a friendly, human and caring bunch."
Bridge,Triage works well,2/14/2019,4,I usually ring later in the day if I need to access the service and I find that the afternoon Triage appointment system works well.  Things do however tend to run more than 15-20 min late which is why I have put 3* for the waiting times.
Bridge,trying to get an appointment  very difficult,5/26/2021,2,"The on-line booking system is not fit for purpose. however, once finally getting to see a doctor service is good. Response to tests via messages from receptionists leads to incomplete and misleading information given and then one has to revert to the on-line booking system!"
Bridge,Unable to get appointment,9/8/2022,1,"Shocking service and very unhelpful staff. I have been trying to get an advice call for days now, sign posted to website, however footfall forms all turned off so unable to request appointment and this was at 08.02am, message states all appointments booked. When calling the practice the message advises patients to log onto website, which is very un helpful when you have closed your footfall forms, also when speaking to receptionists they advise to use website when they know full well patients cant access this. I think practice needs to look  at its processes and business continuity plan."
Bridge,Unable to request routine appointment,6/1/2023,1,You cannot request appointments out of hours and when you request one during working hours they are always fully booked. You can request an appointment at anytime with another Surgery.
Bridge,"Useless system, unable to book appointment",8/13/2021,1,Booking must be online for that day ONLY. The system closes as soon as it is full (around 9am). I am trying to book an annual consultation. Why can't the online appointment request system function as an 24/7 inbox for a response? It has been designed around immediate emergencies ONLY not ongoing conditions or a responsive service. In desperation I spoke to the reception & was encouraged to submit a formal complaint for change.
Bridge,Very difficult to make non urgent request,6/3/2023,1,"Needing to get referral to audio clinic for aged parent in order to get their hearing aid repaired / updated. Sent message from website, told it was the wrong route. Took their suggested route, told it was shut as all appointments today are full."
Bridge,Very difficult to see a doctor now.,11/4/2018,2,"Family members have been needing to see a doctor, but it's very difficult to even get an appointment with the nurse practitioners that they use now. What has happened to this surgery? The doctors are absolutely fantastic but you cannot get to see one."
Bridge,Very good,2/14/2019,5,"When I called first thing today, I was 9th in the queue. I got through quickly after answering a couple of questions, which I do not mind and as a result I am seeing a GP of my own choice.  So from my own personal experience, this to me is very good."
Bridge,Very good allround,2/21/2017,4,Doctor been really good at advising me about my continual nose bleeds.  They said if they continue I need to get nose cauterised.  At A & E for this.  Ambulance came and picked me up within half an hour to bring me.  Very good allround
Bridge,Very poor,6/14/2021,1,"My mum had seen an A & E doctor in a different area with what could be, he thought, potentially very serious symptoms. We were told to ensure we saw her local GP URGENTLY, and the doctor followed this up with a letter/email to my mums surgery, which I also emailed to the receptionist that day. Three days later, my sister snd I have called the surgery four times and still my mum hasn’t even received a phone call from a doctor. Disgusting."
Bridge,Very poor access to service,5/16/2019,3,"I find getting through on the telephone difficult, I phones 3 days on the trot so on the 4th I walked into surgery. Reception staff directed me to complain then the management of the surgery might listen to the problems."
Bridge,Very vigilant,9/17/2019,5,"Been excellent with my ongoing needs of regular appointments.
I receive quick referrals when needed ('an urgent case') linked with cancer treatment.
Very vigilant."
Bridge,Visually impaired patient,4/25/2016,4,I am not aided into my appointments. I need someone with me all the time as I am totally blind and this can prove difficult.
Bridge,Walk-in,2/11/2022,4,"Phone calls cost too much, so I walk in to the surgery to get an appointment. I saw a Pharmacist in Haydens today who sent me into the surgery to see someone as they couldn't deal with it themselves. I do always try the Pharmacy first. They have got me in instantly, which is really good."
Bridge,Was really efficient,3/3/2021,5,"I booked online to speak to Dr Niem,  he got in touch within 2hours and was really helpful at helping me"
Bungay,A good very surgery,3/4/2023,5,"I have to say that the surgery have been incredibly supportive to me since my husbands health issues, and I'm not sure where I would have been without them. This is a very good GP surgery. Getting an appointment by phone is fine, even though you have to wait a while to get through sometimes, I have always managed to get a face to face appointment when needed. I did have a telephone appointment with the doctor and that went fine and they did ask me to go in. I have found the staff's attitude to be generally very good and I find them to be proactive."
Bungay,A medical factory,7/2/2019,2,"Everyone is pushing things down to the GPs - can't get enough of them around here and I don't know why, they get a good enough salary. I would give this surgery a 3 out of 10. A lot of the GPs don't work full time, the doctor doesn't know you or your mental state it's just all on a computer. Appalled that you can only get a health check from 60 to 75. The GP didn't tell me that I had a health check, I had to chase them for it every year. Because they're run as a business it's just turned into a medical factory."
Bungay,A strained service but no issues,8/11/2018,4,We have never had any issues.  Been very prompt with illnesses within our family.  Everyone is very polite and friendly.  Generally they are incredibly overworked and strained across the board.
Bungay,Access difficult,7/12/2018,2,Being able to access appointments is difficult. I called and was told I had been put on the 'triage' list. 4 hours later I had to call again as I'd not heard anything. They then booked me in for urgent appointment and from that went to hospital.
Bungay,All round amazing service for all the family,7/11/2019,5,I have always experienced amazing service from Bungay surgery and all members of the family have been seen by various grades of staff. Tonight my daughter suffered a minor injury from a dog bite and we were seen within 5 mins of making the phone call and a course of medicine prescribed.  Cannot thank the staff enough.
Bungay,Always able to obtain an appointment .,7/11/2018,5,"When I have needed urgent help,the practice has always found time to see me."
Bungay,Always helpful,2/4/2019,5,I’ve lived in Bungay for 30 years and I’ve not had a problem with the surgery. Sometimes systems they have tried haven’t always worked out but they seem quick to correct it. The receptionists are always very friendly and helpful and always do their best to accommodate you
Bungay,Always seen when it is important,2/9/2018,5,"A very good practice, with high mental and emotional care."
Bungay,Always treated with Dignity and Respect,2/12/2018,5,.
Bungay,Appointment issues,3/17/2016,5,The way you book appointments needs to be improved. Not everyone can do this on a computer.
Bungay,Appointment issues,3/17/2016,5,The staff are not at all helpful and just do not talk respectfully to you when you are trying to get an appointment. It is not acceptable to have to wait 4 weeks to see a doctor.
Bungay,Appointment system,7/12/2018,4,"I prefer the system now that you can book routine advanced appointments with the GP or your choice. I do not mind seeing a nurse, nurse practitioner or not my doctor when I need someone on the day. The system used to be 'on the day' only and I found that more difficult."
Bungay,Appointments often over 30mins late,8/11/2019,4,"Appointments often over 30 mins late. I prefer to see my own doctor, but it happens rarely. I just find it difficult to repeat issues, they just read off a screen. The staff are kind and caring."
Bungay,At times rude,8/11/2018,3,Some doctors can be very rude at times as can the receptionists.  I feel rushed and not listened to at times.  Trying to get an appointment is very difficult.
Bungay,Booking appointments,6/15/2023,4,I have always had excellent service from this practice with regards to being seen quickly for myself or my children. I was particularly impressed with the online service. I filled out a simple form last night and by 8am this morning I had a text with an appointment in a few days time. No waiting on the phone in a queue. Really easy and great service.
Bungay,Can be dismissive,8/11/2018,4,Only issue is with trying to make an appointment.  Sometimes receptionists are dismissive and unhelpful
Bungay,Can't get seen by anyone.,7/5/2023,1,Bad knee pain and swelling came on just over a week ago for no apparent reason. Phoned on Monday 3rd to try and see a Dr or a nurse. Told can't see either but can have a phone call on Wednesday 5th from a physio. Wednesday I get a call to say no physio available so no call today but can have one next week or if I want one to look at my knee it will be 17th in Beccles. I have no idea if it is a mild but painful condition that will clear up on it's own using aspirin and volterol or if it's a sign of anything more serious that needs further treatment. Waiting two weeks to get anyone to look at it for even two minutes is a very poor level of service. My dog get better from the Vet. It's a pity they can't see me either.
Bungay,Communication lacking,8/11/2018,4,"They are running 40 minutes late today.  They need to communicate it to patients.  Staff need to do better at that.  The HWS CDO explained that the home visits had ran over, due to emergencies.  Once we knew this we feel we can forgive it.  It should be communicated as people will understand when these things happen.  Saying nothing just winds you up."
Bungay,Communication with Deaf,12/10/2022,3,"The way to book appointments on the day is difficult as we need to get an interpreter on our phone on a whatsapp and at short notice this can be difficult. No notice about them running behind, so you do worry that you may have missed your appointment as you cannot hear if you are called. The clinician does come out to get us, but you can miss them and if you need the Loo, again you worry you have missed them, but we cannot ring down to reception and ask."
Bungay,Delays today,12/10/2022,4,"I always get what I need from the service. Today I called and I am being seen as an 'emergency' on the same day. There are delays today, and currently I have been waiting more than 40 minutes past my appointment time."
Bungay,Diagnosed before seeing me,8/2/2019,1,"Wasn't told i was seeing a nurse not a gp, the nurse said she was sorry I thought I was unwell but I have a virus even though I had explained I'd had symptoms over a week and lost my voice last week and was now producing green mucous, indicative of an infection, i was told it was a virus again and a steroid nasal spray would clear it up. In my opinion she had diagnosed me before i'd entered the room. I asked about my throat as i had lost my voice over a week ago but it was only sore the first day but i still havent got my voice back, she checked my throat and said there was no pus on my tonsils so it was fine!"
Bungay,Different time this time,12/10/2022,5,"I have regular appointments for my bag to be change (colostomy) and they are made a month at a time, weekly. The time this week was different which I hadn't realised, so almost missed it! Hospital looks after me too, seeing me every 3 months."
Bungay,"Doctors/nurses lovely, receptionists are not",8/25/2020,2,"The receptionists are always rude, I’m yet to have an encounter with a friendly one. I’m regularly made to feel stupid or like an inconvenience."
Bungay,Drop-in blood test clinic,1/17/2019,5,My intermediate diabetes blood test requirement (non-fasting for diet-controlled diabetics) was via the drop-in clinic. There were about 10 patients in front of me and I had to wait for about 40 minutes. I consider this quite acceptable. I was aware of a few older men waiting after me who obviously did not and I politely said so.
Bungay,Easy to get on the day appointments,2/5/2019,5,"We get appointments easily on the day, which is great with having a child. We find the 'P.O.D.' excellent too, although remembering 7 days in advance can be challenging. It is just a case of getting used to it."
Bungay,Excellent,8/11/2019,5,"Have been excellent for both myself and my partner. We are both in for blood tests today.
I also have to have blood tests at James Paget (under cancer services). Really wish I could just have them here as it would be much more convenient. I have them 2 weeks apart, so quite a regular check."
Bungay,Excellent but keep people informed,9/21/2017,5,"Excellent, but if they are running a few minute late it would really helpful if people waiting are kept informed."
Bungay,Excellent service,2/5/2019,4,Excellent services. Getting here can be difficult as bus services is not regular. We have used BACT a few times who are excellent.
Bungay,Exceptional,8/16/2021,5,"We have recently moved to the area and both my wife and I have had occasion to use the practice. What a revelation! We have been patients at a practice in mid-Suffolk previously and near Cambridge prior to that. The mid-Suffolk experience was average to poor and consequently we thought nothing in Suffolk could top the Cambridge service. We were wrong. This surgery delivers exceptional service relative to our experience and those of our friends and family who are spread across the country. Same day appointments, callbacks within the hour from nurse practitioners and physios, timely follow-up calls (unheard of elsewhere) and friendly reception staff and pharmacists, all these things are delivered consistently. Trust me, this is not the norm elsewhere.  Well done to everyone there, we are very pleased to be able to call on such a comprehensive and caring service."
Bungay,Find staff rude,7/12/2018,4,"Thing could be improved for me if staff were just a bit less rude. I try and be polite when I call as it is not often I need to see a GP, but when I do, I do not want to be questioned over it. The worried few have made things more difficult for the majority who only ever see a GP in urgent situations. When you have a family and need a GP appointment it can be stressful as the system puts you on tenderhooks whilst waiting for the 'call back'. You cannot get on with your day until you get that call."
Bungay,Get appointments when we need them,2/5/2019,5,Get appointments when we need them. We regularly see the person to check hearing aids.
Bungay,Getting prescriptions difficult,3/17/2016,5,"I am an elderly person with no transport, and so it is not possible for me to just 'pop down to the pharmacy to collect my prescription'. The staff are lovely."
Bungay,Glad to be registered at Bungay,6/8/2018,5,Appointment choice is so much better than my old practice.  Trained nurses are lovely and receptionists are helpful.  Thank you all
Bungay,Good,2/5/2019,4,Good
Bungay,Good,7/3/2019,4,"All staff are always friendly, personable and professional.  Good explanations about how to book appointments, about treatments available and options."
Bungay,Good follow ups,3/4/2023,5,"I think they do well at this surgery, far better than at my last surgery which was not in this county. I find that they follow up well after an appointment and they have refered me over to the physio team which went well for me. I think the GP's are very good and the nurse and admin staff all are very good attitude. The onsite pharmacy have made a couple of hiccups but on the whole I feel very pleased to be with them."
Bungay,Got an 'on the day' appointment,8/11/2019,4,"Called this morning and got an 'on the day' appointment with a GP, which I am pleased about, and can ask no more.
Receptionists are professional and I understand why they ask extra questions. Just running over 20mins (so far) late today, but I expect it."
Bungay,Great overall service,3/17/2016,5,I find the staff very friendly here. When I went into hospital I received a call once I was home and a visit as I have heart problems. My prescriptions thankfully are always on time.
Bungay,Hard to get appointments,3/17/2016,4,"It is hard to get an appointment on a Monday mainly. But ok rest of the week. When you do have an appointment you do not get seen on time. They do have signs up saying if you have not been seen in 20 minutes make reception aware, and if upstairs you can call down too."
Bungay,Helpful and polite,8/11/2018,5,Overall we have found the surgery very helpful and polite. On occasion there has been a couple of receptionists who have been very short bordering on being rude.
Bungay,Impressed,3/17/2022,5,"Footfall query submitted at 13:38, update from practice at 14:09, call for a telephone consultation at 14:11. Cannot ask for more than that!  Thank you BMP"
Bungay,it's not like it used to be,3/4/2023,4,"I find that you cannot get to see the doctor as easily as you used to be able to, but I don't suppose it will ever be like it used to be. I remember when we used to have a family doctor and they used to know us well but you do not get that kind of consistency anymore and I think communication could be better from the surgery with things like getting medication reviews."
Bungay,Just feels awkward,8/11/2018,4,"It is very awkward sharing my symptoms with a receptionist in order to get an appointment.  I am not comfortable with it and it does not really work, as I know if I need to see someone but will not feel comfortable disclosing my full symptoms which can result in not being offered an appointment."
Bungay,Late order prescription,5/2/2019,5,"I realised I had run out of some medication and ordered over the weekend, the practice dispensary were brilliant in getting me the medication at short notice."
Bungay,Long delays and conflicting info from staff.,5/10/2018,3,Very often long delays for appointments. Staff give conflicting information when you speak to different staff members. Everything about the practice seems to be slow.
Bungay,Lots of changes since I've been coming here,8/11/2019,3,"The surgery has changed a lot in the 25 years I have been coming here. I do not know who my GP is since my previous one left. Getting through receptionists can be difficult and I find them quite rude,   Appointments 'always' run late. Not sure what has happened, but it is quite stressful."
Bungay,no adjustment for Deaf patients,2/10/2020,1,They refuse to get BSL Interpreters for Deaf patients who use British Sign Language. They refuse to note our requirements despite the Accessible Information Standards stating a patient's preferences should be flagged up. Staff don’t understand BSL.  Doctor themself has actually been ringing Deaf patients to make a voice call. Unbelievable.  They refuse to adjust at all.  Years and years of requests ignored.   Lack of equal access to our healthcare
Bungay,no proactive appointments ring back later!!!,1/2/2021,1,You call for a non urgent appointment after the busy period to spread the load on the reception to be told sorry today's appointments have all gone ring back at 8 tomorrow!  But I don't want to put in a long queue and don't need an appointment that day just book me one later in the week or so? Madness you cant book a future appointment not on the same day.
Bungay,Not always helpful,3/17/2016,3,"I just find that there is lack of understanding of problems that an elderly person living alone faces. Mobility being the main issue, so things are not easy."
Bungay,Nursing staff are extremely rude,8/2/2019,1,"Nursing staff lack duty of care and are extremely rude, they talk down to you in a derogatory fashion and fail to listen to any problems you may be having and are not willing to help with issues, they are quick to become dismissive and rude an they make me feel as though I am intimidated"
Bungay,On the day appointment,7/12/2018,3,"Getting an 'on the day' appointment is very difficult and when you do you wait more than 30 minutes (today its 40 minutes). In the past I have used the phone upstairs as there is a message up saying 'call if more than 20 minutes wait', but reception are so rude about it, so I do not do that anymore. So I do not see the point of having the sign up, if they are just going to be horrible about it.
We are overrun at this surgery and my understanding is that only one GP covers 'on the day' appointments when we have 5 full time ones, I feel that the balance is not there."
Bungay,Online systems not great,2/5/2019,3,"In for an annual blood test that they contacted me about. I would like to use the on line system to book appointments but it was not great. I have not yet needed to book but I just do not like using the telephone. 
You used to be able to give in your repeat prescriptions but unable to now, this is not a great system for my elderly father to use."
Bungay,Only 'on the day',12/10/2022,3,"If you call in, they only offer on the day appointments, which is difficult when you work. You cannot at short notice take time off in my job."
Bungay,Only scoring a 3 because of second encounter,3/22/2021,3,"I was advised by a nurse practitioner that needed to complete a urine sample on Monday morning, I arrived at 8am and came in to reception, nobody was at the desk, I waited for some time and then rang the doorbell next to reception. I could see and hear lots of staff in the room behind reception but nobody came. I waited a while longer and then pressed it again. After a wait a woman with brown hair came storming into reception, I said ‘hello I am here to do a urine sample’, she opened the glass divider and said ‘sorry?’ In a moody tone. I repeated myself and she grabbed a sample pot and bag and handed it to me saying ‘when you are done, put it collection point by the door’.
She was about to walk away, when I asked ‘sorry where are the toilets?’
Through those double doors is all she said.
I walked towards the only double doors that I could see, which suggested it was private access but there was no way I wanted to ask her again! I came to an unlit hallway and had to turn my phone torch on to find the toilet on the right. When I returned to reception I looked for the specimen collection point by the door but couldn’t see it anywhere.
I had also realised that there was no information on the sample pot to say that it was mine, I pressed the doorbell again, this time a lovely young lady came to reception, I asked her how I add my details to the pot and where I should put it, she very helpfully passed me a sticker and a pen and explained what information I needed to add. She also handed me a basket from behind reception for me to put my sample in.
Both of those things needed to happen in order for my sample to actually get somewhere. Had I just done what the First Lady had said then I would have ended up putting an unlabelled specimen possibly in a newspaper rack by the door!
I am a nurse myself, so I know the standards we should be meeting in the NHS. This didn’t come close to meeting them. Had I have been elderly or disabled, I may have had an accident in that dark hallway. I understand it was early, but the first thing you do is turn the lights on when you start a shift?"
Bungay,Overall a very good surgery,8/11/2019,5,"Overall a very good surgery. Usually run behind, but I understand the pressures they are under. Receptionists - some can be a bit brusk."
Bungay,Overall not bad,3/17/2016,3,I just find the appointments system is an issue for me. It is hard to get one on the day and you just end up giving up.
Bungay,Positive experience at Bungay Medical Practice,9/21/2022,5,"I have been using this surgery for about a year and a half since moving to the area. I am really pleased that I always manage to get through to the surgery quickly on the phone and I have been able to secure an appointment when needed. My baby is always seen the same day and when I have called for myself I have always received a telephone appointment if I can’t be seen face to face. 
I feel lucky that I am able to speak to receptionists quickly and seen by the Drs in a reasonable time.
I know this is not always the case at other drs surgeries."
Bungay,Prescription can take too long,3/17/2016,3,My warden takes my prescription but the processing takes too long. I do have to chase it often and it can take up to two weeks to come. It is also hard to make an appointment
Bungay,Put through hoops at this surgery,10/14/2021,1,"Unable to get a face to face appointment with GP despite being cross questioned by receptionist. I am elderly and have a number of conditions, even a routine appointment I was only able to get a telephone appointment six weeks forward. Then I never got the call. I have spoken to the [surgery] with the  concern that things will be missed with only telephone calls. After having spoken to NHE it seems each surgery makes their own decisions on how they run their service. The example I have given is just one. My overall impression now is that I no longer have trust that I will get individual care."
Bungay,Rarely see my own doctor,3/17/2016,4,"It is difficult to get an appointment and when you do, it is rare you see your own doctor. It is becoming more and more like that and probably inevitable. We patients do not like it, but what can we do."
Bungay,Reception variable,3/17/2016,5,In the main the surgery is great. I just find it can vary with reception staff. They are not as understanding as the doctors themselves. Just a bit of empathy in the voice would make a difference.
Bungay,"Receptionists rude, surgery unorganised",4/26/2021,1,"As my first surgery growing up, my experiences have made me extremely anxious about going to the doctors. The first time I called to make my own doctors appointment (a nervous thing in itself), I was given the earliest appointment, but as I was visiting my grandparents and had to get a bus there (my grandfather had cancer and could no longer drive) I asked for a slightly later appointment, this was met with a rude patronising response of ""are you aware there is a doctors surgery in Halesworth Miss..... "" and was made to feel bad about my request.

I got an appointment slightly later that I had to run for. I wish I could say this is the only time they were rude to me but it wasn't, and each time you're essentially gaslighted into thinking you're not really ill. Appointments are never on time. I order to pick up my contraceptive pill, after placing the request the correct time in advance, I had to go between the surgery dispensary and the boots 4 times, each time waiting in a long queue, each time saying the other dispensary had it."
Bungay,Ridiculous appointment schemes.,7/5/2021,2,"I have to have 2 appointments - one for an injection and one for a blood test. Previously I had both tasks completed in one appointment. I have now got to travel 6 miles for one of these appointments when my practice is only 2 miles away. While I appreciate practice staff have areas of expertise, it will deskill staff if they are not regularly performing some of the former skills. Also, when you work you cannot keep taking time off to attend different appointments when everything can be conducted at one visit."
Bungay,Rude receptionists,11/19/2018,1,"Receptionists I understand are busy with phone calls but it's part of the job surely! I do not appreciate an unwelcoming, snappy conversation on the phone with a lady who has no idea what issue I may have or what state I may be in. To be told that unless I have a urgent problem that needs seeing to today (what actually classes as an urgent problem!?) I would have to wait 3 weeks for an appointment, I personally think is appalling especially judging by my previous surgeries where you get a same day appointment regardless of issue (the receptionist there wouldn't have the cheek to ask if it was urgent or not!) And if fully booked, you can just call the next day. In this particular occasion with the receptionist I tried to carefully explain that yes, my issue is technically one that is ongoing (and by their rules, would not class as urgent) but before I could explain anything else, I was told I had to take the appointment for 3 weeks time, therefore I felt obliged to explain my very personal and intimate issue in detail, in order for her to understand that my issue may not be urgent such as chest pains etc but still could not wait 3 weeks for an appointment! Still with no sense of care, kindness or even an apology for making me having to explain this all, I was told to call back tomorrow to get a same day appointment.  The job industry these people work in are to give care, where on earth has it disappeared to!"
Bungay,Running behind today,7/12/2018,4,"I've recently moved to this surgery and so far I have been able to get an appointment on the day. Last time I was on the phone for 1.5 hours. Today, my appointment is 40 minutes behind. Trouble is, you just feel grateful to get the appointment so you dare not complain that they are running so late!"
Bungay,same day consultation after 10am,12/12/2019,4,Trying to get a same-day consultation for a resident in the care home is impossible we get the same answers why have we not called in the morning. The answer is very simple residents can become unwell at 1pm.
Bungay,Service above average.,8/11/2019,4,Service above average. When you get to see someone everything is great.
Bungay,Shortage of doctors apparent,3/17/2016,4,I understand there is a shortage of doctors and so regretfully accept that I usually see a doctor I do not know.
Bungay,Smear test,7/4/2019,5,Sensitively done with specific techniques to help me.
Bungay,Team are overall helpful,8/11/2019,4,"I find the team overall helpful and I see who I need to, they always sort the issue out. You have to trust that the person you are booked in with is the right person for your need, and so I have no reason to doubt it."
Bungay,Too quiet,7/12/2018,3,"Once you see someone things are fine. I feel they need to play music/have radio on as the place feels so 'clinical and downstairs you can hear everything reception and patients are saying, so they need to be more mindful of confidentiality. it makes me feel if I need to speak to reception that I need to whisper. 
Keeping people back from reception only works to a point, with the sign saying 'for confidentiality purposes'. You can however, still hear everything. All it does, is block the doorway wen you get just 3 people in the queue. It needs a re-think."
Bungay,Trying to get an appointment is difficult,8/11/2019,4,"Cannot fault the NHS overall as have been treated so well and have had a couple of ops. At the surgery though, trying to get an appointment is difficult. You get offered a callback but no 'time slot', which is difficult when you need to get on with things. Once we missed a call and when I rang to ask them to re-ring me they wouldn't, with 'no, you've missed the chance now'. Do find some GPs are a bit short with you.
My previous GP here, who has left, was excellent, and feel we need more like that.
Locums just do not have the same care for me."
Bungay,Waiting times,3/17/2016,4,"Other than the waiting times for getting an appointment and then when you do get one, you are not seen promptly, this surgery is great."
Bungay,Works for me,2/13/2019,4,"I do not use the service very often, but when I do need an appointment I can get one quite easily on the day."
Bungay,Would give no stars if possible,4/26/2021,1,"I’ve had several issues with the practice myself over the years but this one really tops it. My partner called the surgery during lockdown and asked to speak with a doctor to get some mental health support. The receptionist asked him where he lived to which he gave our address, this followed by her telling him that they could not help as we were outside of their area. A young man calls desperately struggling with his mental health and is told no one can help - just the reason why suicide rates are so so high. I don’t know how they can sleep at night knowing that they put the phone down on him in a time of need."
Bungay,Would like to book ahead,12/10/2022,4,Mostly 'on the day' only appointments. I would like to be able to book in ahead of time when things are not as urgent and I find it silly that the system has gone like this as you can't plan so well like this.

Burlington,A dreadful phone system!,12/1/2022,1,"Here I am sitting on the phone waiting to get through to speak to someone on reception. I have been on the phone for 56 minutes now,  37 of those minutes at the front of the queue, apparently!   A dreadful phone system to navigate and use - needs updating and more staff added, to deal with calls. When I last rang 3 months ago it took me 61 call attempts, over a 6 hour period, to get through. A good service once and if you manage to get through."
Burlington,Always helpful.,8/24/2019,4,Doctors always helpful. Nurse practitioners are always good. Surgery always clean. No issues getting appointments.
Burlington,Appalling treatment to my husband,6/13/2020,1,"I have rang surgery four times to ask for a letter for my husband to say he is in the vulnerable category. Each time I was told it will be in the post. Now after 14 weeks shielding he gets a text saying he does not need to shield he can go out. My husband is 78 and has diabetes, chronic heart and kidney disease, he also suffers from gout and cannot walk much due to constant leg/back pain. But he does not meet the criteria to get a letter that would help us get groceries if I cannot get out. I think this is disgraceful when I know of more able people that get everything handed to them on a plate. We have nothing but trouble with this surgery. He has a letter saying that if he is sick and needs to see a doctor they are supposed to fit him in. Not a chance!! Not worth the paper it is written on. If it were my doctor I would move. Absolutely disgusted with their treatment."
Burlington,Appointments are impossible,8/28/2018,2,"When you get an appointment, you've got a roulette - good GPs and bad GPs both. But the booking system is slow, deliberately obtuse, reads a long disclaimer and set of options before you can book anything, and it is basically fully booked within minutes of each day's opening times.

As it doesn't open until after I need to go to work, and there are NO options for asking for an appointment in the next couple days, this screws me (and others) over regularly."
Burlington,Appointments are very difficult to get,8/24/2019,4,Appointments are very difficult to get here if you don't get it on the day you are told to ring back the next day or ring ill if urgent.
Burlington,Appointments go quickly,4/23/2019,2,"It's difficult to get an appointment, today has been ok but normally if you can't get through until 8.30 all the appointments are gone.No other options are given as often all the call backs are gone too. When you do get an appointment it is normally with a doctor which is good and works well. It would help if you could contact the surgery by app or online rather than just by phone."
Burlington,Attitudes are good,8/24/2019,3,"Doctors and nurses attitudes are good. Receptions staff can sometimes look down on you and ask too many questions. Nurses always run to time, GPs often run late. Access could be better into treatment rooms as I am a wheelchair user."
Burlington,Booking appointments system is diabolical,9/9/2018,1,Appointments can only be booked over the phone or very limited appointments bookable online.  I’m severely Hard of Hearing and at work when online appointments are available
Burlington,Can generally get appointments,4/23/2019,4,"I haven't used the surgery much but I got through this morning and its the best its been for a while and I got an appointment. Generally when you need one you do get one and I don't have any issues. I'm fairly happy to see most of the doctors at the surgery which is ok. If its difficult to get here it can be difficult to get to see the doctor of choice. At the moment there is also no lift available which doesn't help but they do come to see you.  Someone we know was given a parking ticket for overstaying during a medical emergency, it took 6 months and a lot of stress to get it all sorted out."
Burlington,Can get appointment on the day,8/24/2019,4,I can get an appointment on the day which is good. Sometimes you do have to wait to go into the appointment.
Burlington,Cannot book an appointment,10/31/2018,2,You cannot see the same doctor who is treating you for the same problem
Burlington,Cannot get an appointment,8/14/2015,1,I 'phoned over 40 times for an appointment only to be told I should have 'phoned earlier and there were not any appointments available. I had been calling since 8am! The surgery would not give me an appointment in advance so I was stumped. Eventually got an appointment over a week and a half later.
Burlington,Can't pop in to surgery to book,12/19/2018,2,It is very difficult to get through on the phone and you can no longer pop in to the surgery to book an appointment. Appointments run really behind so when you have your appointment they rush you through and have a strict one issue per appointment rule.
Burlington,Continuity has not been great,12/1/2017,4,Continuity with an ongoing health problem has not been great.  I see a different doctor each time and they don't understand what is going on and what medication I've been given
Burlington,Diabetes managed well,4/23/2019,3,"My diabetes is managed really well, mostly I see the same nurse for the appointments and I'm given enough information. I'd like to see the doctor more often and you tend to automatically be given an appointment with a nurse. Sometimes there are no appointments available to see a doctor but you do then get to see a nurse practitioner.  Its difficult to get blood tests and  they do try to encourage you to go to the riverside clinic which is difficult to get to. The staff at the surgery are normally accommodating and try to ensure you get an appointment at the surgery.  The pharmacy works really well and I collect my prescription from morrisons which is good for us."
Burlington,difficult to get on the day appointments,9/22/2016,4,"It is difficult to get ""on the day"" appointments, Start phoning at 8 am and then they have normally all gone"
Burlington,Difficult to get through on phone,4/23/2019,2,"It took 12 attempts this morning to get through before I could even join the queue, I was then held for 10 minutes which is difficult when you are trying to get children ready for school.. Even for routine appointments you have to call on the day which makes it difficult to plan. Reception staff vary, I was told this morning that my child wouldn't have what I thought they had, then I was made to feel guilty about wanting the appointment."
Burlington,Difficult to see a GP,1/8/2018,1,"Very busy surgery, difficult to get appointments to see a GP. GP's are leaving and they are reliant on locums. The nurse I've seen has been excellent but pharmacy staff were very unhelpful and wouldn't sort a prescription out before the holidays and advised me to call 111 to get it sorted out. It really has changed in recent years."
Burlington,Disinterested and uncaring,10/23/2018,1,Due to surgery incompetence had to get emergency prescription from out of hours service. After 4 phonecalls and a lot of empty promises they still have not corrected my repeat prescription
Burlington,"Doctor listened to me, explained treatment",6/21/2019,5,I am diabetic and see the doctor regularly. The doctor listened to me and explained the treatment to me. Sometimes I use an interpreter on the phone and I did this time.
Burlington,Doing good.,7/16/2015,5,"Doing good. Booking difficult, awaiting appointment."
Burlington,Don't like to share info with reception,8/24/2019,3,I don't like to share my personal information with reception staff. I wish the people who book the appointment consider whether to send a patient upstairs.
Burlington,Drs need to read medical records,10/20/2016,3,"Actually seeing a doctor who had read my records and listened.
Dislike intensely having to tell a receptionist the reason I want a GP appointment.  It's personal and private"
Burlington,Excellent,8/24/2019,5,I find this surgery excellent. I can usually get an appointment on the day as I don't mind which GP I see. Staff are friendly and always ready to listen.
Burlington,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I've never had a problem getting an appointment and care is good.
Burlington,Excellent but booking appoitnemts is hard and reception staff are poor.,1/8/2017,5,Booking an appointment is very difficult. Nurse explains treatment better than GP's. Receptionists poor.
Burlington,Excellent once you can get into the system.,2/21/2017,4,"Rushmere Lunch Club.  Social care is excellent, once you can get in the system"
Burlington,Excellent service but very hard to get appointments,1/8/2017,5,Hard to make appointment.  Ring at 8 am and don't get through until 9.15/9.30 and then they say all appointments gone - ring back next day.  10-20 minutes delay in appointments
Burlington,Fair,7/3/2017,3,Can't get an appointment when I need one.  You have to call after 8 am and sometimes won't get through until 9.45 and all appointments are gone.  Unless it is an emergency they say call back tomorrow
Burlington,fair,6/21/2016,3,One GP excellent.  Partner turned away when in great pain.  Needed emergency surgery!  Reception staff not good
Burlington,Fair but long wait to get an appointment.,1/8/2017,3,I had to wait a long time to book an appointment
Burlington,fair Nightmare getting appointment,6/21/2016,3,Nightmare getting an appointment.  Ring up at 8 am & five minutes later all are gone
Burlington,Felt rushed,3/3/2022,1,I had my learning disability annual review but had to go back for a second visit just to have a blood test done. This was frustrating and it would've been better if it could've been done on the same day.  The review was a bit rushed and had very little conversation and I wasn't told what to do to get the blood test results. The appointment was booked for half an hour but it was over much quicker than that and there was no discussion about improving my lifestyle.
Burlington,Friendly staff,4/23/2019,5,Friendly and try to help as best they can and it's pretty good to get appointments. The system works well and I use online system for my medications which are ready when I need them. Medical staff are friendly and explain things well.
Burlington,Front line staff need training,7/16/2015,3,Front line staff need better training in how to treat the public.
Burlington,Frustrating it take so long to get through,12/19/2018,3,I visit the surgery regularly and it is frustrating that it takes so long to get through in the morning. There are times when you're asked to call back the next day as there are no appointments available. The GPs though are generally good.
Burlington,Generally happy with care,8/16/2018,4,Receptionist polite. Doctor treated me  as an individual and explained treatment well. Usually wait 10 to 20 minutes to get in to see GP for my appointment.
Burlington,Getting an appointment difficult,8/24/2019,4,"Getting an appointment in the morning is difficult. I'm not keen on reception staff asking so many questions when it's personal. A few weeks ago, I was asked to speak to the doctor about an issue as the nurse didn't seem to know how to handle the scenario."
Burlington,Getting through on phone difficult,3/28/2019,2,"Very busy and even getting through on the phone is extremely difficult. Throughout the day the phone isn't answered, this morning it took nearly 40 minutes to get through but I did get a doctor's appointment. To have to wait three days for an appointment when you're not well isn't great and I wasn't offered a GP+ appointment or call back from the doctor. Staff can be a little sharp or unfriendly, once you've been told there are no appointments available they just finish the call."
Burlington,Good,3/4/2019,5,Good
Burlington,good,7/3/2019,4,"Good experience - my diabetes is now under control.
I see the diabetic nurse every three months for a check up.  She has given me very good advice and helped me to lose weight.  My diabetes is now under control.
I like the surgery very much.  Whenever I phone early for an emergency appointment I get one.  I have moved to the other side of Ipswich  and prefer to Burlington rather than change to one nearer tome"
Burlington,good,7/3/2019,4,Usually can get appointment when I need it.  They know about your back pain.  I have painkillers.  Came from numerous falls
Burlington,Good experience all round,7/16/2015,5,Everyone quite pleasant. No problems. Receptionist fine.
Burlington,Good experiences,8/24/2019,4,"On every visit, I have had good experiences plus referrals to hospital which turned out to have positive results."
Burlington,Good lliaison between doctors,6/9/2016,5,you can ask to see a specific doctor which is really nice.  Very good lliaison between the doctors and the hospital.  They are very good at calling you back to discuss the problems
Burlington,"Good, kind, professional",6/21/2019,5,I had a phone consultation about my thyroid. The doctor told me i needed treatment. It was a same day consultation but often appointments are difficult to get. Sometimes I need to call 20 or 30 times to get through. You are told what number in the queue you are on the phone. Triage system is okay but I sometimes find it difficult to explain why I need an appointment as my English is not good enough. This consultation was good - kind polite and professional. I was asked lots of questions about how I felt and sent for a blood test. I got treatment and feel much better. I felt someone cares about me. The doctor really helped me to find the right words.
Burlington,Great house calls and doctors,7/4/2017,5,Since I've been unwell the doctors have been doing house calls and they have been great. Encouraging me to have house calls
Burlington,Happy,8/24/2019,3,I am overall happy with this surgery. I do have to wait a while before I can make an appointment. I wish there were a few more female GPs.
Burlington,Harder to get advanced appointments,12/19/2018,4,"Its quite easy to get an 'on the day' appointment but if you want to see someone specific it becomes more difficult, up to 6 weeks wait. Advanced appointments are harder to get and it would be better to have more pre-bookable appointments available for ongoing issues. You do spend time on the phone trying to get through and I have been cut off in the past as well.  I do find the question asked by reception staff about the reason for the appointment a little invasive at times. Reception staff are very good, you don't feel like just another patient when talking to them an they are helpful. I'm happy to see any of the doctors, you do get used to seeing one and they then move on. It would be good to have more flexibility around discussing just one issue otherwise you end up having an extra appointment."
Burlington,Harder to get an appointment with a doctor,8/24/2018,3,"Overall a good surgery but it's gone downhill in recent years as patients can no longer choose to see a doctor themselves as they have to explain symptoms etc to receptionists who are not health care professionals.  I know the receptionists are told to do this by the doctors but this still means that patient choice has been taken away and now doctors and administrators decide if you can see a doctor - this is wrong!  When you phone the surgery you now get a message saying ""We have listened to patients!""  Really, are you saying that the overwhelming majority of your patients want to tell receptionists what their health concerns are and are happy for their choice to see a particular doctor, or indeed any doctor, taken away from them?""  I very much doubt it and I, as a long time patient, are certainly not one of them!  Doctor doesn't always know best you know but sadly the surgery has gone back to the era when we were told 'be a patient patient!""  Wouldn't it be nice if patients did what they were told by the great man or woman like they used to...……."
Burlington,Helpful,12/19/2018,5,I don't have any issues getting to see a doctor and phoning the surgery is not an issue for me either. Communication with staff is good and they are helpful.
Burlington,Helpful,12/1/2017,4,"Quite helpful, tend to see the same doctor most of the time.  My doctor has a good attitude and will spend time with me"
Burlington,Helpful and polite,2/17/2022,5,"They have always responded when I have needed them - all through the last two years, under great pressure, I have only once felt that they could have been more reactive to a concern."
Burlington,"Helpful, kind and patient",1/18/2022,5,"I have always found them ready to go above and beyond when they know care is needed. This horrendously busy time is putting a terrible strain on them but they still respond as quickly as they can. From medical staff to receptionists, they are all great."
Burlington,I can never get an appointment,1/3/2018,3,I can never get an appointment. It isn't possible to book in advance and if I 'phone and all appointments are gone the 'phone cuts off.
Burlington,I will never recommend for my friends,8/14/2018,1,When i try get appointment on the phone never getting. I cannot work because can't get appointment to doctor.
Burlington,Lack of continuity,12/19/2018,4,The surgery get the translation service on the phone for me which works really well. I can get appointments when I need them and make things  easier. I do see different doctors all the time which makes it more difficult as I have to explain everything again. Appointments are flexible especially when using the language line. As a family we get good support from the surgery.
Burlington,Look after me,3/5/2023,4,"They do look after me well here. I do not see a GP, but those I see have the right knowledge to help me at the time."
Burlington,Making appointments is sometimes difficult,7/16/2015,5,To see the doctor you want is sometimes difficult. Can take half an hour to get through by 'phone to make an appointment.
Burlington,Mostly ok,11/17/2016,5,Mostly ok - but one near miss with a potential for injection/ vaccination clash
Burlington,No GP face to face appointments,3/5/2023,3,"In for my regular blood tests that they do to 'keep and eye ' on me, as it is linked to my medication. I wish you could make a face to face appointment with a GP like we are being told we can, instead of ringbacks all the time."
Burlington,No review - Only ratings provided,7/16/2015,4,No review - Only ratings provided
Burlington,Not enough appointments,8/9/2016,3,Doctors overall good.  Not enough appointments and difficult booking on the day and in advance.  considering changing practice.
Burlington,Not listened to,7/10/2015,1,I can't get any help from the surgery - I'm heard but not listened to about my mental health.
Burlington,Not rushed,4/23/2019,5,"Very happy with the surgery, staff interact with you very wel and you don't feel rushed, spending enough time going over the issues you have. Communication between the pharmacy and the surgery hasn't been great although they've sorted it now. I do still get medication prescribed that I don't need even though I've told them before. This may of course be an issue with the hospital I'm not sure. The flu clinic is very busy and having multiple sessions would help ease that. Having to call first thing does make it difficult to get appointments but we've always been able to get them. A well man clinic would be good to have or if there is one it could be advertised better."
Burlington,On line service not fit for purpose,10/30/2018,2,"Repeat prescription item stated it could not be reordered as it needed to be reviewed by a clinician.  When I did eventually get through on the appointments line (thinking I had to at least have a tel appointment) I was told by the call handler to request the medication on line as a custom request. When I suggested the system was not fit for purpose as the online message did not suggest this was the process, the call handler agreed and said their IT department had been made aware of this some time ago but nothing had been done.  Think about all the telephone calls that could be saved if this were resolved!"
Burlington,Outstanding and supportive,8/30/2018,5,Have an outstanding and supportive service from the practice. They do try to make sure that my son sees the same GP all the time.
Burlington,Permanently engaged,3/5/2023,3,"Rang yesterday 152 times and over 120 times today, but it is permanently engaged. The phone system is difficult and this was on behalf of my very hard of hearing mother in law who is extremely unwell. This phone system is ridiculous as our attempts to call were just to even get onto the 'waiting in the queue'. When in the past I have got to that stage and got to number one, you can still be waiting in the queue for another 15 minutes."
Burlington,Really good nurse practitioner,12/19/2018,2,Getting through on the phone is very difficult. They say that the surgery opens at 8 am but the phone never seems to open later. Online appointment aren't very good as you can't get next day appointments and they're limited.  I'd like better monitoring of an ongoing condition as I feel no one is taking any interest. The nurse practitioner takes time with you and is really good.
Burlington,Really good to help my children,3/5/2023,4,"They have been very good in getting someone across that is more specialised in seeing one of the children. They are a paediatrician and meant I did not need to go to A and E. Very pleased with this today, as made a massive effort to help."
Burlington,Reception are helpful,4/23/2019,3,"It's difficult to get seen, I've called a couple of times to get an appointment and been told none are available. When I managed to talk to reception they were accommodating and helpful and arranged for me to have an appointment. Staff are fairly good and explain things quite well, generally you are only offered an appointment with one person but this hasn't impacted on the care I receive and even when I had an ongoing issuethe doctors all knew what was going on with me. The waiting areas can be quite cramped."
Burlington,Receptionist is extreamly rude!!!!!,2/10/2018,2,Receptionist assumes to know what you need books in with drs and wastes their time when I asked for a nurse specifically for contraception. Multiple times have had issues with receptionist refusing to book appointments ever or reading out my results incorrectly or stating my results are unavailable when they are available . No issues with the drs the drs are actually brilliant drs. The surgery is let down by extreamly rude receptionist
Burlington,Receptionist sometimes not friendly.,7/16/2015,4,Receptionist sometimes not friendly.
Burlington,Receptionists can be rude,9/21/2018,2,The receptionists can be very rude. On two occasions now I have taken my son in because he was poorly. Both times he was checked over and pronounced ok only to need to be taken by Ambulance to Ipswich Hospital shortly after.
Burlington,Receptionists give  impression of superiority,7/16/2015,5,My overall impression of the receptionists could have a little to be desired in as much as some give the impression of superiority.
Burlington,Rude doctor,4/10/2018,1,"Considering I work for the NHS I was very shocked at the very rude doctor who stated I was late , which in fact I wasn’t late there computer system you log in was not working , which mean't I had to queue and then the reception was slow and didn’t to be fair know what she was doing which resulted me in being booked in late ! In the words of the rude doctor - you are late and your lucky I saw you today!  Unprofessional especially when the surgery is always late and leaving patients waiting 40 plus minutes. The fact I wasn’t late too. Not just that the text your sent to star your service received never works! More training for receptionists and for staff to remember they are there to deliver a level of care and should act professional - there are many rude doctors and being a patient for 28 years  I am honestly going to look for another doctors surgery! Once was a 5 star doctor now is a 1 star !!!"
Burlington,Rude receptionist.,6/8/2016,1,"I telephoned for an appointment, they were rude to me. I have some sores on my legs. I saw a nurse the week before and she sent me to Riverside. I had a blood test and Riverside told me to see my GP. The reception team at Burlington Road would not help me get an appointment - no appointments, cannot book one. Finally I got one today after 20 calls and had to push for an appointment. Not helpful."
Burlington,Signage not great,3/5/2023,4,I don't use this often. You have to sit in area that is named a waiting area 1 or 2. I was told to be in '1' which I was unsure of where it was. I found it as sign is up but very small. I was then called through to a room which was not even in the same end of the building and difficult to see. There are no signs for the toilets for direction of them.
Burlington,Staff can be very abrupt,8/24/2019,3,"Staff can be very abrupt. I feel I am not getting a clear answer and I have been sent to the hospital but have come back as I'm still not getting a clear diagnosis. I wish I could have a longer appointment, I used to be listened to more."
Burlington,Staff very good,4/23/2019,5,"Always been good to me, I don't normally have any problems getting appointments and I haven't  noticed much difference when calling lately. Staff are very good they ask why  you need the appointment and then you do get one. I was given a choice of different doctors to see today so it does work well and usually theyre pretty good."
Burlington,Staff very supportive,8/9/2016,3,The staff is very supportive when it comes to me going to the GP.  However there are times when I'm not able to get an appointment
Burlington,Takes time to get through,12/19/2018,2,"It takes a long time to get through in the morning, initially you can't get through but when you do you're in a queue for sometime. I feel that the diabetic appointments are not frequent enough so I end up visiting more regularly."
Burlington,Tend to be seen on the day,12/19/2018,4,"They have always got time for you and getting appointments isn't too bad, a little queue on the phone in the morning and you tend to get seen on the day you need an appointment. I don't come often but it generally works for me when I do. Medications are available from the pharmacy and are accurate and delivered which helps. Reception staff are friendly and helpful and I tend to see the same doctor when I visit, which I like."
Burlington,The system makes things difficult,3/5/2023,2,"I do not blame any of the people who are trying to work their hardest. The system makes things difficult for them. You barely ever see a GP here, it is all 'ringbacks' with them. In today to see a Nurse though."
Burlington,They have supported me so much big thank you,1/15/2016,5,I was victim of harassment from my ex partner and they support in a difficult time in my life and helped me to deal with my stress and back problem and what a wonderful doctors a big thank I am back to work in month
Burlington,Told to call back the next day,4/23/2019,3,"Getting an appointment is difficult, you call and are told to call back the next day as all the appointments are gone. You're not offered call backs or GP+ as an alternative either. Its also similar when trying to get a nurse appointment. Explanations from staff are ok but they do vary in the depth they go in to. Staff are generally friendly and helpful and do try to sort things out."
Burlington,Treatment I have received has been brilliant.,9/1/2020,5,Doctor listens and gives you time to express your feelings then give accurate treatment. Can’t speak highly enough of this practice.
Burlington,Tricky to get an appointment,12/1/2017,5,Sometimes a little tricky to get an appointment but staff are always good.
Burlington,Usually can get appointment,10/5/2016,4,"l usually can get an appointment when I need one. I have had many falls and have bad back pain, they have put me on painkillers that are helping. (Lady in sheltered housing). They have not looked into why I fall a lot but my vision is not great."
Burlington,Very frustrated,8/24/2019,3,"I am very frustrated that my son has been called in for an asthma check today, but he gets checked at the hospital regularly. getting an appointment is difficult, I don't like the reception staff asking so many questions as it's personal."
Burlington,Very Good Service,4/28/2015,5,"You can get an appointment at the surgery, you may not get to see your doctor but you will be able to see a doctor. Ive never been let down by them."
Burlington,Very impressed by receptionists,5/21/2015,5,"Phoned for apt for husband, receptionist asked what was wrong, called doctor who told me to phone for ambulance at once. The symptoms really weren't anything severe but it transpired he was in severe heart failure. I know many people don't like being asked by receptionist but we have much to be thankful for the fact that they were so on the ball."
Burlington,Very rude receptionist,9/11/2018,1,Receptionists are very rude.. they think their doctors when they ain't.. never able to get appointment even though I  am on the phone from 8 O'clock in the morning. Never send any of my friends or family to that doctors
Burlington,Waited for appointment. Doctor listened.,6/21/2019,4,Had to wait a month for my appointment. Then had to wait 50 minutes to see the doctor. The doctor listened to me and explained what was wrong and about my treatment.
Burlington,when i see a doctor then great,5/22/2016,1,You can't seem to get past the reception I phoned up 20 times at 8.00 am only to be told all appointments are taken the staff are very rude and always want to know what my symptoms are I even got asked whats wrong with me the reception are not medic trained. if I need to see a doctor I should be offered an appointment or an alternative not get told try again tomorrow.
Burlington,Where are the GP's?,3/5/2023,2,"With many issues, I would have hoped to have seen a GP, but this NEVER happens. The GP's are nowhere to be seen, as they just do ringbacks. I ask others who are patients here and they have same experience.
With multiple health conditions I do feel I am a patient that warrants seeing a GP, but it is just not happening."
Cardinal,100% improvement,12/17/2021,5,"Seen by a GP within 3hrs, Dr was very thorough, went through my problems and took the necessary actions he considered necessary. So nice to have a face to face consultation. The young lady who took bloods and did the ECG was lovely. 100% improvement over a few months ago"
Cardinal,45min wait on phone!,12/14/2021,1,"Poor communications and service, should never have been allowed to merge or take on new patients until all staff and systems in place, my 89 yr old friend has gone down hill badly due to the inability to see face to face a GP she has waited in for phone calls which do not happen and suggesting she goes on line etc etc does not cut the ice."
Cardinal,54 mins unable to get sick child appointment,9/21/2022,1,"I Spent 52 minutes on hold waiting for the phone to be answered.  To be told that I couldn't make an appointment for my sick child - a ""care navigator""  would call me back!

Completely unacceptable!"
Cardinal,6 canceled appointments,3/30/2022,1,Waiting over 6 mths and 6 canceled appointments for a review they asked 4
Cardinal,A very long wait for appointment,5/10/2021,2,It took me three weeks to speak to a doctor and wasnt allowed to see the one requested instead was contacted by a Clinical practitioner and given a face to face 20min appointment 2 weeks later. I was told I could only speak about two things during that appointment and had to have another one two weeks later to deal with the other. Thats 7 weeks and no further forward. I feel the practice is pushing everyone towards 111 or A & E Is not right.
Cardinal,A&E as could not get seen,10/5/2022,1,My arm was infected after a tattoo issue. Could not get to see anyone and had to go to A&E which resulted in being given drugs to sort. It is ridiculous. Has taken 3 months to get a blood test. They were prescribing me without seeing me.
Cardinal,About advanced practice nurse,7/22/2022,5,Have had a ongoing knee infection prob for months which has now been sorted thanks to the care and understanding I received. The practice nurse listened and did a fantastic job for me. Thanks again.
Cardinal,Access issues with AskMyGP,6/2/2023,1,"Is anyone concerned that, nearly every day for the past few weeks, AskMyGP appears to be open at 8am (or sometimes later than this) and then Cardinal Medical Practice deliberately shutdown access - sometimes as early as 10am, with the words: ""AskMyGP is currently unavailable due to the unprecedented demand for our services... all of our appointment slots are fully booked ... our phone lines will remain operational as we are still dealing with urgent requests"". 

Whilst occasional high demand is not unreasonable, demand cannot be unprecedented every day for weeks on end! What sort of service is this for residents of North-West Ipswich? I've no doubt that all GP practices are stretched at the moment, but I don't see other GP practices across Suffolk using this technique.

What action is Suffolk Healthwatch taking over this?

Does Cardinal Medical Practice not have any sort of contractual obligation to the SNEE ICB to provide access to GP services (including non-urgent appointments!) between 8:30 and 6:30 every working day?

If all non-urgent appointment slots are booked in the first couple of hours every day, that can only mean that Cardinal Medical Practice is simply not employing enough clinical staff (locums if necessary!) to deal with patient demand.

I seem to remember that Dan Poulter reported Cardinal Medical Practice to CQC back in 9 2021 for failure of the practice to provide sufficient numbers of care navigators to answer their telephone lines. Supposedly after meetings with the local CCG he was, according to the EADT, assured that the situation was improving, that new staff had been recruited and that a new internet-based solution for accessing GP services was being deployed (that would solve all these problems!) - although it has to be said that a significant proportion of patients may struggle with internet-based access to services. Now that this online solution for accessing clinical help has been rolled-out, it would appear that Cardinal Medical Practice is doing it again - it is again deliberately making it difficult for the public to gain access to GP services. This action by the GP partners at Cardinal (remember they have already been caught-out and reported to CQC and are currently marked ""requires improvement"") is utterly shocking. Is their action bringing the profession into disrepute? Having already been shown the ""yellow"" card by CQC, is it time for the ""red"" card to come out? What is the MP doing about it now? And, with hindsight, was the MP fobbed off by the local CCG last time round?"
Cardinal,After 1 hour free I get charged,5/18/2022,1,"My landline is that I get the first hour free then get charged. I ring into the surgery, wait and wait then you get down to 10 in the queue, but my hour of waiting is now up, what do I do? Hang up a restart or pay? Last time I stayed on it cost me £9. I cannot afford to do that every time I need medical assistance. I do not use the computer so telephone is my only option"
Cardinal,All done online with Ask My GP,6/17/2022,1,"They prefer to do most of their work on the phone and waiting to get through has been very costly for me, the last time I tried to get through to them it cost me nearly £10 on my phone. I've been in pain for 5 months and have had 4 phone appointments and then I insisted on a face to face appointment. Amazingly I was then sent off for scans and to the heart centre, if I'd been seen earlier I would've had this earlier.  I also can't understand how for asthma reviews these can be done over the phone.  The phone calls have just delayed me being properly diagnosed and being referred to hospital"
Cardinal,always hard to get an appointment,3/11/2021,1,its so hard to get an appointment and new facilities people are rude. my doctors surgery was in my area but when i do get an appointment im sent all around ipswich its ridiculous.
Cardinal,App is good for me,5/17/2022,4,"Being 30th in the telephone queue, I decided to try the App. I have always had a response the same or next day, so for me it has been brilliant. One was an email as I only needed some information and the other 2 were phone calls that did not need a face to face appointment."
Cardinal,Appalling,11/17/2021,1,The phone queue is ridiculous. I had a blood test at the beginning of October and have heard nothing about the results.. this was never the case before the merger. I can’t even call up for the results because of the 1hr waiting time. It’s an absolute joke. I can’t go online or use a computer during the day as I work on construction sites. How would you suggest I receive my results?
Cardinal,Appalling,11/15/2021,1,The phone queue is ridiculous. I had a blood test at the beginning of October and have heard nothing about the results.. this was never the case before the merger. I can’t even call up for the results because of the 1hr waiting time. It’s an absolute joke. I can’t go online or use a computer during the day as I work on construction sites. How would you suggest I receive my results?
Cardinal,Ask my gp,1/2/2022,5,"Really impressed- within a few hours I had a phone call from one of the GP’s who asked me to come down to see her straight away. A very kind, knowledgeable and efficient lady who examined me and then completed a referral to the hospital."
Cardinal,Ask my GP is not responding,10/5/2022,1,"I receive a text to contact the gp in respect to a letter they have received….. nearly 48 hours later from contacting the gp online, I have no response 
Tried calling ….. no.16 in the queue 
And I’m the one being told to contact them"
Cardinal,Ask my gp takes two weeks for a return call,9/17/2022,1,"As a diabetic, I feel I’m not getting the service that I should be getting and as a working woman too never able to sort anything out. It takes around two weeks for a return response."
Cardinal,Askmygp doesn’t get a response,4/28/2022,1,I was contacted by text and asked to make contact through askmygp about an urgent issue. Three days later I’m still waiting for a response.
Cardinal,AskMyGP is GREAT,1/2/2022,5,"It was impossible to get seen or have any appointment before they were available at AskMyGP, but now it flows so fast and easy, send in a question and have a reply back in a few hours. This is such a massive step up from being so far back in phone queue that you just got cut off. Very very happy with this new service, and also with how fast the prescriptions are sent out when ordered through NHS app."
Cardinal,askMyGP is not intuitive for booking an appt.,11/3/2022,3,"The Chesterfield Drive surgery has always been great, this feedback only relates to the askMyGP service. I was sent a letter asking me to use the askMyGP service to book my annual asthma review - my request was treated as though I was raising a new medical complaint and I was asked irrelevant questions. The service should have an option to key in a reference value (which should be provided on the letter) and it would then understand that the request is to book an appointment as requested."
Cardinal,Avoid,12/14/2021,1,Takes almost up too 1 hour to answer then fobs you off and tells you to go on the ask my GP website instead. Receptionists are rude and don’t even know what planet they are on half the time. Nurses are even worse
Cardinal,Awful,5/22/2023,2,"Whilst there are some lovely staff there, since the surgery became Cardinal Medical Practice,  it's terrible.  I know they'll trying their best, when nurses give out the wrong info,  patients given medication that they shouldn't,  blood tests go missing and have to be retaken. Too many people and not enough suitable staff."
Cardinal,Awful,11/12/2021,1,"Up to a two hour wait to speak to rude receptionists, who then ask you to use the Askmygp service. We don’t all have time to jump through hoops & wait days on end. I suffer with mental health & will not use these services again, was made to feel a nuisance for wanting to see my own gp not a locum."
Cardinal,Awful - takes ages to get through on phone,1/12/2021,1,"Since there merged can never get though!!! Number 20 in the queue thought not bad, I was in the 30's last time I'll wait, it took from 3pm till 4-50pm to get though , ridiculous !!!!"
Cardinal,Awful now,10/27/2021,1,"Before the merge, Chesterfield drive were fantastic. Now you can't get through on the phone, you can't get answers to complaints via email or letter from *name removed* at the practice. Don't join if you want to be looked after."
Cardinal,Awful service here,3/31/2022,1,"I had a text message to book an appointment with a Dr to discuss my latest test results in last week February I tried to book next day on ask my GP they weren’t taking bookings. Rang waited 35 mins until finally answered by someone having a conversation with a colleague they then hung up on me. Back in  telephone queue 25mins later managed to speak to some. I explained about the text request and also asked if I could speak to a Dr about palpitations and high blood pressure at night. Receptionist said she’d book a double appointment with a Dr. 
Had phone call next day from Dr and they asked me to come to surgery. I attended discussed blood pressure problems and heart rhyth, they asked me to book blood test and 24hr heart monitor. I asked about discussing my scan results they said the heart problem was too complicated they can’t discuss it now I will have to make another appointment. I went home and tried to book the blood test and heart monitor.Earliest blood test 3 weeks away (booked), 24hr monitor earliest appointment 16th6!booked
2 weeks ago I had a text from another Dr who Ive never seen saying they’d issued a prescription for the condition I was supposed to see a dr about to discuss.  On Tuesday 29th March I had a text from Cardinal medical Practice stating that ‘due to unforeseen circumstances we have had to cancel your appointment for heart monitor on 16th 6. No apology no other booking offered. I have been taking my blood pressure at home for the last five weeks and went on Ask my GP on Tuesday29th March booking a call from Dr to discuss this. No acknowledgement and no call to date 31st March 6pm. The place is a mess. This is disgraceful and stressful. I feel that Suffolk Primary Care are forgetting about caring for their patients completely."
Cardinal,"Awful, unable to get appointments",11/15/2021,1,Disgusted. Try to get through and get cut off. People who actually work cant speak to anyone or get an appointment.
Cardinal,Baby Immunizations,2/12/2021,1,"My baby was refused immunization because I was 18 minute late.
And I think this is not fair enough considering the fact that anything can happen unexpectedly with a baby."
Cardinal,Been ringing for days for an appointment,10/13/2021,1,"On being put on hold for a ""care navigator"", receptionist I assume, the lowest I have been on the waiting phone line is 31, I don't have the time to sit on hold for goodness knows how long."
Cardinal,Been waiting since Wednesday for a call back,5/21/2022,1,"Not had even a phone call. I am in agony with my back and can hardly walk, also tried ask my gp no reply either, so had to stay in bed all day Monday."
Cardinal,Blood test delays,6/16/2023,2,"The hospital ordered bloods for me on discharge to have at the surgery. Was expecting to be contacted by them. 6 weeks later I have still heard nothing, so I rang in, only to be told to go online and book at Landseer road. They had nothing for 3 weeks so rang surgery back, only to be offered something on the Monday. Surely they could have done that in the first place without me being given the runaround!"
Cardinal,Brilliant system,11/18/2021,5,"Much easier to use AskMyGP system. I used to have to wait in the queue on the telephone and it was frustrating. Now, within an hour everything was sorted and I came into Chesterfield drive surgery for an appointment."
Cardinal,Called back within 2hrs - exceptional service,2/2/2022,5,"Spoke to nurse and seen within another hr ,exceptional service"
Cardinal,Can not get through on the phone,12/12/2021,1,Have to wait an hour to get through  and when you do they are not helpful and just try to push you through to an online portal. Hopeless for a 90 year old lady
Cardinal,Can’t be bothered,4/17/2022,1,"My wife leaves requests and no one comes back.  Very poor GP Practice.  If it were a commercial business, it would be bankrupt :("
Cardinal,Can’t book appt on phone only via AskMyGP,4/14/2022,1,"Terrible. Why can’t you book a Drs appt online or on the phone. Have to register with AskMyGP then fill out form. This is bad enough but you can only do this during opening hours. Why?

How are old people meant to understand how to do this?

People do not understand. It is no wonder A&E is so busy people would rather go direct there than have to fill out forms and wait for someone to call you back. 

This needs to be sorted urgently. It does not work."
Cardinal,Can’t get hold of anyone,9/20/2022,1,Told to register for ask my GP - but there is no registration link only Log In! And there is no ask my GP app either.
Cardinal,Can’t get my Future appointments,4/4/2022,1,Make it a bit easier for us old ones
Cardinal,Can’t see a doctor or get through by phone,11/17/2021,1,Been trying to see a doctor for months. Been on new system not heard back at all. Tells me I need to see doctor queue so long on phone. When do get through they say no appointments phone back next week. A joke.
Cardinal,Can’t work out how to book an appointment,12/15/2021,1,I have to ring the practice. How complicated can you make it to book an appointment?. It’s ridiculous
Cardinal,Cannot book routine appointment,10/5/2023,1,I received a text message telling me to book my annual hypertension review via AskMyGp. I went online to be told the site was closed!? How can a website be closed!? It said they would contact me via text or phone call! What is the point of having a website if you have to wait for a phone call - which will probably be made while I am working and can’t answer. I thought the whole idea was to avoid having to use the phone altogether. Not impressed.
Cardinal,Cannot contact & book appointment,10/11/2021,1,"I work office hours Monday to Friday and with the time I need to commute to work I cannot contact my GP within the restricted opening hours. The waiting time over the phone is over an hour, and online consultation can’t provide me with any help.
I’m unwell and left stuck with no options to be looked after."
Cardinal,Cannot fault,9/27/2022,5,"Informed me I needed an appointment, they rang at 9 for 10.15 at chesterfield drive. Doctor was brilliant. Very informative explained a lot of things"
Cardinal,Cannot phone to get app,9/11/2021,1,My 73 year old father is having breathing difficulties Spent over an hour in a queue on the phone (24th in queue ) only to be told cannot have a appointment to see a doctor and must either see pharmacist 1st or ring 111 after 18.30 . Why have a doctors surgery that seems to refuse to see patient and try’s to palm them off to someone else
Cardinal,Can't get through,2/10/2021,1,"Many times I have been on hold for more than 30 minutes  waiting to get through to reception,  only to be told my daughter has to wait 4 weeks for a telephone  appointment!! People who actually  work are not able to wait over half an hour to make an appointment."
Cardinal,Changing doctors as we speak.,9/20/2022,1,"I've used the ask my gp app at 1.20pm this afternoon with no reply, i believe this to be an important matter, I've also come to find out the app services are now closed."
Cardinal,Cost me £13,5/18/2022,1,"I had my phone bill and the call to this place, that I received nothing from as I got cut off, was £13! Not everyone has free calls during the day as they cannot afford it, but now I cannot afford to access a service that I am supposed to have for free. It is worrying when my health is not great now."
Cardinal,Couldn’t find my veins for blood test,7/8/2022,1,"Went to Norwich road for blood test after a distressing build up to it. They attempted to get blood but couldn’t find my veins, now have to wait 2weeks for another one at Landseer Road."
Cardinal,Delays in getting checks,6/16/2023,3,"Had major delays in getting checks for diabetes as no ongoing appointments are made and can't get through on the phone when AskMyGP is shutdown.
Nurses say they can't make your next appointment for the check and you have to phone on the day. But you can't always get through and things just slide. I am not 2 months on from when I should have been checked."
Cardinal,Diabolical!,11/15/2021,1,"Called and was number 47 in queue, got cut off after waiting half an hour at number 27. Called again, number 48, got cut off again at number 21. 
Tried E Consult, said I'd get a call back by 6:30pm the NEXT day.
I have asthma which needs treatment because I'm unwell and can't get medical help from my GP.
I have no option now but to ring 111 who will automatically send me to the hospital because it's asthma, when it could easily be treated by a GP!"
Cardinal,Didn’t receive call,4/4/2022,1,I suffer with anxiety and I’m waiting to speak about some results. I should have got a call today 4.03.2022. But nothing I also tried calling the doctors and kept getting cut off
Cardinal,Disappointed,6/30/2022,1,Was assured by 2 doctors i could collect a sick note today. Rung to see if ready was greeted by not very helpful & rude person who said it wasnt done. Was put onto list. I needed to have this to my boss today as i did stress.
Cardinal,Dreadful,8/4/2022,1,"Waited all day for call back surgery phoned me 2 days ago with blood test result for my 86year old mum said she had to be seen friday but couldnt book me an apt. Couldnt get one on ask my gp so phoned at 8 15 friday morning i have taken a day off work was told doc who said mum had to be seen was off sick they couldnt book mum in gad to wait for a doc call back 9 hours later still no call back i am now 14th in call queue mum wont be seen today.  Weekend tomirow im not off now till next Friday which is good Friday!!! Mum cant get there herself and gp insisted it needs a face to face apt!!!????#$#$%#$^ mum has tested as b12 deficient which is causing her a number of issues, so when is she likely to get the help she needs??? Plus ive lost a days work and she wasnt even seen let alone received a call back!!!"
Cardinal,Easy to use,4/2/2022,4,Easy to use and problems sorted within the same day and most of the time you get the person you request. The only issue is sometimes they close down the query without allowing you chance to message back.
Cardinal,Either in a queue or,10/25/2021,1,"Every time I call, I am approx number 28 in the queue and have to hold on for between 40 mins to an hour. However, today I have been trying to get through since 2.30pm and it is now 5.30pm.  Each time I have to listen to a long pre recorded message to then be told ""no lines available"" this is for 3 hours!!!  I cannot see that this is acceptable.  I understand that there is staff shortages but something needs to be rectified here.  I never had a problem getting through to my surgery before the merger."
Cardinal,Excellent experience using 'Askmygp' today,4/1/2022,5,Fast response to my message and good advice given. Great system for patients like me who have a hearing loss.
Cardinal,Extremely long wait times for everything!,11/15/2021,1,"Every time you call you are in a long queue of over 40! When you do eventually get through you don’t get to see a doctor.
Needed a medical questionnaire completed and had to wait a 3 weeks just for a signature and they charge approximately £40 for the pleasure. Even when I visited the surgery to see if it had been completed it was upgraded to urgent and still wasn’t done urgently so had to chase even further. When it was eventually completed I had to go to a totally different surgery to the one I have been registered with which is local to where I live which is why I’m registered there. The only positive I can say about this surgery is that when you do eventually speak to a member of staff they are helpful and try there best to help you, unfortunately this doesn’t out weight the many negatives."
Cardinal,Failed myself and son in the space of a week,7/1/2022,1,Refused to see my three week baby so ended up phoning 111 and spending the night in hospital. Not informed by anyone about having an infection 10 days post section! Left it for another week as was in agony to be told I should had been informed a week previous ! Lack of patient care!
Cardinal,Fantastic service,3/25/2022,5,"Fantastic service, app easy to use, fast, response very helpful."
Cardinal,Filter calls better,9/28/2022,3,"It is very frustrating that whatever your need is, you have to wait for ages on the telephone. If you cannot make an appointment for midwife, for example I feel a system needs to be in place that filters you off for a quick call. Another example is to call for blood test results. Even when you call later on, for results, the wait is just ridiculously long."
Cardinal,First class service,3/10/2021,5,I would like to thank all the staff for a excellent service through out the last eighteen months. I have always received fantastic help with any problem during the 12 years i have been at this practise. Please keep up the excellent service. The excellent service as carried on during the change over and i can say i have not had any problems
Cardinal,From excellent to appalling,11/15/2021,2,"As a long term patient at the practice, there was a time when I couldn’t fault them, my GP was an incredible person who’s compassion and understanding exceeded anything. They arranged my diagnosis for autism and I felt validated. Last year, and up until now, my mental health has deteriorated, my physical health is now getting worse. I understand in the current climate the restrictions regarding covid, but the shuttered door at the front has led me to feel that I can’t contact the surgery."
Cardinal,Gone downhill fast over last year,12/18/2021,1,"Cannot get in contact with anyone unless you wait over 3 hours on hold, went for blood tests, they called several times to say I have a message at reception but I could not answer phone at the time, tried calling back and was 64th in que, went into reception and was told they had sent letter but wouldn't say what results were, still waiting for letter over a week later."
Cardinal,Good but a few small issues,11/10/2021,4,"Very good once you get through on the phone, which can take some time and you can be well down the list when you join the queue. There does appear to be some confusion between the practice and the chemist as we regularly experience issues. We've been told something isn't available only for large amounts to suddenly be given to us. We've also been sent a number of video appointment letters but the letters don't actually say what the appointments are for, so we'll just have to turn up and see what it's all about."
Cardinal,Great improvement over last few months,1/31/2022,5,"Since AskMyGP has been implemented, the service has improved exeptionally. Fast, efficient, caring staff. Great service."
Cardinal,Great online system,11/18/2021,5,We used AskMyGP on Tuesday but as it was a bit late we got a call the next working day. Today we used it and got a call in 30 minutes. This is such a good system and much better than it used to be before we used it.
Cardinal,Have contacted Ask my g.p a few times,1/31/2022,5,"I've made 3 ask my g.p requests since Thursday, each time I've been responded to by a telephone conversation.  I like this system better than before."
Cardinal,Have only seen locums for last few years.,10/18/2021,1,"I have a long term condition but haven’t seen a GP since last March 2020, who was a locum. Telephoned surgery last week and was 45th in queue. I emailed in the end. Am waiting for an appointment to see a GP who is likely to be at surgery for a number of years. I’ve been told it will be sometime in November. Most people are helpful but unable to do anything. Not useful when you have a progressive illness and feel cut adrift."
Cardinal,Having received a letter from Cardinal Medical practice,3/12/2021,1,"The letter asked me to make an appointment for a long overdue checkup I rung through given number was 55mins in a queue only to get to be first and the young lady said she couldn't hear me she would call me back.......I'm still waiting. 
I went to Deben Rd surgery to be told we don't make appointments here it's done on line,!!!!!!!!! Or phone up!!!!!."
Cardinal,Home visit,5/21/2022,5,"After spinal surgery I was discharged home from hospital on 25th April. Reading my discharge papers raised a lot of unanswered questions. As I was housebound my family and I decided I needed a home visit by a GP. 
My step daughter phoned the surgery about 9 am on 3rd May. It was a long time before her call was answered by a very helpful care navigator. She asked for a doctor to visit me at home. Later that morning Dr phoned me and she visited me about 1pm. 
Dr addressed all my concerns, referring me for a blood test, referring me privately to my consultant, sorting out my medication etc.  
This time I couldn’t have asked for more.  A timely home visit from a very pleasant really helpful GP."
Cardinal,"I am 72 and expected to be computer savvy,",9/12/2021,1,"I have cateracts that affect my sight I phoned and spoke to someone and she told me to go onto website, it wont let me log in, all I want to do is order my repeat prescription"
Cardinal,I cannot contact mt GP,5/5/2022,2,"Their website 'Ask my GP' is down and everytime I try to call, I'm on hold for up to an hour only for the call to end before getting through. It's currently impossible to contact them! I have now had to make an appointment via 111 and put more pressure on the already stretched 111 service."
Cardinal,I have high blood pressure,7/12/2021,1,Getting hold of a doctor or someone to speak to here is nearly impossible ..No. 35 in queue for 20 minutes its an absolute disgrace
Cardinal,I was over 30 in the call list,11/18/2021,1,"It took me an hour and a half and £12 on my phone bill!!!!
I hope the elderly are keeping a close eye on their phone bills"
Cardinal,"If ill later in day, difficult",6/16/2023,3,"When using AskMyGP, if you use it in the morning, usually all is ok. If you feel ill later in the day, forget it! It was off from 9:30am recently, saying the system is at capacity. Clearly issues."
Cardinal,Ignored,11/29/2021,1,Totally ignored request to speak to a doctor
Cardinal,Ignoring high blood pressure,8/10/2022,1,I submitted my blood pressure readings over 7days following an annual review where my bp was too high. It took almost 2 months for me to get a response saying my bp meds to be adjusted when it should have been done straight away. Why so long leaving me with dangerously high blood pressure
Cardinal,"im not computer literate, its stressful",4/13/2022,3,this seems to be the only way to contact any one. i have had some success in getting an appointment but only after going on here on 3 days when I'm not working only to be called back the following day when i am working and there is no signal. i move around the site all day so calling on a land line is also impractical. I'm on here again today to try to speak to someone about a new prescription update. i done this friday and they called me saturday.
Cardinal,Impossible phone experience,10/27/2021,1,I have been trying to manage healthcare for my elderly relative - always at least 40 minutes on the phone waiting to get through if I can get through at all. Locums appear not to read medical notes before consulting about a patient. Very poor care
Cardinal,In phone queue 1 hour,11/29/2021,1,"Its rubbish what's going on, I'm not happy with this, I rang up  just after 8.30am I was number 50 in the queue so far I have been waiting 1 hour to talk to reception stop blaming covid it's disappointing."
Cardinal,Incorrect prescription issue,5/12/2021,1,It took 4 days to sort out the incorrect issue of a prescription for antibiotics meanwhile the patient was not getting any better.
Cardinal,It’s ridiculous the phone wait times,11/15/2021,1,I work on a construction site. I can’t use your ‘ask my gp’ or your ‘e-whatever’ as I have no computer or Wi-Fi access during the day. I have no doubt you will completely ignore this feedback & push on with this ridiculous system. I’m sure many old folk have no idea how to use/access this system. I will be looking for a new practice for myself and my family.
Cardinal,It's always closed by time I need to use it.,5/25/2023,1,"The ask my gp system is closed early, if you need to then phone it takes hours to get through, then some of the care navigators have a real attitude and don't accurately pass over the concerns."
Cardinal,Just awful. Number 40 in a telephone que!,8/11/2021,1,It's extremely difficult to get an appointment here. When you call and you're number 40 in the line be prepared to wait up to 2 hours before someone answers you.  I've also waited up to an hour only to be cut off when someone finally picked the call up
Cardinal,Just not getting answers,5/19/2023,1,"Ongoing cancer treatment and had a paramedic come out to look at my concerns but they then had to ring a GP. I didn't say I needed a home visit and would have been happy to come in and see a GP. Was told to go online and book blood tests, but the wait was very long so surgery did book them internally. A month later, heard nothing! In today for my partners blood test so I asked at reception about my own results. It was said that one states 'abnormal' yet I have heard nothing! I have asked for an appointment about this and was told I have to go on AskMyGP, it is so frustrating!"
Cardinal,Just wanted to speak to a real person,12/17/2021,1,"Poor listening to irrelevant words then cut off, Just wanted to speak to a real person after hospital operation re new medication."
Cardinal,Keep getting repeat meds,5/18/2022,1,"No one has seen my husband, they just keep issuing the same cream which I know long term can damage your skin (steroid cream). He needs to be seen face to face or just referred to skin specialist. It is getting ridiculous as it is getting worse not better."
Cardinal,Lack of service,12/10/2021,1,Not happy with the service or the lack of service. I’ve tried four times today just to find out about my blood results anc X-ray results. I be put in a queue of over 40 people . This is unexpectedly to say the least . There should be another extension for results. Also I am running out of naproxen and requested from pharmacy to 2 . With my normal tablets foo ok r it to be taken off by the . GP it need sorting before it’s to late
Cardinal,Level of service provided,2/17/2022,5,"I have never had a cause to question the level of service I have received since this practise was put together. Yes there was a few teething problems at first but once these were sorted out everything is fine. I have had no issues with the help I have received from doctors,nurses and  all the other staff. The main problem I think is people do not like change and are not prepared to wait for the changes to take place. The fact that these changes came at the same time as the pandemic probably did not help. All I can say based on my dealings is keep up the good work."
Cardinal,"Long wait, very rude GP",9/12/2021,1,"I called on behalf of a Customer and had to wait over an hour to speak to someone. When I finally got a call back the Doctor was incredibly rude, impatient and I will be logging a formal complaint. If that's how they speak to others working in the healthcare professionals, I dread to think how the customers get spoken to. If I was an elderly person I wouldn't bother trying to book an appointment as I'd be put off by the wait times and attitude of the ""professionals"". The lady I spoke to on reception was lovely, a shame the Doctor has let them down."
Cardinal,Lost my test results - very poor,1/12/2021,1,"I tried multiple times to get support from the surgery and I was told it didn't require a face to face appointment and no alternative support was offered. I then ended up admitted to hospital for 2 weeks. Following  discharge no contact at all.

More recently I reported problems with my cervix. I was asked to have swabs and told a date when they should be back. Heard nothing and after a week I used myGP to get an update (in hope of avoiding the long call waits) - the response was they can't find them. I then get a text asking me to call defeating the point of the app entirely. 2 days later they call to confirm its been lost and we need to do it all again...."
Cardinal,Merger was a bad idea,11/25/2021,1,"Since the merger of the surgery's the service has gone down hill. I cannot get an appoinment, have to wait long periods on the phone to talk to someone. Unable to book any doctors appointment online, needed to see doctor for past 3 months but unable to wait holding on the phone. NHS service has degraded due to this merger. The Norwich Road surgey had very good service until its merger, please, please, please revert back to the way it was. Trying to see  the same doctor for continued treatment is a nightmare now. This new system does not work, very poor service as a result of it.
Thanks"
Cardinal,Much better,11/18/2021,5,It used to be days and days before you would get to even get to speak to the receptionist and then weeks for an appointment. The new AskMyGP has meant I used it about 6pm last night and they called me this morning and got me in within an hour of the call. really good. (Chesterfield drive branch)
Cardinal,Never any issues,6/16/2023,4,I use AskMyGP all the time and never had problems. I have managed to get on to it the night before to submit something that then gets dealt with first thing the next day.
Cardinal,Nightmare,8/18/2022,1,After having sore hands for 3 weeks rang for appointment advised Pharmacist.  Pharmacist gave moisturiser but said ring 111 as a precaution.  Several 111  calls later told to take antihistamines for symptoms but see GP after weekend.   Lots more calls to GP and given stronger antihistamine (it was'nt).  How hard would it be for a simple blood test?   Thinking of going to A&E.
Cardinal,Nightmare,8/18/2022,1,"Rang for appointment for 3 weeks of painful hands, after several calls back advised Pharmacist who gave moisturiser but also said ring 111.   More calls to and from 111  advised  antihistamine for symptoms and call GP after weekend.  Many more calls and changed antihistamine for something stronger (which isn't)  and keep using cream.  A few different diagnosis from these calls,  arthritis, dry skin, neurological pain and allergy.   How about a blood test?"
Cardinal,No Access,5/18/2022,2,"No matter what I do, I cannot get to speak to anyone. AskMyGP is shut. I phone in and you are waiting for ages and I cannot when I am at work. It is not working and they need to listen to what is the reality. I know they are short staffed, so this needs higher intervention or those that are here, will leave as it must be difficult. I need to see a GP and will end up having to go to A&E and that is no good for anyone!"
Cardinal,No appointment available for sick child,10/19/2021,1,"Called 8am when opened number 50 in queue, hour on phone, went in person to Deben road told no appointment available for a sick child who was advised by 111 to have urgent appointment"
Cardinal,No follow ups.,7/11/2022,2,"My mum has a problem with her right leg. I have on numerous occasions contacted the surgery about this.She has been seen by a clinical practitioner,and they tell you she will have follow ups,nothing comes of it, ridiculous. My mum is 87,lives alone and I her daughter live in Hampshire. Too many patients,not enough staff!! Seriously need someone to sort out this problem,before a patient is critically ill. It feels as if there is no support,for the individual,that is sad."
Cardinal,Not a service,5/18/2022,1,"This is not a service. A service it when you get something. I and my family are getting nothing, we have had to go to A&E as even 111 could not get us in. the physical doors may be open now but that means nothing. AskMyGP submissions, ignored. Telephone access, impossible as we get cut off. Not sure what we are supposed to do when this happens and desperate for help."
Cardinal,Not being able to speak or see a dr when need,5/19/2022,1,"I asked my gp Friday and it’s now  Thursday, still not sorted."
Cardinal,NOT GOOD,3/15/2022,1,TRIED TO SEND EMAIL TO WWW.CARDINALMEDICALPRACTICE.CO.UK WEB ADDRESS DID NOT WORK
Cardinal,Not good enough,5/31/2022,1,I wasn’t told that my blood test results showed I had got Glandular fever. 6 weeks later when I called them as I still wasn’t well with a very swollen and sore throat and neck they then told me. I have probably passed it on to many people as I wasn’t aware they just kept telling me it was probably long covid. I have called several times as I’ve been so unwell but it was never mentioned.
Cardinal,Not great in afternoon,5/19/2023,3,"On the day this morning was ok using AskMyGP and I am in quite quickly as a response. It is in the afternoon that things are not as great as AskMyGP is generally switched off by about 9am, in my experience and the phone ques are very long and all appointments are going. I have never been offered a GP appointment once yet since being here for last couple of years."
Cardinal,Not replying to enquiries,4/29/2022,1,Was asked to contact surgery re medication review. I used ask my gp. Email eventually sent back saying reception would be in contact to make an appointment.  This was 10 days ago. Nobody has phoned or made contact.
Cardinal,Notification needed,11/18/2021,4,I used AskMyGP and made the request to be seen the following Friday. There is no follow up to let you know that that has happened when I submit it. The system is very easy to use and much faster than hanging on the telephone. I have appointment here (Deben Road) after a separate submission earlier today.
Cardinal,One hour and a half in a queue!,9/11/2021,1,Absolutely appalling having to wait in a queue for one and a half hours to speak to a receptionist. Phoning for my 90 year old mother who doesn’t understand the system! No wonder people are over using our struggling A&E!!!
Cardinal,Ongoing access issues with AskMyGP,8/3/2023,1,"Since the previous feedback in early February about the state of AskMyGP at Cardinal Medical Practice, the practice has continued with its strategy of early shutdown of online access to patient appointments almost every day. In recent days, the shutdown message has subtly changed from a ""lack of routine appointment slots"" to concerns about ""reaching a safe limit"". If, by its own admission, the practice is borderline unsafe, should this ring alarm bells? Should the public reasonably expect a second opinion from an organisation that is focussed on patient safety i.e. an urgent unannounced inspection from the CQC? One also has to question whether the decision/judgement by the GP partners at Cardinal to admit in public to safety concerns at their own practice was a wise one?

Whatever the messaging from Cardinal, the root cause of the problem is obviously a lack of clinicians. In late 2020, prior to the merger of the Norwich Road, Chesterfield Drive and the Deben Road surgeries into Cardinal Medical Practice, there was a public consultation about the proposed merger. Two important outcomes from that consultation exercise were the fact that patients were concerned about telephone access and a lack of GP appointments. In the formal merger proposition submitted by Cardinal and Suffolk Primary Care (SPC) - who were driving the merger and are ultimately responsible for the overall running of Cardinal Medical Practice - they specifically promised more Care Navigators and more GP sessions, and this was discussed at the PCCC meeting in February 2021. HealthWatch Suffolk were present at that PCCC meeting, and the matter was reported at the time in the EADT. In 9 2021, just over six months after those promises were made, Cardinal was referred by the local MP to the CQC for, among other things, failing to provide adequate telephone access for its patients. And now, two years on, we still have a situation where the GP partners at Cardinal are clearly failing to employ enough clinicians to satisfy patient demand. What is the point of a public consultation and the contractual promises made by Cardinal and SPC if nobody is prepared to hold Cardinal and SPC to account?

Also at the PCCC meeting in February 2021, there was a comment from one member of the PCCC panel that if a practice serving 30,000 patients were to fail it would present major problems for the local CCG, and an assertion from the chair of the PCCC that such a practice might be deemed to large to fail. Do these observations allude to the real reason as to why we are not seeing the IESCCG / SNEE ICB taking robust/decisive action to resolve issues at Cardinal? Why has there not been any follow-up assessment of Cardinal Medical Practice from the CQC following Cardinal's ""Requires Improvement"" rating from nearly a year ago? If the practice is unsafe and continues to be unsafe, at what stage will the IESCCG / SNEE ICB / CQC intervene and take action (i.e. implement a regime change) to protect the public?"
Cardinal,Outstanding service and care,5/13/2022,5,"I have been a patient at Norwich Road Surgery for over 23 years, during which time I have had to call on their help a number of times. I’m autistic and have other mental health issues, the care I have received has saved my life, one particular GP has stood with me as I faced numerous battles, he is dedicated, sincere and supportive. A couple of months ago, a suspicious sore appeared on my arm, from diagnosis to the removal of the cancer was less than 4 weeks. Every contact I have had at the surgery has been positive"
Cardinal,Over an hour waiting to speak to someone,11/16/2021,1,Awful- couldn't do the ask a GP as it wouldn't accept my log in details despite me using them for repeat prescriptions every month for over a year.
Cardinal,Painful bowels,2/15/2022,1,"Terrible customer service, incorrectly prescribed medication even after we told them about allergies, phone queue over 35 min wait rubbish."
Cardinal,Phone is terrible trying to get through,11/16/2021,3,Can’t get through sometimes get cut off. Also can’t get an appointment for months so quite bad at the moment.
Cardinal,Phone line issue,11/18/2021,3,"I am unable to use AskMyGP so walked into Deben Road today as I need an appointment.  They were unable to do that. It was explained to me by HWS staff who were there that the calls go to Chesterfield Drive and they all use the AskMyGP form, which I appreciate, however, when I ring the phone ends up being hung up. (It was explained that the system is digital and there can sometimes be gliches, as no member of staff would hang up).  
I will now try and ring later this afternoon now that this has all been explained to me, and hope it works then as cannot go online."
Cardinal,Poor communication,8/17/2022,1,"Received a text on Friday to discuss blood test results, I read it after the surgery had closed due to being asleep due to working nights.
On Monday I contacted via AMGP at 8am requesting call back ideally by 10am mentioning that I work nights and need to sleep. No response by 10am so I submitted another request explaining I was going to sleep and to contact my via email with the results, I received a fairly prompt response saying I was “down to be called today”. Stayed up until midday and couldn’t keep awake any longer so went to sleep. Received a missed call around 5pm and a follow up message once again asking to contact the surgery to discuss results and also to book a follow up blood test. 
On Tuesday I submitted once again on AMGP, this time requesting a call after 5pm, again explaining I work nights and sleep daytime. Upon waking up I see I have replies on AMGP explaining the results and to contact surgery again after having the second blood test. Why could this not have been explained in the first instance?  Disrupted my sleep pattern and added unnecessary anxiety."

Cardinal,Poor communication!,6/26/2022,1,Have wait over an hour to speak to care navigator only to be told get an appointment via AskGP icon!
Cardinal,"Poor communication, can't get an appt",5/24/2022,1,"I was in Chesterfield Drive Surgery today and the nurse practitioner I saw asked me to make an appt for 2 weeks time to have more re blood tests and another blood pressure test-receptionist got annoyed with me and told me that I have to go on Ask My GP! I got the nurse to ask her for me and as soon as the nurse left, receptionist got annoyed again, told me to wait and that she had to go upstairs - she came back with an appointment, but it's at a different surgery where nobody knows my history. Continuity of care is very important with ongoing issues and it's no wonder I have waited so long for a partial diagnosis when nobody sees the same health care professional  more than once - very shabby"
Cardinal,Quick  and excellent response,1/31/2022,5,"I have used the askmyGP service several times now and have always had a quick response from the Dr. It was obvious that she had also looked up my medical record and was aware of a number of possible diagnoses. I was very happy with her treatment plan for me and her responses during follow up consultations. 
The Pharmacist also very quickly responded when I needed a meds’ review and was very knowledgeable. Although my medication hasn’t changed I felt that consultation was very worthwhile, as he also explained more about the drugs I am taking."
Cardinal,Quick and responsive,2/5/2023,4,"I found this time that they were very quick and responsive at a very concerning time for me. I had very strange symptoms and called the surgery. I saw a Nurse Practitioner who ordered bloods and had concerns. Rightly so, as suspected a Stroke. It was not that but they ordered a MRI - Had this within a week and a tumour was found, thankfully benign."
Cardinal,Quick and Simple to use,1/31/2022,5,I have used ask my GP several times already and each time have found it to be a quick and efficient service. For those that work full time and not having time to wait on hold it is perfect and I intend to use this moving forward
Cardinal,Quick response,12/21/2021,5,Had a flare up of an old condition and have had to call GP a couple of times over the last few weeks. Had a response within the day every time. Very sympathetic GPs and medication issued.
Cardinal,Really poor communication,2/8/2022,1,"Requested an appointment at 8:15 am as surgery ""now operating an on the day service"". 5 hours later still no further communication ! Very annoying that I have to keep checking my emails and the Cardinal Medical Practice website in case I miss if they finally book me an appointment which very nearly happened previously! 

Of course I could telephone and wait an hour for my call to be answered to then be told to go through Ask my GP ! Not very professional and certainly not a good system. Also very confusing that they say we should request the appointment on the day we are available but then that we may have to wait 1-3 days for a response?"
Cardinal,"Rudness, GDPR issues and long telephone wait",11/29/2021,1,"1. Your phone message has been the same for 6 months + and its nearly 2 minutes in length; after calling today being told you cannot register appointments on the phone and to use the app. Change your first intro message to; we can only book appointments through the askmygp app.

2. When registering in reception your touch screen device leaves the persons details up."
Cardinal,Shambles,11/22/2021,1,New and only way to book an appointment implemented but left in a queue for 1hr and 15mins to be told along with that they couldn't book an appointment and I had to do it online. Maybe the message on the hold music should have been clearer. Feel completely uncared for by this practice no wonder mental health is at an all time low.
Cardinal,Still not adequate ventialtion or masks.,9/30/2022,1,Ipswich hospital has re-introduced masks. Hopefully FFP3 which are designed to protect wearer against airborne transmission of Covid. The hospital is re-introducing masks because *30% of all hospitalisations with Covid are hospital aquired*. Patients are catching Covid while in hospital. And many are dying because of this. Staff here are mostly helpful. But obviously unaware of the dangers posed.
Cardinal,Struggle to get through on phone,11/10/2021,3,I really do find it difficult to get through on the phone and you can be 36 in the queue. It's very difficult to access the surgery and if you turn up to try and book they say you have to call.
Cardinal,Such hard work,7/9/2022,1,"Cannot believe how hard it is to use this ""wonderful "" new service..When you have put you need advice ASAP and they take 48hrs to reply it's terrible.  Especially when the patient has to be admitted to hospital. Please go back to the old system when you could talk to a human it was so much more efficient."
Cardinal,Terrible,4/5/2022,1,"Ask my GP has been down for over a week now & we cant get through on phone line, resorting to A&E when it should be a GP."
Cardinal,Terrible no access for me,5/18/2022,1,"I have now had to re-register with my old surgery (I will not disclose this) out of the area in order to access my post cancer treatment medication! This surgery said I would have to wait 3 weeks as a new patient and would not issue my medication in the meantime. It is disgusting as they are putting lives at risk. No doctor spoke to me, that was just what reception told me. How can they make that judgement?!"
Cardinal,terrible service,12/16/2021,1,"No care given to me as a patient, which is unsettling to say the least."
Cardinal,The ask my GP is useless,3/21/2022,1,i could not book an annual review it is easier via the telephone although the waiting time to be answered are unacceptable
Cardinal,The most horrible practice,11/17/2021,1,"My son got a coronavirus. I made a call to the Norwich Road Surgery, which is a part of Cardinal Practice, asked for a consultation for my son and me because I am pregnant. After three days there is no call. Brilliant service."
Cardinal,The staff are polite and friendly but….,10/11/2021,3,"I find the people who work at the practice are friendly and do their best to help. However, there are often problems with continuity of treatment plans and breakdown of communication between staff. With that said, they do endeavour to resolve your issues if you speak out about them. I’m sure things will get better after the merger is complete."
Cardinal,Too long to get through by phone.,11/20/2021,2,Feel unsupported medically with doctors not attending surgeries.
Cardinal,Too long to get through by phone.,11/15/2021,2,Feel unsupported medically with doctors not attending surgeries.
Cardinal,Tried many times to send an on-line eConsult over the weekend,11/21/2021,1,I would like the results of a lung function test  and a chest  x-ray phone system very poor.
Cardinal,Tried to use ask my GP s said not available,8/18/2022,2,"Rang surgery after ASK MY GP not available and was 21 in a que took over an hour to talk to reception, wife gave symptoms and was told no one could reply to her problem for a day and has tried to get a face to face appointment and they will let us know if it is possible . The service from this surgery leaves a lot to be desired at the moment."
Cardinal,Trying to call - 40 mins in a que,2/11/2021,3,It doesn't seem to matter what time of day I call there is usually always 40+ in the que resulting in being on hold for a long period of time. I never had this issue before the surgeries merged. Apart from this a good service. This makes it even more difficult to get an appointment
Cardinal,trying to speak to this place is a nightmare,1/12/2021,1,"Trying to speak to anyone is a nightmare..this was before the three medical centers joined together .  and is only getting worse, and if  you do get through... there always seems to be a problem with their phones....  ."
Cardinal,Unable to book an appointment here,2/12/2021,1,I'm still unable  to  book  appointment !
Cardinal,Unable to book in to suit me,3/20/2022,1,I wanted to book an appointment when it suited me and to arrange blood tests but was unable to even though it was a week away.
Cardinal,unable to get a face to face with GP,12/14/2021,1,75 year old female with cancer of the lung & myelofibrosis a blood condition a Hernia with difficulties unable to have a face to face with a qualified GP
Cardinal,Unable to speak to someone about cholesterol,11/4/2022,1,"A letter sent from the surgery on 15/2/22 identified that I had a cholesterol problem, 3 sets of blood tests taken and as of today I have had and cannot obtain any information on my problem. I need to speak to someone who can tell me what the issue is and what is the way forward."
Cardinal,Unacceptable telephone call waiting times,8/11/2021,1,"I have been a patient with this practice for many years now. Since these three surgeries merged, the customer care and service is awful. I just tried to call and was told I am number 36 in the queue - how do you manage to speak with someone when you work full-time and have limited time available to make calls to your doctor's surgery? I can use e-Consult but the questions are completely irrelevant and just send me round and round in circles which is incredibly frustrating."
Cardinal,Used ask my gp for some help regarding back pain,8/8/2022,1,Have made contact to try and get help for back pain to be told to go to the pharmacy had back pain for over a week yet pharmacy medications can only be used max of 3 days
Cardinal,used AskMyGP & ok,5/18/2022,3,"I have had hit and miss with AskMyGP. Sometimes it is working and I get a message or call the same day/48hrs. Other times it has been closed down. My gripe is, don't say it will be 24 hours if it won't be."
Cardinal,"Used on line system, very good",12/13/2021,5,A return call from surgery within an hour of my on line request took the anxiety out of my problem. Very good.
Cardinal,Useless and no continuity of care,4/19/2022,1,"I have been suffering with back pain for 2 weeks. I avoid contacting the surgery to begin with using the pharmacy but when the pain became too much I contacted the surgery. They prescribed me something that had no effect. They then left it to the gp out of hours service they told me to contact my surgery when it reopens because they have to see you. Today I tried again, they have prescribed a medication I’ve tried before that hasn’t worked on ask my gp outside of its operating hours so I can’t reply."
Cardinal,Very bad.,4/28/2022,1,"Long phone waits, no response on emails, unhelpful  surgery staff, always understaffed, never follow up on issues, not keen on actually seeing the patient. I ended up taken to the hospital from my work place and Cardinal medical practice lost my notes from hospital, wouldn't see me, refused to book me an emergency blood test."
Cardinal,Very difficult for people without IT skills,4/13/2022,1,"Very slow to get a response at times, I would rather speak to someone than virtually especially for my health. I find it really impersonal."
Cardinal,Very easy to use,11/18/2021,5,"As someone from the older generation, I cannot recommend this enough. It was so frustrating trying to get through on the telephone before now, but this morning I put this form in and within an hour they got in touch and got me in to the Chesterfield drive site. It was so quick and easy to use."
Cardinal,Very poor patient liaison,11/15/2021,1,"Quicker to visit than phone, Far too long for test results resulting in non activity of problem."
Cardinal,Very rude GP,11/30/2021,1,"System to talk to a GP has changed with no communication from the surgery. The new system encourages you to state what you think the problem is and a doctor then calls me and rudely tells me I shouldn't 'make statements' about having a suspected disease. Think about your systems, your communication and your approach. Really awful!"
Cardinal,Very rude lady answering phone,11/15/2021,1,I phoned for an appointment the woman was very rude shouted on phone at me 3 times as I requested a certain nurse to see.
Cardinal,very well run practice,7/10/2021,5,"norwich rd surgery has always maintained the highest standards, and i have no doubt the new combined practice will continue as such."
Cardinal,Wasted my time.,9/22/2022,1,"Made a telephone appointment without my knowledge, text me to remind me and then cancelled without informing me."
Cardinal,website for me is impossible to access,3/10/2022,1,"website impossible to use i cannot log in to order repeat medication,doctors appointments, it seems that it must have only G mail  requests, I do not have a g mail account and do not want to change  my existing e mail account, your telephone land line is usually always engaged,"
Cardinal,Wife couldn't get logged on 'ASKMyGp',11/22/2021,2,"My wife needed to login (to the new 'AskMyGp') to see what was going on with her prescription review - she had been told different things on the phone by two people at the surgery - one said she would get a call back (which never happened) and the other said that wasn't necessary and issued the repeat prescription anyway. When she went online her details and request options were all greyed out.  When she tried to register for 'AskMyGp' for the first time it rejected her passwords and said her email address was already taken!  She had to call and stay on the line for ages to ask them to sort it out - they have gone away to look into it.  I managed to login for the first time after a bit of a struggle, though it wouldn't accept what was a reasonably secure password - I had to use the random letters suggested by my computer to get it to work.  I used to work in IT and tested these sort of systems - goodness knows how the less tech savvy will get on with it!  If you say anything to the staff they just repeat the very basic instructions which my wife already knew, and had followed. They don't see that there are issues and likely a lack of testing/quality. Hopefully it will at least be an improvement over having to stay on the line for over an hour just to pass a simple message."
Cardinal,Wife has 15 wasps stings to the face head ces,7/27/2022,1,Phoned up cardinal surgery at 0800 told to go to the chemist.chemist said Sting's are so severe.that my wife should see the doctor.my wife got Intouch with the doctor at cardinal surgery again.and was told a doctor will be in touch.no doctor called.my wife then phoned the . cardinal surgery every 2hrs .to find out if there was a doctor coming.i phoned the cardinal surgery at 1802.and was told to phone 111 if no doctor has got in touch by 1830.by this time my wife was in so much pain.now 111 have so many calls we are in a 45 to 1 HR waiting time. So my wife was waiting 10hrs for a call from a doctor who never has been stung by one wasp let alone 15 to the head.
Cardinal,Yearly blood tests and health check,11/22/2021,5,'AskMYGp' is good for getting an appt. Nurse very friendly and helpful
Chesterfield,2 star,6/10/2015,2,Never satisfied with treatment.
Chesterfield,3 Star,9/16/2015,3,3 Stars
Chesterfield,5 star,9/16/2015,5,5 star
Chesterfield,5 Star,9/16/2015,5,None
Chesterfield,A brilliant surgery,7/16/2015,5,"A brilliant surgery, excellent staff and fantastic on site pharmacy."
Chesterfield,Absolutely awful patient response times -,6/14/2021,1,"On the phone for 45 mins so far. My mum is partially sighted with memory issues. If she didn't have my support to try to GET actual medical support then she would fall through the huge cracks appearing in the service levels at this GP centre. I really feel for anyone needing to use this service if they are on their own, suffering from mental health issues/ anxiety because this is far too difficult for some to negotiate their way through to get help.  I have had to cancel a meeting to be able to wait an hour just to get through on the phone - my mum wouldn't have been able to do this as she would have forgotten why she was on the phone which enforces the concerns raised above."
Chesterfield,All good for me,2/13/2019,5,"I don't need to come in very often but when I do it has all been good for me. Friendly faces and professional service, I can't think of anything that I would look to change! Proposed new site is probably no further than I already travel so I will certainly go there when they move."
Chesterfield,All great since I moved here!,1/23/2019,4,It has all been great since I moved here - no complaints as such. My only quibble is that I used to be able to get two months medication on one prescription at my previous surgery and here I can only get one.
Chesterfield,always there to help,5/1/2018,4,"The majority of the staff really seem to care and go above and beyond to help. They are very accommodating and understanding and will always allow you to choose who you wish to see. One Doctor is a credit to the practice and is the first GP I've had that actually felt like they were on my side and didn't dismiss my input and opinions. My only qualm is that Mental Health link workers are never there! I have had at least 5 appointments booked with them all of which have been cancelled via letter. when I call the receptionists re book the appointment only to receive yet another cancellation letter, as someone who struggles to an extreme extent with poor mental health this can be extremely distressing."
Chesterfield,Always time to listen,5/28/2016,4,My doctor always finds time to listen to all that I have to say
Chesterfield,Appointments lost you a star.!!!,10/18/2018,4,"Once upon a time there was a brilliant surgery with a brilliant online system. You used to be able to log in,select your time and doctor to suit, then log out. It was great and everyone was happy. But one day something happened and the online system was bewitched and it became virtually impossible to book an appointment unless you waited 5-6 weeks. The only other option was to try to ring in 8.00 am the next day, along with the dozens of other patients wanting to be seen. Alas dear patients, this is where our sad story ends because nobody has cured the poor online system. It still languishes online, accessible but useless unless you are psychic and can predict a future ailment and the need to see a doctor."
Chesterfield,Are blood tests available?,7/22/2021,2,Since the last phlebotomist left I don't know if the surgery carries out blood tests.  I sent an email to ask if they do and if so how I can book.  Have not been told.  Received a phone call from a withheld number and caller hung up before I could answer.  If everyone needing a test has to go to the hospital or Landseer Road this must cause a huge increase in traffic.  The delay in responding to phone calls is unacceptable.  If blood tests are carried out an online booking system is needed.
Chesterfield,at least a 30 min wait,5/31/2016,3,There is always at least a 30 min. wait when I get to the practice. It is clean although there is very little in the way of community info.
Chesterfield,At least a 30 minute wait,5/29/2016,3,The surgey is very clean but I always have at least a 30 minute wait when I go. Also there isn't very much community info. in the practice
Chesterfield,Been here for years,2/13/2019,5,"I have been registered here for years-all my life really so I don't have much to compare it to. I think they do very, very well. The receptionists are all so helpful and try to fit you in. It has gotten busier and busier over the years but they manage well. I will certainly travel when they move. I drive here so a few more minutes in the car won't make much difference-my overall journey might even be quicker if there is good parking because that is difficult here."
Chesterfield,"Brilliant, really happy here",11/2/2019,5,"I drive so there will be no problem for me to get to the new site, in fact it will be closer to where I work. I moved house and registered here. It is brilliant, I am really happy here and my mother, father and sister have all registered here as a result of my very positive experience."
Chesterfield,Can't get in,6/3/2016,3,Can't get in to see a doctor for at least a week.
Chesterfield,Child with high temperature and painful ear i,2/19/2019,1,"From early morning I called and explained that the child was sick, the temperature was high and the ear was very painful, the child was crying from pain all night. We received an appointment only at 16:00. We arrived two hours earlier because the child did not stop crying. I ask them to take us before, explained that it is very painful. Nobody was worried about it, so I spent two hours in the waiting room with a crying child, until the doctor gives us two minutes of her time to prescribe antibiotics."
Chesterfield,Difficult to get an appointment,12/5/2015,2,"Getting an appointment at the surgery is difficult, I've had to wait 3 weeks to see a diabetic nurse at the surgery. The Nurse asked  me to book an appointment next week but when I asked at reception They said none were available."
Chesterfield,Difficult to get through on phone,6/27/2023,3,I find that it is very difficult to get through to them on the phone. I have used the online access for them but I would prefer to speak with them. The GP's are limited and I find there is no consistency in seeing the same doctor.
Chesterfield,Don`t recommend,2/19/2019,1,"Don`t recommend,  poor service"
Chesterfield,Don't recomend,2/19/2019,1,Bad experience
Chesterfield,Drs & Nurses friendly but wait time is awful,6/3/2020,1,"The doctors and nurses are lovely, but it is nearly impossible to ever get an appointment and sometimes you have to wait over a month to see a doctor/nurse! Plus, you can only book an appointment or get a message to a doctor over the telephone, and, to give you an example of how poor the telephone waiting times are, I have just been on the phone to them and I had to wait 51 minutes to speak to someone. It's a painful experience."
Chesterfield,Drs should all work full time,11/2/2019,4,"I will move with the practice to the new site as and when. i do hope the appointment system will be better. It is about three weeks now for a routine appointment and I think that is too long. I don't like the 'on the day' phone queue system, I think Drs should all work full time as this would resolve most of these issues."
Chesterfield,Excellent,8/15/2016,5,An appointment will be made the day you phone.  You see a practice nurse which is very good
Chesterfield,Flu Jab,1/11/2016,4,I wanted a flu jab as I have thyroid problems.  I asked at the surgery and was told I was too young so I made an appointment to see my doctor who was really good and I got my flu jab so I feel I can keep myself well.
Chesterfield,Friendly surgery but long waiting times,3/15/2018,3,Staff extremely friendly - reception staff in particular go the extra mile! However waiting times long - told 5 - 6 week wait for a regular appointment although was offered the chance to ring in on the day. This may be difficult as I work full time!
Chesterfield,Frustrating,9/14/2021,1,You simply cannot get through.  It's appalling
Chesterfield,Generally OK here,11/2/2019,4,After the move it will be harder for me to get to the new site as I have poor mobility but I will give it a  go as I can probably get a lift form a family member. Generally I feel it is OK here.
Chesterfield,Generally see the doctor I want to see.,3/15/2016,4,Generally I get to see the doctor I want to for non urgent appointments. The waiting to see a doctor are not bad and reception will keep you informed if they are running behind.
Chesterfield,Get seen by nurse and misdiagnosed,4/22/2016,3,"On two separate occasions one being my husband and the other being my son (in his 30's) needed to see a GP. My son had back pain and could barely walk well. The GP was busy and he was told he could see the nurse. She did not even examine him, said it would pass as probably a strained muscle. He was prescribed low strength pain killers.2 days later still in agony he went to A & E. There were able to conclude that it was a bone issue not a muscle issue, and he was prescribed higher strength pain killers.
A similar situation happened with my husband. I do know others that have seen the nurse instead of a doctor and it concerns me as they too were misdiagnosed. 
As GP appointments are harder and harder to get it seems that our nurses are being given more responsibilities that they never used too have."
Chesterfield,Good access & helpful receptionists,10/12/2017,5,Can't fault the surgery. You can ring in the morning and most of the time you will get an appointment that day. The receptionists are friendly and helpful. It works well for me.
Chesterfield,Good and helpful,5/31/2016,5,"They are good and helpful in the surgery, the receptionist is really nice and also helpful."
Chesterfield,Good diagnosis,7/23/2015,5,Grateful my GP diagnosed my condition and takes time to come and see me and deal with me personally. But receptionists are like guardians of the doctor. GP good.
Chesterfield,Great-friendly,5/28/2016,4,"Great, friendly Drs on the day team. Bit too long waiting for a non emergency appointment"
Chesterfield,Happy here,2/13/2019,4,"I am happy here and I will move with the practice to Took's as I drive and it looks as if parking will be much easier. I am much reassured that I will be able to see the same nurses/doctors as I have always had positive experiences and trust them. I know this isn't the fault of the practice and I don't know how they could do much about it but my visit today with my son was marred by two young men who evidently knew each other and who used very bad language to each other, and all else in the waiting room, to express their disapproval of people being seen before they were. Not what I wanted my son to hear!"
Chesterfield,Happy to travel here,2/13/2019,5,I used to use Landseer Road and now come here. I looked at practices closer to where I live and asked friends/neighbours about where they went. What I heard wasn't too positive and so I decided to give it a go here and it has worked well so far. I will certainly go to the new site as and when.
Chesterfield,Happy with the doctors,8/15/2016,4,Patient has visit made in sheltered housing and does not visit surgery.  I live in a care home and do not go to the surgery.  I am generally happy with the doctor who visits me.  Also with the hospital service
Chesterfield,Helpful and caring,9/12/2020,5,"When I had an operation and need my staples removing, doctor was gentle and considerate to how much pain I was in, I have always found them understanding, I feel I have been treated kindly in the surgery"
Chesterfield,Helpful and kind,8/9/2016,4,The staff that I have come in contact with have been helpful and kind. I don't feel like I have to be nervous or embarrassed about anything
Chesterfield,I always get an appointment,6/18/2016,5,I can always get an appointment when I need one. This is not very often for me or my children
Chesterfield,I am fairly happy,2/19/2019,4,Generally I am fairly happy here but I do think that some of the doctors could be less dismissive of me asking about a second condition during a consultation. I then have to make a second appointment which wastes everyone's time. And that is a shame because everything else is pretty satisfactory. I will transfer to the new site as it isn't much further for me and I don't really much fancy the alternative surgeries that I could transfer to.
Chesterfield,I am well looked after here,11/2/2019,4,I feel that I am well looked after here. I have no issue with getting appointments and staff are friendly and professional. I currently have a two minute walk to this practice so I will have to drive which is shame but there will be parking so it will be doable.
Chesterfield,I can't complain overall.,8/3/2019,4,"I find that the GPs are variable, but the booking system means that often I can't access appointments with those that I consider the best ones. I am registered as a carer for my husband but I don't get longer appointments. One GP was really awful, dementia during a consultation. When I mentioned the difficulties I was experiencing I was shocked and brought to the point of tears to be told 'if you can't manage put him in a home'. It was awful especially as I was struggling anyway. Despite that one bad incident I can't complain overall and we will both move to the new premises with the practice."
Chesterfield,I have always been happy,2/19/2019,5,I have been registered here for years!! I don't come that often but I have always been happy when I have had to come. I will be happy to move to the new site as it is about the same distance as I am from here. I have to say it looks very impressive.
Chesterfield,I Love it here,2/13/2019,5,I'm always a few minutes late going in but despite that I love it here!  and wouldn't change surgeries. They picked up breast cancer and had me into Ipswich Hospital in very short time where I was quickly sorted out. Very reassuring that! I'll move when the new surgery opens as it is a bit closer to me. That said I would have been happy to travel further to remain with them.
Chesterfield,I will certainly move with the Practice.,2/19/2019,4,I will certainly move with them to the new Tooks site as and when. Getting there isn't a problem for me getting there and the building looks good. If there is an issue it is around timeliness-I came in to make an appointment to have my ears syringed in Sept last year and was seen towards the end of November. I know it isn't a top priority/emergency but that is quite a wait. There are pretty good at calling me in for routine stuff though.
Chesterfield,I'm currently 29th in the queue,3/8/2021,2,"When you are having medical issues and you need to book an appointment or chase something, constantly having to wait hours to get through isn't always an option. I have been suffering with anxiety and depression and this inflames the situation"
Chesterfield,It's all good for me,8/3/2019,4,It is all good for me and I will move with the practice when it moves. I really rate the doctors and nurses so I am pleased that I will still be able to see them. I drive so the increased parking available at the new site is really good news.
Chesterfield,It's easy enough to get appointments,5/28/2016,5,It's easy enough to get appointments but I always have to wait when I arrive. They are always running late
Chesterfield,Long trip to here,2/13/2019,4,I was a patient at Landseer Road for years and years and I transferred here when it closed. It has been a long trip today to get here. My daughter brings me and she lives in Felixstowe so it is the wrong side of town for her so I don't know whether I would move to the new site with them or not. Was happy at Landseer Road though.
Chesterfield,Long wait for appointment,11/17/2016,2,Waiting for appointment to see own GP can take 3 - 4 weeks
Chesterfield,Long wait for appointments,3/13/2018,3,"Getting an appointment used to be quite easy, now there are rarely any at all on the 6 weeks available to book online. Ringing up is easier but often very long wait on the 'phone. I've often been given an appointment 6 weeks hence.  Doctors are good when you do get in but the wait is too long."
Chesterfield,Look after me reasonably well,11/2/2019,4,When the surgery moves I may transfer with it. I am not sure as there is another practice closer to where I now live so I may try to move there. I have been here all my life and I consider they look after me reasonably well so I would only transfer for reasons of geography.
Chesterfield,look after me well,5/31/2016,5,They are very good and they look after me well.
Chesterfield,Lovely practice. All staff very helpful,4/26/2019,5,"Not happy with the online appointment system. I like to see my own GP, but there are usually no appointments available using the online service."
Chesterfield,Lovely surgey,5/28/2016,4,this is a lovely surgery however wait times can be awful sometimes
Chesterfield,Merger - WRONG,9/12/2020,1,"Chesterfield Drive should not be allowed to merge with other surgeries.  They merged with Landseer Road and said they would keep things the same, then shut the surgery.  We were told lack of Doctors but nothing has changed at Chesterfield Drive."
Chesterfield,Much about this practice is very good,8/3/2019,4,Much about this practice is very good in my experience but I have noticed some issues: I am called in for some annual reviews but not others. I don't get prompts for medication reviews for example. I would welcome email communication which I feel would be a real improvement for me. The proposed new site is closer to where I live so I will transfer to the new site when they move.
Chesterfield,My doctor is very good,2/18/2019,4,My doctor is very good and spends as much time as is needed with me but that means I am often late going in . I have also had some of the new doctors who have examined me and don't know what to do and have had to leave the room to get assistance.
Chesterfield,My problem wasn't resolved.,1/11/2016,3,My problem wasn't resolved .  The appointment was for my son.  I've been going on and off with him for 4 months but GP says it's because he's a child and it will resolve itself.  I think the GP should do more and take it more seriously - do tests or something.  2 weeks wait to see my preferred GP
Chesterfield,Never getting an appointment,5/28/2019,2,Doctors are ok if you can ever get an appointment. Many times where there had been no appointment available at all or where you are in the queue and get cut off and lose your place. The whole system is ridiculous.
Chesterfield,New Patient - Superb Experience,1/25/2019,5,"Having just changed surgeries due to moving house and very dissatisfied with my old surgery, I was very nervous about moving surgeries as I had been at my last one since birth (a very long time now!) It had gone down hill a lot and staff were rude and there always seemed to be an issue.  Luckily I rarely need to visit the Doctor.

I can honestly say first impressions from the 4 times I have had contact including a Nurse appointment, telephone contact and visits with regards to new patient forms, myself and my Fiance are really pleased to have changed over.  Staff have been friendly and superbly helpful fitting me in at short notice for a smear appointment which was overdue from my last surgery as I just didn't want to go there.

It really is a shame that the catchment area doesn't include my parents' side of town as I would love them to come here, also because of terrible treatment at their surgery.

Overall, so far we are very impressed all round and keep up the great work!"
Chesterfield,No face to face appts,8/15/2021,1,"Long wait on phone to even speak to receptionist- often being 34th or more in queue. Then to be told no appointments. I, like many people my age, just don’t bother, even if needing to see/speak to someone. GP rang me as I sent econsult. How can medication be prescribed without seeing the patient, especially someone who rarely attends, plus having mental health issues."
Chesterfield,No GP appointments and unhelpful prescribing,1/13/2019,2,"There are never any GP appointments available. Prescribing by the doctors is very unhelpful.  Why prescribe for only 28 days rather than 56?  The patient has to waste a lot of time ordering, travelling to and from the pharmacy and waiting in a queue to be served (I had to wait for about 30 minutes yesterday).  Due to a medication review I lost a 28 day supply of one of my drugs.  I made two requests for an extra supply and was ignored."
Chesterfield,No patient care,8/17/2020,1,"5 yr old CHILD suffering from GERD since birth, nothing has been diagnosed,no investigations, just given most common, cheapest medicine and told he will grow out of it!! Disgusting to make a child suffer for years awful treatment."
Chesterfield,No problem for me,11/2/2019,4,I have a bit of an issue with blood tests-I can never get in here so I end up going to the Riverside which is a bit of a trek. Overall though they look after me very well. I am quite happy at the proposed move-the building looks very impressive in the visuals. There will be no problem for me.
Chesterfield,"No problems with appointments, good surgery",5/22/2017,5,"No problems getting appointments unless you particularly want to to see a specific GP.  All round a good surgery, A really great surgery."
Chesterfield,Not good,8/4/2021,1,Telephone lines are busy all day long and the wait is extreme. Will not see any one in person still and its now 2021. Never been to speak to a GP. Frustrated as 3 surgeries have merged so now can not move to a different oe
Chesterfield,Not very good,6/10/2015,1,They won't come out and see me - I have to go to them even when I feel very poorly. I can't walk very well or far.
Chesterfield,OK for us,2/19/2019,4,We decided to move into Town from a village to be closer to facilities as we got a bit older. We have been pretty happy as patients here. The new site is a bit further for us but we still drive so it will be ok for us and we will move with the practice.
Chesterfield,OK so far,2/13/2019,4,"I was at Landseer Road (now closed) and I was happy overall, this is my first trip to Chesterfield Drive and I was able to make an appointment away from the rush hour traffic. I got the appointment in a reasonable time and I will continue to be registered here up till the move. Whether I go to Took's or not will depend much on how things progress between now and then."
Chesterfield,One of the better ones,5/28/2016,4,this surgery is one of the better ones! Waiting times could improve but there is a useful pharmacy
Chesterfield,Polite staff,5/28/2016,5,very polite staff who are clear on what they are doing
Chesterfield,Poor,9/30/2019,2,The surgery isn't great
Chesterfield,Poor service,12/17/2020,1,"Very long wait time on the phone to get through to speak to someone, very hard to get an appointment, website is all jumbled up and hard to read."
Chesterfield,Prescription ready within few hours.,12/22/2020,5,"Rang at 3pm, nurse called back about 5pm. Collected meds at 6pm. Fantastic service."
Chesterfield,Problem should be investigated further,7/15/2016,3,"To be taken more seriously and the need for further investigation to be taken.  It is easy to make an appointment by phone.  The staff are polite, but it would be better if the GP could take me a more seriously sometimes.  Last time I took my son who was having problems with aching bones. He was told to take multivitamins.  This has helped a little , but I have booked an appointment to go back as he still has the problem.  I think the problem should be investigated further."
Chesterfield,Quite happy with the clinical aspects,2/19/2019,4,The Took's site is closer to my home so I will probably move with the practice. Overall I am quite happy with the clinical aspects of the practice but in my experience the reception staff can come over as a bit dismissive when I talk to them on the 'phone. I have been a bit late being called in a couple of times but nothing to really speak of.
Chesterfield,Reception glitch,2/13/2019,5,"I really rate this practice, I am happy to be a patient here. Appointments are pretty reasonable and all the doctors/nurses that I have seen have been very good. There was a glitch today however, for some reason I couldn't book in at the screen so I got into the small queue at reception. The receptionist was trying to book in a baby to see a clinician that afternoon following a health visitor's advice. Resolving this took some time and the queue got longer and longer which I think flustered the receptionist. Maybe a system for someone else in the practice to take up more complicated issues from reception would be more efficient? Just a thought."
Chesterfield,Reception staff try to diagnose,4/18/2016,4,Reception staff try to diagnose and medically advise. I've got fibromyalgia but before it was diagnosed my notes said I as a hypochondriac and this has influenced how other staff have treated me. Since the diagnosis things have changed and I get the support I need. In the past the quality of care I received wasn't good but now its great.
Chesterfield,Receptionists are really helpful,11/2/2019,5,I transferred here when the Landseer Road branch closed last year. This is my first visit since the closure and I drove here this morning and it took 50 minutes!! The appointment was easy enough to get-receptionists are really helpful. When Tooks open I may well transfer elsewhere as the journey will be even further.
Chesterfield,Ring doctor,8/31/2021,2,I am in queue number 29 when I reach 21 I get cut off this is a regular occurence and I feel like giving up as no proper health care
Chesterfield,Rude Nurse Practitioner,5/25/2018,1,"I asked the Nurse Practitioner - if I could talk about having an allergy test. They said I have no time and was quite rude. They said that I would have to talk to the receptionist. They said you can only talk about one problem. When I talked to the receptionist they said this is not my job you need to talk to the GP.

The practitioner told me that I needed to pay for an allergy test but the receptionist said the GP will decide what you need to do. I have been to the surgery 6 times about this allergy problem and no one seems to want to help. I have found them very rude."
Chesterfield,Seen straight away,5/28/2016,5,On my last visit we were given an emergency appointment and seen straight away
Chesterfield,Since you have reorganised your web page,7/17/2020,3,"Since you have re-organized you're web page, specifically the repeat prescriptions, navigation of the rout to ordering the prescriptions are difficult to read and does not STAND OUT where you have to click."
Chesterfield,Staff are friendly,8/16/2018,5,20 past 10 appointment - I was seen 30 minutes later. Reception staff are friendly. GP is friendly.
Chesterfield,Staff pleasant and helpful despite how busy,7/28/2021,4,"Good, Staff are pleasant and helpful despite how busy."
Chesterfield,Suits me very well,11/2/2019,5,I get driven by my family to my appointments so the parking at the new site will make things easier. I have been a patient for more than 30 years and it suits me very well. And when my husband needed home visits they were always there on the day-can't ask for more. I saw a nurse (here) last Wednesday and she was very thorough and took all the time that was needed.
Chesterfield,Superb!,9/26/2018,5,I don't go very often (which suits me well!) however the few contacts that I have had with the surgery have been superb
Chesterfield,Surgery is quite good,8/12/2016,4,"The surgery is quite good generally.  The parking is a little limited but it would be difficult for them to do much.  
Everything is alright"
Chesterfield,Terrible service in the last 4 months,3/28/2021,2,Unable to speak with a doctor for 3 months for any member of my family. Constantly shoved towards nurse practitioners who have no personal understanding of long term conditions.
Chesterfield,The surgery is good,6/9/2016,5,The surgery is good and I don't have any problems getting appointments.  You don't get to see your own doctor all the time but this is to be expected.
Chesterfield,They are brilliant,6/13/2016,5,I ring most regularly about my mum and they are brilliant. They understand what I'm going through and I will miss my GP when he retires.
Chesterfield,To access appointments has been appalling..,8/25/2021,1,"After listening to the same recorded messges for several minutes at each call. Then to be cut off because all lines are busy for over three days at different times of the day - even when instructed to call after 2pm the same happened.  

On day 4, being told I am number 30 in the queue is totally unacceptable. I had to rate 1 star to complete this, but would not award any stars. I would be interested in joining a patients group if it will influence the terrible service offered to patients."
Chesterfield,Transferring closer to home.,2/13/2019,3,"I am here for the first time as I used to be a patient at Landseer Road (now closed). My journey today for a routine appt. has made me realise that I probably wouldn't feel able to get here if I felt really poorly. So, I will be looking to transfer to a doctor closer to home soon and I won't be going to the new site which is even further to me. I feel it is a shame because I have always been happy with how I have been looked after, I am defeated by the geography. Hence my lowish scoring of the practice."
Chesterfield,Treated with dignity and respect,1/11/2016,5,GP v. empathetic.  I try to see them when I need to see a GP. I feel like I'm treated with dignity and respect
Chesterfield,unacceptable waiting times,3/9/2021,2,on a regular basis having to wait 40-45 min to book an appointment is not expectable and then having to queue 30min plus to pick up your prescription.
Chesterfield,Very friendly,9/25/2018,5,The staff are so keen to help. They are very friendly and efficient
Chesterfield,Very good,12/16/2020,5,Always friendly helpful
Chesterfield,Very good,2/19/2019,5,"I find it very good here. I have been here about four years and this is much, much better than the practice that I transferred from. I am hoping to move home but if I am still living here when the move to Took's takes place I will most certainly move with the practice."
Chesterfield,Very good,9/13/2022,4,I find the surgery very good when I need it (not often). I can book advanced appointments
Chesterfield,Very good surgey,5/28/2016,5,this is a very good all round surgery
Chesterfield,Very happy,3/17/2016,5,I am very happy with the service and the way they look after me.
Chesterfield,Very happy,5/8/2015,5,Very happy
Chesterfield,very happy with all aspects,2/19/2019,5,"I have been registered with the practice for over 50 years!! I am very happy with all aspects. When I was poorly and couldn't get in to the pharmacy someone brought my medication to my house!!! I can always get an appointment, which is reassuring. I will certainly move to Took's with the Practice."
Chesterfield,"Very outstanding g.p.,s practice",2/27/2020,5,Faultless service
Chesterfield,Very pleased with the service,11/2/2019,4,"The proposed new site (Tooks) is a bit closer to where I live so I will happy to move with the practice when it goes. I am very happy with the service here, I have been a patient for about four years and I am very pleased with the service."
Chesterfield,Very Poor,8/26/2021,1,"Shockingly poor telephone service with waits of up to an hour just to get through. Very difficult to see an actual GP, usually a telephoned appt with a nurse. If you are lucky enough to get to visit the surgery and are told you need blood tests etc you can't make them there whilst you are at the surgery, you have to ring in again!"
Chesterfield,"Very, very good.",3/17/2016,5,I am very happy with the practice. they are friendly and helpful and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
Chesterfield,Wait a month,7/19/2016,3,If you want to see a specific doctor you can wait a month.  The advice about how to deal with my specific symptons is not good
Chesterfield,Wasnt listened to. Lost prescription,1/25/2019,3,Lost my repeat presciption requested on monday. Now sitting in reception on friday afternoon whilst this is sorted. Been waiting 40 mins. Recently had a consultation where i feel I was ignored not listened to and pushed out the door after 5 mins.
Chesterfield,We are looked after very well,11/2/2019,5,As long as I am still driving (when the new site opens) we will go there. If they are building from scratch I wonder if it might be possible to have a waiting area for parents with young children which is slightly away from the main area to localise noise etc. We are looked after very well here.
Chesterfield,Well-being chemist within surgery,10/12/2020,1,"Awful - long wait times, staff don’t acknowledge you are waiting to be served and ignore you, prescriptions don’t come through from the surgery, they then don’t have the items. The list goes on. Worst pharmacy in Ipswich."
Chesterfield,Will always squeeze you in,12/13/2017,5,"Very good with appointments, will always squeeze you in, they're very good with the children and signpost very well too."
Chesterfield,Works well,11/2/2019,4,I drive and I will move with the practice when it relocates. I would say that 90% of the times I come here (either for myself or one of my children) I am late going in. On the positive side I can see the same clinicians each time other than an emergency appointment and this is really important to me as my small daughter has an ongoing condition and they have an idea of the clinical history without me having to go into all the details every time. It works well for me.
Combs,Awful treatment,6/2/2021,1,"Made to queue up outside. No shelter or chairs. Hard to see a doctor and you now see a nurse practitioner. I am also hard of hearing and lip rid, so can't hear what they say. Going to the vets is far better treatment."
Combs,Difficult to get on the day or advanced,6/12/2018,1,"Very difficult to get appointments with any doctor for both on the day or advanced appointments. It's taken a long while to get an appointment with my doctor and continuity is very important to me so this has been frustrating. There is a need for more staff to cope with the level of need. The doctor I see has been very good, has taken time to get to know me and build a relationship."
Combs,Drs don’t seem to know much,5/14/2021,1,"Having spent several years in pain but always being told it was constipation or some other random problem. I presented every single symptom of ovarian cysts. Despite several visits culminating in my having an emergency operation on New Year’s Eve, my dr missed it completely.

I had an emergency hysterectomy due to the cysts being roughly 20 cm in size, there being numerous cysts, and one had twisted around my ovaries. Following surgery, no follow up checks have been made. I suffer agoraphobia, the Dr asked me why are you not going out? Then went on to blame the fact I have my daughters ashes downstairs and that, to them, meant I wasn’t helping myself. 

My daughter died from suicide 2019. I have been asked, despite being in a wheelchair and stressing how bad my agoraphobia is, a Covid injection, at some test centre an hour away from my home. So I can’t have it done."
Combs,Failure of communication before & during,3/8/2021,1,"[Day1] I requested further info about booking a Hep. B vaccine via the 'Ask My GP' service. Selected 'call back' option for the next day as I was working on the day the enquiry was sent. Despite this information, I was then called on [Day1] but because I was working I missed the call. Following voicemail on [Day1] I knew to expect a call first thing on [Day2]. [Day2] I was called by another person who then booked me in for the first stage of Hep. B vaccinations on [Day8]. This surprised me because only asked for further information about the process. [Day3] I had a message to say that my 'Ask My GP' request had been resolved and closed - this is something I had seen in a previous enquiry so dismissed the message as standard procedure after opening the service and seeing the the enquiry had definitely been closed. 

[Day8] turned up for my appointment, all signing in machines were out of order and no receptionists were at the desk and also didn't appear, even though I could hear them in the side of the room, when I rang the bell provided to let reception know patients had arrived. After standing around in reception another patient turned up and got sent through to the waiting room by a woman passing-by (staff). The same woman then noticed me and in a rude manner asked why I was there to which I replied that I had a vaccination booked for roughly five minutes time. The woman then abruptly asked who I was before vaguely gesturing for me to sit down in the waiting room. I then sat in that waiting room with no acknowledgment of if I'd even been signed in for at least 10 minutes before being called through to room 1A. 

As soon as I was in room 1A, without any introductions, it was demanded that I 'explain why I was there'. When I explained the above process of the 'ask my GP' enquiries etc. I was asked why I hadn't responded to ""the messages"". When I said that I hadn't received any messages and I asked what the messages were I did not get given an answer. 

After essentially being told off for even being there I was told that I needed a risk assessment form signed by my employer and that the surgery still needed to order the vaccinations. I explained I was happy to do this but the staff member in room 1A was too focused on how much of an inconvenience it was that I was even at the appointment. To try move away from the behaviour presented I tried to find a way to prevent the surgery being unable to get in contact in the future by providing my work contact number which was then written on a post-it note, so there isn't even a guarantee that will be added to my record. After still not being told what messages were sent, I ended up being told to leave after the risk assessment form, that I asked to take with me so the same problem wouldn't happen again, was unable to be printed or emailed to me. 

I am writing this complaint because there was absolutely no reason for the way I was treated. The rudeness and dismissive behaviour of staff and the inquisition that started as soon as I entered the treatment room was unnecessary. After the appointment ended, I checked my 'Ask My GP' portal and saw on [Day3] that the same person who sent a message about the issues of paperwork and practice procedure also resolved the message and therefore removed the active status within the same minute as sending it out. It was the final message of the enquiry being resolved that I had seen before the appointment. 

By reading between the lines of what was being said by the staff member in room 1A, I've gathered that I shouldn't have been booked before completing the risk assessment form. This is something I understand and I would have been happy to have cancelled the appointment to a time when the appropriate paperwork had been completed and the vaccinations had even been ordered. I am completely unimpressed with the way this situation was handled as, after the appointment, I've seen the messages and I had no texts or voicemails to indicate that the surgery tried to get in contact to change my appointment. In future just send text messages to call the practice instead of calling and leaving no message and relying on a system that clearly isn't always reliable."
Combs,GP doesn't listen,7/14/2015,1,I don't feel that my GP listens to me about my concerns and nor do they seem to be able to make a decision about the diagnosis. The receptionists always ask lots of questions about why I want to see the doctor and I don't find this is right.
Combs,I don't like the triage system,10/17/2016,1,Reception act as a barrier to getting an appointment.  By having to see a nurse first it can mean it takes longer to get seen and treated.  Mixed treatment explanation.  I like the patient calling system which lets you know when it's your turn
Combs,Impossible to get an appointment,6/7/2018,1,"I’m in a lot of pain and it’s proving so hard to get an appointment. It seems they have changed the way you book appointments and can no longer pre book, you have to call back the day, not ideal for someone who works!"
Combs,Inconsistent care,3/30/2017,1,No consistency of care leads to issues being missed.  Locums just look at previous notes and don't look at symptoms they are seeing so they carry on with the last doctor's treatment
Combs,It doesn't work,2/9/2021,1,"I couldn't get the appointment I wanted, a blood test with a nurse that I was advised to last week by a doctor"
Combs,No longer able to see your own doctor,5/8/2015,1,Not able to see your own doctors because of severe shortage of doctors. Good doctors are left doing what they can but it seems you have to go round the houses before you can get an appointment.
Combs,Not enough notice for flu jab,12/14/2020,1,I've been checking website every couple of days for over 50's flu vaccine dates but have found nothing. Last checked around 10th Dec. Looked today 14th Dec to find flu jabs were yesterday 13th Dec in the morning. This is not enough notice. Very stressful
Combs,Poor,7/3/2017,1,The GP asked the receptionist to tell me that I could not have a specific antibiotic on my repeat prescription as I've had for years but this was all done by phone and I've not had any proper discussion with a doctor about the situation
Combs,Rude staff & bad experience,6/16/2015,1,"My son had an appointment at 9am. We arrived at the surgery at 8.55am I tried to book him in on the machine but said it was unable and I needed to speak to somebody. I joined the queue of 4 people and waited 10 minutes to 9.05am. I tried to get the attention of staff but they were too ""busy"" drinking tea or photocopying. When I finally managed to speak to someone, they told me I was too late 9:08am to see the doctor, I explained I had been waiting in the queue for nearly 15 minutes they were very rude and told me I should have arrived at the surgery early. I told the person that I would not be leaving the surgery until my son has been seen as it was not my fault. The staff were very rude, snotty and unhelpful!"
Combs,Staff are always lovely,10/17/2016,1,"When trying to book a blood test you're not told how quickly you need it done so when you're asked by reception the only answer is ""I don't know""

The staff are always lovely when dealing with them.  The confusion caused by not getting enough information from a doctor make things more stressful than it needs to be"
Combs,unable to get an appointment,7/8/2015,1,My partner was unwell at work with chest pain and with a family history of heart problems he went to his doctor but he was turned away as there was no one available to see.  All the appointments were gone. He went home and only when another family member insisted he have an appointment did he actually get one.
Combs,unhelpful staff,4/9/2015,1,I had injured my shoulder and was wearing a sling but when I asked the surgery for asistance to refit it they acted like I was being difficult. In the end I went to the pharmacy at ASDA and they did it quickly for me and were far more helpful
Combs,Waiting 6 weeks for a blood test,6/30/2015,1,I have been waiting 6 weeks for a blood test. I was meant to have the test in May originally. I haven't seen my doctor for 2 years now.
Combs,Went elsewhere in the end,3/23/2016,1,A lady was triaged 4-5 times and all times sent home undiagnosed. After 14 weeks she got to see the doctor and was diagnosed with pneumonia and a swollen oesophagus and bronchitis. She went private and underwent a triple therapy to recover as she had enough of being ill and not being treated right.
Combs,Annual check letter not arrived,8/16/2018,2,I'm concerned that since the last check up for my diabetes that I haven't received my annual check invitation letter or the one for retinal screening.
Combs,Appointments difficult to get,6/12/2018,2,"Getting an appointment is practically impossible, I didn't get one yesterday but called this morning and got one to see the nurse today. Nurses and doctors give good explanations when you do get to see them."
Combs,Appointments difficult to get,8/23/2018,2,"I feel that being directed to other members of the team for advice and treatment doesn't always work, as they can't help and you end up having another appointment anyway. Its difficult to get appointments on the day even for the children."
Combs,Cannot get face to face appointment,6/26/2023,2,"I just cannot get a face to face appointment with a GP, I keep getting bounced around other people."
Combs,Can't see doctor of choice,5/9/2018,2,Don't like that you can't see the doctor of your choice and often have to see a nurse or the emergency care practitioner instead.
Combs,Difficult to get through on phone,3/28/2019,2,Very busy and even getting through on the phone is extremely difficult. Throughout the day the phone isn't answered. This morning took nearly 40 minutes to get through but I did get a doctor's appointment. To wait three days for an appointment when you're not well isn't great and I wasn't offered a GP+ appointment or call back . Staff can be a little sharp or unfriendly once they've said there are no appointments available and they just finish the call.
Combs,Disappointed,12/18/2020,2,"Failure to sign, scan and send through a death certificate 5 days after my mum passed- requiring registrar, funeral director and myself to chase - appalling."
Combs,Gatekeeping a problem by receptionists,10/27/2017,2,Hypothyroidism is not being treated effectively.  Gatekeeping by receptionists can be a problem.
Combs,Had to go to Ipswich for a blood test,2/25/2016,2,"Can't believe I couldn't walk the 5 minutes to this Dr's and have a blood test done, but drive to the other side of Ipswich to have it done. Was told that a lot of Dr's surgeries won't do blood tests locally and that two phlebotomists are leaving. What about people who don't drive or have access to a car ? It took me a 2 1/2 hour round trip to get the blood test done, if I had to get the bus it would have been a day trip !"
Combs,Inability to get a doctor's appointment,6/26/2018,2,"Tried to get a routine 6 monthly appointment with my GP 8 week wait.
Husband undergoing treatment can not get an appointment without taking day off work - no weekend appointments available - 6 week wait for any Doctor appointment at times / days impossible to achieve for working people.
Appointment for Practitioner to reduce waiting times but just doubles the need for time off work to be referred to GP"
Combs,Lack of doctors,10/17/2016,2,"The lack of doctors has impacted on the care I've received.  Each doctor has had a different approach, so to get to the bottom of the problem has taken 9 months."
Combs,Long wait for blood test,1/23/2023,2,I've had to wait 6 weeks for a blood test only to then receive a call to say the blood had been lost and I needed to have another test which I had to wait another 6 weeks for.  I've also found that the mental health support lacking but thats wider than just the surgery.
Combs,Poor,9/30/2019,2,A few admin issues at the moment.  To get a repeat prescription has been very difficult and needed multiple visits and phone calls which was totally unnecessary.
Combs,Poor,9/30/2019,2,My son has an ongoing condition and the receptionists refused initially to give him an appointment.  When I did see the doctor they said if I ever have problems again to let them know.  Receptionists can be quite rude when trying to book an appointment.  Generally the care provided by drs. and nurses is good.  the GP we saw was great + my son was referred to hospital
Combs,poor,9/30/2019,2,Just cannot get an appointment unless I can predict when I am ill!  Impossible
Combs,Poor and getting appointments is hard,10/16/2017,2,"Getting appointments is more difficult and you tend to be offered a nurse practitoner. .
Call waiting -  Is there a charge when on hold? Was 20th in the queue and on hold for 25 minutes"
Combs,"Poor. Getting appointments is hard, staff rude, doctors contradictory but nurses great",12/20/2016,2,Getting appointments is very difficult and continuity is a problem.  Doctors also contradict each other with advice.  At times staff can be a bit rude when I say I'd prefer not to say why I need an appointment.  I have a really good relationship with the nurses and they have been great.
Combs,Receptionists think they’re Drs,10/11/2020,2,"Receptionists decide whether or not you speak to or see a Dr. 
They make you explain yourself to them and then decide whether or not they think you deserve an appointment. 
Terrible surgery, unsympathetic, no empathy and no idea!"
Combs,Slow response,1/23/2023,2,I had blood tests for something quite serious but West Suffolk hospital had not received the results so the consultant couldn't diagnose formally and start treatment. I've asked the surgery four months in a row now if they could send the results they have on to my consultant but it still hasn't happened. I've now come to the surgery taken a copy of the results and posted it to them myself. For something so simple I can't see why it couldn't be done when I first asked.
Combs,Unhelpfullness of staff,7/7/2015,2,"Ringing up in the morning couldnt book an appoinment, rang up an hour later spoke to a different receptionist and was able to book an appoinment."
Combs,Abrupt reception staff,8/17/2016,3,Sometimes the way in which reception staff are with you can be a little abrupt. Getting appointments for the children is never a problem.
Combs,Always have to wait,10/23/2015,3,each time you have an appointment you will have to wait anywhere between 5 + 30 minutes
Combs,Appointment booking is a struggle,6/4/2018,3,"I don't feel that you can get an appointment very easily. Theres not so much TLC as there used to be. Once you get to see a doctor, the information and care is good."
Combs,Appointment difficulties,4/29/2015,3,Getting an appointment at the surgery can be a problem unless I stress that I am a carer and I'm concerned about my wife. If I say this I'm then offered an appointment the same day rather than having to ring back the next day to hopefully get one then. The care we receive from the doctors though has been good.
Combs,Appointments tough to get but GP+ is good,10/12/2017,3,"Difficult to book appointments by phone but the care provided has been good, and they have referred to GP+ when unable to give an appointment."
Combs,Attitude has improved,8/24/2019,3,It is often a long wait to get a non urgent appointment between 1-2 weeks. The staff attitude has improved over the last two years. Can be waiting for a while before I am seen.
Combs,Can be difficult to see a GP,5/25/2017,3,It can be difficult to get an appointment with a GP.  More often than not you end up seeing someone else like a nurse
Combs,Can take a week for an appt.,7/24/2017,3,My wife gets seen quickly as she has an ongoing condition but if I phone for an appointment it can take a week to be seen.
Combs,Caring but difficult to get appointments,10/12/2017,3,The doctors are really good but difficult to see them even with a young baby. They take their time with you and are caring.
Combs,Communication difficult,12/23/2021,3,"Following a stay in hospital I've found the communication very difficult  and almost non existent at times. The way in which I was told that I was being referred was bluntly delivered. Getting blood tests has been absolutely fine and they do it very well. I've used Ask My GP and one of the questions asks who you would like to come back to you but I've never been called by the person I say, feels like you're just a number!"
Combs,Communication is key an GP+ is well used,10/12/2017,3,"Local service, getting an appointment with a specific GP is very difficult. Reception are good at offering GP+ appointments when they are unable to see you at the surgery.Getting through on the phone can be difficult although it was quick this morning. I like knowing where in the queue I am. It would be good to be kept informed of delays or appointments are running late."
Combs,Consultant & GP opinions differ,10/12/2017,3,Being able to get convenient appointments to fit around work. Most of the GPs are very good however there are differences of opinion between the Consultants I see and the GP. The Consultant has said I should have a specific medication but the GP has said I should have something else instead. The nurses and healthcare assistants are very good.
Combs,Continuity of care is a problem,10/20/2016,3,"A lot of the very experienced GPs have left and many locums are not as experienced.  Continuity of care is a problem as seeing a different doctor each time means that information is not always taken into consideration as history can be complex.  It would be nice if continuity could be maintained, if they could find a way for it not to impact on the patient.  The system has worked well for me and the reception staff are competent."
Combs,Continuity with a doctor would be nice,6/12/2018,3,"It can be so hard to get to see a doctor or a nurse. In one instance it was a five week wait to see the person required. Today I got through on the phone first time, normally it is a bit of a wait, however, it is better than the system previously in place. Reception staff are always pleasant and helpful, I know who my GP is but I never get to see them, it would be nice to have that continuity."
Combs,Did not do well with mental health support,5/12/2019,3,"They did not do well in supporting or referring my teenage son to mental health support in my opinion, in the end we had to find our own support from Suffolk MIND."
Combs,Difficult if work full-time,3/28/2019,3,Working full-time it's difficult to get appointments.i wasn't offered a GP+ when an appointment yesterday wasn't available. Although I was given an appointment with the physio today. It's a shame more isn't available out of working hours so people who work can access appointments more easily.
Combs,Difficult to get appointments,3/28/2019,3,"I was quite lucky as I got an appointment with a doctor today, there have been times when I've seen a different member of staff who didn't get the treatment right. Getting appointments is difficult and this is the biggest problem at the moment."
Combs,Difficult to get appointments,8/23/2018,3,Getting appointments including blood tests is very difficult and to be told to go to Ipswich hospital is not always feasible. Receptionists generally do help but at times not so much. With a complicated medical history it is important to have continuity with the doctor you see but this isn't available at the surgery.
Combs,Difficult to get appointments,6/7/2016,3,"This morning I went in to the surgery at 8.15 and there were no appointments available, but there was only one person in the waiting room."
Combs,Difficult to get blood tests,8/22/2018,3,Very difficult to get regular blood tests especially when results are needed for other services. The initial response from reception can be a little defensive and almost makes you fell like you're not allowed to have the appointment being offered.
Combs,Difficult to see doctor,3/28/2019,3,"Very difficult to get a doctor's appointment, you can always get one with the emergency care practitioner but that's not the same."
Combs,Difficult to see Dr of choice,3/14/2019,3,"The most difficult bit is getting to see the doctor of your choice. There are times when you are asked to call back the next day, occasionally you are offered a call back by the doctor which works well. Getting a pre-booked appointment for a med review has been fine and staff are polite, caring and the majority of the time everything is explained well. It's the capacity of the surgery to keep up with the number of patients is the issue."
Combs,disappointed with initial treatment,2/24/2016,3,I saw a practice nurse for a chest problem but was told that I was wasting their time. I left the appointment very upset so asked reception if I could see a doctor to discuss what had happened. I saw a doctor immediately and he diagnosed bronchitis and gave me antibiotics. Up until now the surgery has been great.
Combs,Don't like not be told what blood results are,6/7/2016,3,I don't like being told that I will only be contacted regarding blood tests if something is wrong. Previously I found out at a later date that I needed medication following a blood test so I don't trust that I will always be called if there is a problem. If you do call for the results and want the actual readings it's as if you are being awkward but it's the only way to be sure.
Combs,Expected to go online,3/10/2022,3,"Everytime I've tried to get an appointment I've been told to go online, but when I've said I don't have easy access to it I've been told thats the system and you need to. There is a presumption that just because you're younger you use online systems. I'm never sure what to say on the forms and find it difficult. I would prefer a face to face appointment as nothing seems to be helping and doctors don't seem that interested."
Combs,Explanations can be limited,10/19/2015,3,Sometimes I feel that not enough detail or explanation is discussed in appointments and I get home and think of more questions. The turnover of GPs has been a little difficult and continuity has not been good. To get a blood test is sometimes difficult. Following an operation I had to go up to West Suffolk Hospital to be tested.
Combs,Fair,6/21/2016,3,A couple of weeks ago I called in the morning needing an appointment for my daughter.  I got told to hurry up and make a decision as other people were trying to get through.I was only trying to work out on the calender whether I could make the time or not. I asked if I could have ther person's name but she said no and told me to hurry up again.  Normally I'd rate the surgery a 5 but on that experience it was a 3
Combs,Fair,6/21/2016,3,"Had an appointment with a nurse practitioner after asking to see a doctor.  Was advised to take painkillers.  No better after a few days, so rang again.  No GP appointments again. When I visited I was offered an appointment in Felixstowe which was no good as I couldn't drive.  I refused this offer and sat and waited for a GP to see me, which they did.
I don't like having to tell the receptionists what the reason for my appointment is;  it can cause barriers and prevent me coming in as early..
Definitely not as good as it used to be.  I want to see a doctor when something is wrong, not a nurse each time."
Combs,Fair,3/30/2017,3,"Most appointments are made after my appointment. Nurse explains things well to me.
Having a bit more time in appointments would help, especially when when dressings need to be done"
Combs,fair,10/10/2016,3,I had a diabetic check and when I spoke to reception about the results I was told I was ok.  Later I was called and asked to come into the surgery.  When I spoke to the nurse I was told I was diabetic.  I've also had problems with my medication when I was prescribed the wrong medication initially.  It was only when the pharmacist saw me that they checked with the surgery and they changed what was  being prescribed
Combs,fair,6/21/2016,3,It fells that if you don't tell the receptionist what the problem is they won't give you an appointment.  The doctors are all fine.  In an ideal world it would help to have medication delivered.  The dispensary doesn't always have the medication I need
Combs,fair,6/21/2016,3,Last time I visited I waited 40 mins for my appt.  It would be better if patients were kept more informed about delays
Combs,fair,6/21/2016,3,The nurse on an occasion saw me but didn't really do anything more. There was a very negative attitude towards us.  Once the scan was done it was as if they'd done their bit.  I'd prefer to see one doctor all the time to help with continuity but when booking appts you don't even get asked who your doctor is.  Receptionists will also ask why you need to see a doctor but if it's personal you don't always want to say.  I shouldn't be made to feel I have to say.
Combs,Fair,1/29/2016,3,Since losing some GPs the service provided is not quite so good as you can't see the same GP
Combs,Fair but getting appointments is difficult,10/16/2017,3,The doctor isn't available most of the time so getting appointments is very difficult.  Having complex health conditions makes it more important to have continuity of care and this is difficult to do.  The care provided when you do see someone is very good
Combs,Fair but hard seeing my own GP,3/30/2017,3,"Getting an appointment to see my own doctor at the surgery is difficult.  I have seen the nurse which I was happy with but this has been ongoing and I need to see a doctor and I 'd prefer it was my own GP
Having some prebookable appointments would be better especially if you work"
Combs,"Fair, getting appointments is good but need to explain why I want one",10/16/2017,3,"Can get appointments but you do have give quite detailed explanations of why you need the appointment.
Quite friendly"
Combs,Fair. Reception staff could be nicer.,10/16/2017,3,At times it can be great but it can feel like you're being pushed through.  More sympathetic and compassionate reception staff would be good
Combs,Find Ask My GP difficult,12/24/2021,3,"I feel that it is difficult to see someone at the moment. I've tried using Ask My GP but it wasn't easy for me and I felt I needed to be seen. No one asked for any photos or to see me so in the end I called 111, saw a doctor and was advised to go to A&E. I just feel a little fobbed off by the surgery."
Combs,General appointment on the day difficult,3/18/2019,3,Getting a general appointment on the day is difficult and thats when you're happy to see any of the staff. They are much better now at explaining things especially to the children. It almost appears that reception staff have their idea about the course of action before you even start speaking which is frustrating.
Combs,Getting an appointment is sometimes difficult,4/21/2016,3,Getting an appointment with any doctor is sometimes difficult. At my last appointment I was not even asked by the doctor to take a seat. I was seen standing for the whole appointment
Combs,Getting appointments for the children is never a problem,1/9/2016,3,Sometimes the way in which reception staff are with you can be a little abrupt.  Getting appointments for the children is never a problem.
Combs,"Good consultation, reception could improve",3/23/2018,3,"Registration was smooth, did have to wait a while to see the nurse but getting an appointment was ok as it wasn't urgent. Reception is a little unapproachable when they close the window, especially when dealing with you in between questions. They are so busy & the waiting area is cramped. Would be an improvement if they let you know the doctors are running late. The nurse was amazing, very reassuring and calming."
Combs,GP talks to my husband instead of me,5/12/2019,3,"I have to take my husband with me into the waiting room, and I feel annoyed inside myself when the GP talks to my husband instead of me."
Combs,GPs have range of plans to treating me,10/12/2017,3,I like that they look after me well. Can't always see the same doctor and this means that you have multiple treatment plans almost as each have their own ideas of how to treat me. Prescriptions are always accurate and ready when needed.
Combs,Had difficulties,12/23/2021,3,I've been very unwell and have managed to get an appointment. I don't particularly like having to do it all by phone really. I've also had difficulties getting a child seen and in the end decided to go to A&E.
Combs,I have waited over an hour,10/20/2016,3,"Staff can be very short with you especially when you are trying to get an ppointment.  They just want to get you off the phone.  Medical staff have all been ok and I'm happy with everyone I've seen.  In the past I've waited over an hour for my appointment but they don't tell you if there are long delays.  If you ask you are told that you are in the queue.  Once you are through the booking process the care is good.
Getting a blood test can take 3 weeks.  If you use online booking it works for non-urgent advanced bookings but if you try to get an appointment for the next day they would all be gone"
Combs,I would like to be able to book appointments in advance.,10/17/2016,3,Reception staff can be very rude and unhelpful and want to know a lot of detail before giving out appointments.  Having advanced appointments available would be much better.  I tried to book a blood test but was told that they had none available and I'd have to call the next day.  I wasn't offered/advised of Ipswich Hospital but went as I already knew about it.
Combs,Lack confidence,9/27/2022,3,I do miss having a face to face so easily and having multiple calls instead. I've mainly seen the nurse practitioner who has been great but when you do have an appointment with a GP I get the feeling they don't want to spend much time with you.  I have no rapport with my doctor any more so lack confidence when they say something. The difficulty is getting past reception. Recently I needed to have an ECG done over a week but when I called reception they were adamant that I didn't. I did get a call back later to arrange the test I had said I needed in the first place.  It shouldn't be that difficult to arrange things.
Combs,lack of continuity,10/20/2016,3,"If you want to see a particular doctor it's about a 2 week wait.  With ongoing issues if you have to see a locum each time you have to go over all of your history.  I do like having the continuity.  My doctor gives me time, listens and will refer me on if necessary"
Combs,Lack of GP's,10/20/2016,3,The lack of GPs does affect the service offered and care provided but this is a national issue.  Getting to see a GP can take 2 maybe 3 visits with other practitioners.  On the other hand getting appointments for another family member has been very flexible. It would be helpful to have more appointments available and greater flexibiity to get advanced appointments
Combs,Like being able to talk to a Dr on the phone,10/17/2016,3,"Being able to get a doctor to call you is good as it's not necessary to have appointments al the time.  Generally the service works well.  I don't visit often, but when I do it's all good."
Combs,Long wait for blood test,10/5/2018,3,My grand daughter has regular blood test but has to wait 3 weeks to have the test done at the surgery. She now goes up to the hospital to get it done quicker.
Combs,Long waits for appointments,10/23/2015,3,There can be long waits for appointments
Combs,Making improvements,8/24/2019,3,Can be on the phone over 15-20 mins just to get through. Making improvement on this.
Combs,Mixed experiences,8/13/2018,3,"Have had mixed experiences, the nurse practitioners have been very good as are some of the doctors. Have felt fobbed off by staff at times both medical and admin and don't always feel that they give you a full picture. Was once told a test could be done the next day when I knew from past experience it could be done the same day which when youre in pain makes a lot of difference."
Combs,Mixed. Receptionists not friendly,10/16/2017,3,A bit mixed.  Usually the reception staff aren't very friendly;  they're not happy and not approachable. When I booked yesterday the man I spoke to was great. The phones have quite a long waiting time but the queue system is an improvement.
Combs,More GP constancy needed,5/12/2019,3,"I don't get the consistency of seeing the same GP if that happened the service would be better, but I have to say on the whole its a good surgery."
Combs,Need more choice,7/10/2015,3,"I don't like not being able to see my doctor. When booking online you don't get an option to choose who you want to see, it's automatic."
Combs,No appointments on the day,3/28/2019,3,"Getting an appointment this week has been especially difficult, it took 10 mins to get through today and I got an appointment with a doctor. When calling previously this week there were no appointments at the surgery available that day and I had been ok no the phone for 25 mins which was a long time, I was offered GP+ appointment though. Staff have been good and the way in which they dealt with there being no appointments was at least sympathetic."
Combs,No appointments were available,10/17/2016,3,Sometimes when you call staff can be a little abrupt and they can ask unnecessary questions.  I'm happy with the emergency care practitoner and have seen him before.  I needed to see a GP but no appointments were available so I have had to wait overnight
Combs,Not as good as it used to be,11/2/2016,3,"Generally very the years the service has been very good, however, at my last visit a potentially catastrophic mistake was made and I was misdiagnosed. Luckily the national screening programme picked up the potential health issue correctly"
Combs,Not easy to get through,11/10/2022,3,The phones are busy and its not easy to get through to them. Getting appointments is also not easy and I have found staff to be rude at times.
Combs,Not enough doctors,3/23/2016,3,"Maybe not enough doctors registered here, 3 I think, makes it hard to get appointments sometimes."
Combs,Not listened to,1/23/2023,3,I do feel that I have been raising concerns for a long time now about how unwell I've felt and all the different problems I've had but it wasn't until I was rushed to hospital  that I got the issues looked in to. All my medication was changed and I'm finally doing much better. I did see a doctor here after I was discharged and was told they would talk to the hospital to confirm the changes but they never came back to me.
Combs,Nurses good but hard to see specific GP,3/30/2017,3,To see a specific doctor can take 3 weeks but the nurses are good
Combs,One poor experience,12/23/2021,3,"I would've said everything was great before my last experience but when I tried to get an appointment I was told I had to have a covid test before being offered anything, they wouldn't even give me a call back on the phone.  I've tried using Ask My GP but it's taken time to get confident with it.  There is no signage to tell you that blood test patients can now wait in the waiting room, so waited in the cold."
Combs,Please update flu jab info,3/12/2020,3,No updated information on the flu vaccine for over 50's. Please update the website.
Combs,Receptionists should take the patients views,7/16/2015,3,Receptionists should take the patients views more seriously
Combs,Rude reception staff,1/17/2022,3,"I have a mental health condition and the reception staff do not tolerate anything and once I heard them be rude to me down the phone when they thought they had put me on hold. On numerous occasions I’ve tried to make appointments, I waited over an hour to be seen, multiple times be told to come back if my condition worsened (it has been so bad for the last 2 years already) I had to demand to be referred to a gynaecologist. You literally have to be half dead to get an appointment at combs Ford surgery."
Combs,Seeing a GP is tricky,6/4/2018,3,"Getting appointments is difficult, I haven't seen a GP for ages as I'm given appointments with another practitioner. I feel that this does negatively impact on the care I receive. My blood pressure is monitored by a nurse and I've never seen a GP for it. I would prefer to see my own doctor."
Combs,Seeing my own doctor is hard,6/4/2018,3,Its good but not as good as it used to be. I appreciate things have changed but I don't see my own doctor anymore.
Combs,Sometimes hard to get appointment,8/17/2016,3,You sometimes have to fight to get an appointment. In the past they have been really good fitting us in at the end of surgery in an emergency. They do usually get you seen on the day
Combs,Sometimes have to fight to get an appointment,1/9/2016,3,"You sometimes have to fight to get an appointment,  In the past they have been really good fitting us in at the end of surgery in an emergency.  They do usually get you seen on the day"
Combs,staff attitude variable,7/24/2015,3,"Sometimes it comes across that either the staff don't want to be there or they don't want you to be there.  At times they can be a bit blunt on the phone. When waiting for appointments the surgery do not always let you know how far behind they are running.  When they do use the screen to inform patients it's much better.

I am concerned that the receptionists are deciding which medical professional you see for your appointment.  It is my understanding  that other health professionals have been recruited but rather than the patient or doctor making the decision who to see the receptionists are deciding.

I had an appointment recently. I had booked to see my own doctor.  When I booked in using the electronic system everything was fine and when I asked the receptionist how far behind they were running for my doctor she said.  But when I went in to the appointment it was a different doctor and I hadn't been advised of this.

I was given antibiotics and paid the prescription.  The next day the doctor called to say I was on the wrong antibiotic so had to pay for a new prescription. for people on a limited income this is expensive."
Combs,Staff give differing explanations,3/18/2019,3,You can't see a doctor easily at all. I've had three appointments with the nurses but never felt it was quite enough. The docotr in the end aked to see me and I've been referred on to a private consultant. The issue started last autunm and I was told I had three diffierent things by each of the nurses I saw. Online prescriptions work well for me but the surgical stockings have been delayed recently.  I don't feel that reception staff should be making the decisions about who you get to see and it appears that you can only see a nurse when you call. When you do call to talk to someone specific they always have to call you back but they will never say when which is difficult.
Combs,Takes time to get appointment,6/12/2018,3,"To get any appointment takes time, especially getting through on the phone. I've been asked to call back the next day which did result in an appointment. I don't particularly like being asked why I need the appointment which in some cases is asked a bit abruptly. Since they started care navigation it does seem to have got a bit more difficult to get an appointment. Most doctors are good, you don't get to see your own GP though and with some locums it can feel you are being rushed out."
Combs,they are overstretched,6/27/2017,3,Difficult to get an appointment at times.  They do their best but they are overstretched.
Combs,Unhelpful and rude receptionist,11/23/2021,3,"Unfortunately, some of the reception staff let the surgery down by the harsh unhelpful response over the phone"
Combs,Uninterested GP,10/19/2015,3,"At a recent visit to our GP we felt that the GP was distinctly disinterested and showed no sympathy. The nursing staff have been absolutely brilliant and are generally interested in the problem even though they are on a tight schedule.

The dispensary staff are very good and I've had no problems with my prescriptions. 
With the pressure they are under I am happy if my appointments run slightly behind."
Combs,Waiting times etc,10/23/2015,3,"I visited the surgery the other week asked the receptionist for a sample bottle.  When I was given it I was given the tray and slip which I didn't need so politely told the lady this but she just said"" you should have said that in the first place.""  I found this rude and abrupt.
Waiting times can be terrible. Staff have seen me waiting to talk to them but they carry on and ignore that you are waiting. With the nurses generally they run to time but GPs tend not to +you never see them on time. It feels that you have to tell reception the exact nature for your visit even when it is personal and you are pushed for an answer + have to justify yourself if you do not to say.  Sometimes the screen in the waiting room shows how many minutes they are running behind but this is not always used.  Could it be?"
Combs,Would prefer to see my GP,7/11/2018,3,It can take 10 plus minutes to get through on the phone. I would prefer to see my own GP but rarely visit and I'm happy to see the nurse today. The parking does need monitoring.
Combs,4 star,7/10/2015,4,"I don't particularly like having to tell the receptionists what is wrong with me. If I ask to see the doctor it's because I need to see a doctor, not a nurse."
Combs,A generally good surgery,10/20/2016,4,"You can normally get to see a doctor on the day you call but maybe not with your prefered doctor.  This doesn't overly affect care but does mean you have to spend time going over your history especially with ongoing issues.  Nurses are good, easy to talk to.  It's generally a good surgery and meets my needs"
Combs,Access difficult but care good,6/1/2022,4,"I find access difficult due to the emphasis on using the online system. I don't go online so the only way I can access an appointment is to get a family member to do the form for me which I don't think is right. I shouldn't have to rely on my sister to do it there should be an alternative for people who don't go online. It's also a disempowering system and it's not always appropriate for me to ask my sister to do it, there are some issues I do not want to discuss with her. Even though I do not like the system in place the care provided by the staff is very good."
Combs,Advance booking is a challenge,6/4/2018,4,Getting appointments to see your own doctor is very difficult and you can't pre book. Its not an emergency so it feels wrong to take an 'on the day' for something routine. Doctors are lovely and care is good but you do need to be able to book in advance. Booking online for blood test works well but you can't book all appointments this way.
Combs,All pretty good,12/23/2021,4,"I've used econsult to arrange an appointment after treatment I'd been given before didn't work. It's all been pretty good, they are always on the end of the phone for you if you need them. I've been given very clear explanations by staff especially when blood clinics had to move location due covid."
Combs,All works well,10/20/2016,4,Generally see whoever is available.  More often see the nurses which works well
Combs,Always a delay,10/20/2016,4,Always a delay up to 30 minutes late; never known it to run on time.  It would be better to have an audio announcement saying which patient is next
Combs,Appointments are not a problem,6/4/2018,4,I can easily phone up and make appointments. Generally don't see my own doctor but this isn't an issue for me. Nothing needs changing.
Combs,Appointments system could be better,7/24/2017,4,"Getting an advance booking/appointment could be better as currently this is difficult.
Once you get to see a doctor they are very good but the appointments system doesn't work well."
Combs,Approachable and friendly,6/12/2018,4,"With the limited contact I've had with the surgery they have been very good. I registered here a while back and it all went very smoothly and was handled well. I've been happy with staff, they have been approachable and friendly. I haven't had any problems."
Combs,Ask My GP works well,12/24/2021,4,It generally works well for getting appointments. Using Ask My GP works and avoids the busy phone lines in the morning. The doctors responds with in the time frame stated and I've mainly had phone consultations which have worked well. The staff are also good.
Combs,Ask why appointment is needed,10/19/2015,4,When booking an appointment with a doctor it is almost like the staff can decide if I should have an appointment. I have a serious health condition but feel that the staff keep pushing until you give the reason for your visit.
Combs,Asthma clinic is very good but simpler repeat prescribing system required,12/20/2016,4,"The asthma clinic has been very good.  As standard, my son's medication is prescribed monthly;  if there was a simpler process for submitting the repeat request it would help"
Combs,Better phone system,8/16/2018,4,Can always get appointments for the children when they need them. The queue system on the phone is far better than having to call back.
Combs,Bit slow in waiting room,5/12/2019,4,"I have always found this surgery to be good and I am satisfied with the service, it can be a bit slow waiting to be called in to see the GP sometimes."
Combs,Booking appointments a challenge,6/4/2018,4,"Depending on the day it can be more or less difficult to get an appointment. I like everything at the surgery, staff are generally very good. Think its a good idea that reception ask what the appointment is for so that you see the most relevant person."
Combs,Booking appointments and timing are good,6/4/2018,4,You will always get to see someone when you need an appointment. Been happy to say why we need an appointment and the different practitioners have been good. Feel well cared for.
Combs,Booking can be problematic,10/20/2016,4,Sometimes you can ring and don't get much; other times they are really helpful.  You do need to prompt full explanations at times with lots of medical terminology.  Having an advanced booking system would be an advantage
Combs,Brilliant doctors,3/27/2019,4,"Doctors are brilliant, they are very good. Reception don't like to give appointments out and I visit the surgery first thing to book as I'm more assured of an appointment with someone at the surgery. There are times when there are no appointments available and I've only been offered a GP+ appointment once. My regular appointments are pre booked by the doctor which helps."
Combs,Brilliant Staff,8/1/2018,4,Very welcoming staff who all have time for you. Generally see the GP and nurses have been very supportive.
Combs,Call backs work well,6/12/2018,4,"You can't always get through on the phone straight away but staff are very friendly and helpful. If you're late calling it can be difficult to get an appointment but they do offer call backs and this has worked as after speaking to the doctor I've been given an appointment which was good. The only alternative was to call back the next morning, so it worked well."
Combs,Can always get an appointment,6/27/2017,4,"Can always get an appointment when needed especially with the children, even if it is late in the day"
Combs,Can be a bit of a wait,10/17/2016,4,Delays could be put on the board to advise patients so they know what is happening.  It can be a bit of a wait to see a specific doctor.  Seeing the same doctor at least means that they know your history.  No particular difficulties
Combs,Can be asked to call back next day,3/27/2019,4,You can't always see the doctor of choice but if you call early enough you will get an appointment. There have also been times when there have been no appointments available and I've been asked to call back the next day.
Combs,Can be difficult to get an appointment,10/19/2015,4,Getting an appointment can be difficult with on going health issues. To be told by receptionists that there are no appointments when I have to have one doesn't help. If I stand firm that I must have one I'm always fitted in. I do try to book in advance to prevent these problems. I'm happy to give basic details to receptionists but not always every details to get an appointment. The text message to confirm appointments are great.
Combs,Can be long waits,6/1/2022,4,"I have regular blood tests and find standing waiting to be seen difficult, it would be nice if a chair was available."
Combs,Can be long waits,10/19/2015,4,Getting an appointment can be problematic. Its generally quite good when booking to see a nurse but have had to wait 45 mins to see the doctor. A lot of the issues I have do require a GP. Sometimes you have to explain thoroughly what the issue is to get an appointment but even when I've only given a summary I've been given an appointment.
Combs,Can get appointments,8/13/2018,4,"Everything works quite well, you can get appointments when you need them. Some of the reception staff are not overly helpful and can be a bit abrupt at times. The rest works well."
Combs,Can see any doctor,8/16/2018,4,I like that you can see any doctor you like which helps to get appoiontment. If you ring early enough you will get an appointment. Even though the appoinmtment may run behind time this doesn't affect how long they will spend with you.
Combs,Cannot fault anything,3/30/2017,4,I can't fault anything.  Appointments are available when needed.  Happy with all the staff and referrals have been quick when needed too
Combs,Can't fault the surgery,6/7/2022,4,I really can't fault my surgery. The staff have been really good. I am worried about losing 2 more GPs.
Combs,Can't get diabetes test kits,7/11/2018,4,In the last year we've not been able to get the type two diabetes test kits like we've had before.  We now pay privately to monitor it more effectively. It seems a bit short sighted to stop people monitoring their sugar levels.
Combs,Care good - staff can be a barrier,12/20/2016,4,Reception staff aren't very accommodating and almost form a barrier but care has generally been good
Combs,Care has been good,8/16/2018,4,Normally never have delays getting an appointment with in 48 hours. It would be nice if patients had some involvement when they are allocated a doctor. Care has also been very good.
Combs,Care is good but getting appointments is hard,10/16/2017,4,Care is good.  Appointments are difficult to get.  Have to book blood test in advance to ensure they are done in time for hospital appointments
Combs,"Care is good, booking appointments are tough",8/1/2018,4,Difficult to get an appointment with a specific doctor and it can mean a 4 week wait. Care provided is good.
Combs,concern re decisions made by receptionist,7/24/2015,4,I am a little concerned that receptionists will be deciding if I see another health professional rather than a doctor. I would think that someone medically trained would make that decision.  Maybe the surgery could clarify the process.
Combs,Content with the surgery,6/4/2018,4,Very friendly and helpful staff. It can be frustrating trying to get through early in the morning when you are either trying to get to work or are already there. Parking is good.
Combs,Continuity with Dr is difficult,3/27/2019,4,Getting to see the same doctor is very difficult but everyone from reception through to the doctors is great.  Today I'm seeing the emergency care practitioner instead. Everyone is lovely at the surgery and all are helpful.
Combs,Delays,10/23/2015,4,It tends to take a long time to be seen especially in the afternoon sessions getting through on the phone to book appointments can also be difficult.. The senior nurse practitioner been great but in the past I have had had issues with being misdiagnosed by one of the other nurses.  At times I can find the questions a little intrusive.
Combs,Difficult to get an appointment,12/10/2015,4,Hard to get an appointment. I called last week to get an appointment to see the doctor but was told none were available and to call back on the day. I did but we can only see the nurse.
Combs,Difficult to get appt.etc,10/23/2015,4,V. difficult to get appt. esp. since my GP left.  I now see any of the doctors but have to explain everything even though it's on their computer each time I visit.  Booking an appt.using the automated telephone line is v.difficult as appts are all gone.  I called yesterday but no appts. were available so I was given one for today.  Luckily there was a 2nd appt. available for a test I needed as the the next appt. for the test would have been in November.  Getting thru at 8 am is difficult + often appts are gone quickly.  I don't like the idea that you have to tell non medically trained staff why you need an appt.  I feel pressurised into telling them what is wrong.  On one occasion when on the phone I could hear the member of staff shouting to colleagues to ask who dealt with the problem I had.  On another occasion the staff tried to give advice on the condition.
Combs,Difficult to get routine appointments,8/22/2018,4,For a routine appointment and it has taken 10 days to get an appointment and there has been a bit of a wait to be seen today.
Combs,Dispensary superb,8/13/2018,4,"Very busy surgery, difficult to get through on the phone at times. The TV screen is a little small and difficult to read.  The dispensary is superb, always have a smile and a laugh and are always very helpful and accomodating."
Combs,Doctor listens,6/12/2018,4,"When I can see the doctor I prefer they give time and listen.  I don't like seeing different doctors which does mean longer waits, up to two months, to see my doctor which was too long. Seeing someone different each time for appointments means you have to explain all over again"
Combs,"Doctors good, pharmacy not so good",10/23/2015,4,"You can wait up to 1hour past yr. appt. time before being seen.  I think my doctor is amazing + has been great. Getting an appointment can be difficult.
Twice now I've had to wait up to 20 mins to get the attention of the pharmacy staff.  It lets the surgery down especially when they look like they are inconveniencing them."
Combs,Don't get a named doctor,8/13/2018,4,"Can usually get an appointment on the day. You don't get a named doctor anymore, when you don't get a choice of who to see it means they don't know you and you have to explain everything each time. Its nicer to have a relationship with them rather than being hit and miss who you see.  You are unable to book advanced appointments unless the GP has requested to see you in a certain time.  It would be better if this was possible to help plan. I'm happy most of the time to explain why the appointment is needed but like that if it is personal you can say so and they don't enquire further."
Combs,Don't see same GP,7/23/2015,4,I'm on my third doctor in 6 months! It seems that receptionists have access to medical records which I was surprised about.
Combs,Drs very good,1/23/2023,4,"Doctors are very good as are reception, I've never had a bad experience. The response time on Ask My GP has been 2-3 days at times especially over Christmas and I do feel it just takes more of the doctors time doing it all. My long term condition is managed well and I find staff to be supportive and informative. On the whole its a good surgery."
Combs,Easy to get appointments,12/23/2021,4,It's been easy to get appointments and  staff are polite and explain things well. The waits on the phone aren't too long so it all works well.
Combs,Encourage you to see a nurse,7/11/2018,4,Not too bad to get an appointment but they do try to get you to see a practice nurse. Just feel that you don't always get to see a GP when needed. Getting through on the phone is better.
Combs,Everything is good,3/10/2022,4,"I don't often need appointments as just have ongoing issues so I pick up medication monthly, and have never had any issues getting them. Staff are helpful and friendly."
Combs,Excellent surgery,5/12/2019,4,"I have had a good hospital referral from here, this has been an excellent surgery, it is one of the best I have ever used. Can't think of anything that needs to be improved."
Combs,Explanation is fine,8/24/2019,4,Do not have to wait long to be seen. I find that staff on the phone are not very helpful but staff on front desk can be. Explanation is fine but treatment doesn't seem to resolve issue which is frustrating. Nurses are very good.
Combs,Fans still run in cold weather,11/2/2016,4,In the cold weather the fans still run and make it draughty and cold. The care and treatment by nurses and doctors is very good. getting an appointment can be a little difficult especially recently. May be they could inform patients if they are running late and by how long.
Combs,Fearful about lack of continuity,10/19/2015,4,"Because of the situation at the moment I am fearful that the lack of continuity will impact if I have a more complicated issue. I am very sympathetic about the situation and hope the surgery can get back to how it was, which was great. Sometimes I feel that if you see a nurse they have to keep going back to get the doctors agreement on things."
Combs,Friendly,12/23/2021,4,When I've needed an appointment I've been happy with how its all worked and how I've been treated. It's all good and staff are friendly.
Combs,Friendly,9/29/2016,4,"Friendly, very helpful and clean."
Combs,Friendly staff,6/12/2018,4,"You can phone on the day and get an appointment which is great. I've never had an issue with any of the staff, they are all very good, helpful and friendly. The sign in computer works well, its easy to use and saves on staff time."
Combs,Friendly staff,6/12/2018,4,I've had limited contact with the surgery but when I have had an appointment it has gone well and all staff have been friendly and explained things well.
Combs,Generally good care,1/29/2016,4,Generally good care but when I had an appointment with a GP and had just started to explain what was wrong a nurse came in and started talking about another patient.  After a number of minutes she left.  I discussed the main issue I had come to see the doctor about but when I tried to raise something that I thought could be related to my long term health condition I was told appointments were only 10 minutes long and there was no time.  Half of the time had been spent by the doctor & nurse discussing another patient!
Combs,"Generally ok, nurses very good",3/30/2017,4,"Generally ok and the nurses have been very good, especially with the children.  Getting to see a GP is more difficult and at times seeing the same person about my condition is helpful"
Combs,Getting appointments is unpredictable,6/4/2018,4,"Can be difficult to get an appointment at times but they've arranged different appointments for us today, close together."
Combs,Goes well,8/24/2019,4,"Can wait up to two weeks to get an appointment. I have regular INR blood test here, that goes well. I would prefer not to have to wait so long for a GP appointment. I am concerned that new houses are going up locally and I have no idea how they are going to be catered for with the doctors."
Combs,Good,1/23/2023,4,Overall the surgery is and has always been good. The booking in computer didn't wor this morning but reception were helpful and friendly.
Combs,Good,10/16/2017,4,Small and intimate feel at the surgery. Better now that the new phone system is in place: much nicer to know where in the queue you are
Combs,Good,10/16/2017,4,Quite good.  We're fortunate here; other surgeries not so good
Combs,Good,10/16/2017,4,"Even though I rarely see my GP but see the nurses, I don't feel the care provided has been negatively impacted when given"
Combs,Good,7/3/2019,4,Once you do see someone they are very good but at times appointments are difficult to get.  The nurses look after me well. At times I do feel a little rushed but on the whole I'm happy.
Combs,Good,7/3/2019,4,Attending for a health check.  Very rarely visit the surgery but got an appointment today ok.
Combs,Good,7/3/2019,4,Would like to have the ability to make advance appointments for non-urgent issues. The ability to get on the day appointments has improved.  On the last two occasions I've got an appointment the same day
Combs,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Sometimes difficult to get an appointment.  Last week I couldn't get one here so was given an appointment with GP+ that evening.  The GP recommended I had an appointment with my own GP but when I tried to book with reception they said I needed to go back to see the OOH GP, which can't be right. 6 2017"
Combs,Good,3/30/2017,4,If you're flexible you will always get an appointment.  Care is good and it's generally a good surgery
Combs,Good,12/20/2016,4,Had something in his eye.  Wasn't able to be seen by the GP so came back a couple of days later for it to be looked at
Combs,Good,12/20/2016,4,"From a service user's perspective, great to have the press buttons to help when using a wheel chair.  Doctors come out to the home if needed"
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,On the whole staff are very good.  On occasions receptionists can be very protective of their doctors I've been very pleased with the car I've received.  I've never had problems getting appointments
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,It would be great to be kept informed if doctors are running late.  Being able to book ahead of time or on the day is great.  Sometimes you can get quite rude receptionists and this isn't necessarily just when booking appts.  This has improved recently
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,"When phoning for appointments you can just be told there are none but this response has improved over the last 3 months  .In the past all I've  been told is to phone 111 & be advised by them.  It would be good to have the children's toys and books back. When the doctors are treating my daughter they do talk to her and not to me, which is good."
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,It seems near enough impossible to see my own doctor.  Seeing them means they know your history and it makes the whole situation more comfortable.  Appointments do run late;  it can get very frustrating when it increases to up to 3/4 hour.  the availability of blood clinics would benefit fro afternoon sessions as well
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,Generally it's a good surgery.  It would be great to have a few kids toys/books back to help entertain them while waiting
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,Staff are friendly and kind and try to do their best for you.  So having more late or early appts would help esp. for people doing shift work.  Waiting times are normally quite good.  Treatment explanation is very non-judgemental.  They do their best
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,I was on the phone for 15 mins this morning trying to get through.  It's not with my own doctor but I did get an appt.  Waiting times can be quite long
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,Called 111 this morning and they sent out an ambulance.  Once there they said that rather going to hospital it would be better to see my GP first thing.  When I tried to get an ppt. we had to fight to be seen early as they offered a l ate afternoon apt. initially
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,Getting appts is not a problem; phoning through can be difficult first thing  but I've never had a problem getting a appt. when I need one.  I have waited 1/2 hour for my appt.  Sometimes they will say when a doctor is running late but this isn't always for all doctors.
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,There has been a bit of a deterioration over the last 6 months as you are unable to see the same doctor each time; waiting times are generally quite good though
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,A couple of months ago it was particularly difficult to get an apt with a doctor and I haven't seen my own doctor for roughly a year.  It is a local surgery with a dispensary which is great.  It would be great to have more GPs but understand this is difficult
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,Sometimes it is difficult to get apt but on other occasions you ring with an emergency and you get seen quickly
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,"Sometimes staff are a little off-putting and almost try to stop you making an appt.  There is a drive to get you to see a nurse and I've then had to see the doctor anyway, wasting my time and the nurses.  The surgery is very friendly and we've been here a long time"
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,It can be very busy so there can be delays but this is understandable.  Sometimes getting to the solution takes time.  It's good that you can always get an appt. when you need one.
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,Today running a bit late but generally the waits aren't too long
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,I needed a blood test but had to wait just under 4 weeks to have the test done at the surgery.  I was never told that I could have had the test done much quicker at the hospital
Combs,good,7/3/2019,4,so I have now asked for a MRI and am waiting for an appointment.
Combs,Good,1/29/2016,4,Since the changes and loss of GPs it has become more difficult to see our own GP.  Because of underlying health issues it is easier to see my own GP but this is often not possible.  I'd prefer more continuity
Combs,Good,1/29/2016,4,You can always get an appointment when you need.  There has been an ongoing issue with a child which has needed 3 visits but so far we have not been able to see a doctor about the issue
Combs,Good,1/29/2016,4,Communicating to patients when there are delays would make it much better.  If they used the tv screen more regularly it would be better
Combs,Good,1/29/2016,4,Working full time it can be difficult to get an early or late appointment.  Previously I was able to have blood tests done at 7.30 am but this has been stopped and I now have to go to hospital regularly which is much more disruptive when working.
Combs,Good,11/27/2015,4,"I have diabetes and have been very well supported by my nurse for several years.  She even on her day off accompanied me to a hospital appointment,  I was then told that I could no longer see her and had to see another nurse.  I later found out that I could've seen her all along.  I have been very happy with the nurse but due to my complicated history I do find that they can't always answer the questions I have.  Maybe they could train them furtherso they could be more helpful"
Combs,Good,9/10/2015,4,The care I've received has been good but I am very concerned by the recent loss of 2 GP's. Instead of a doctor you are expected to see a nurse.
Combs,Good and accommodating with appointments,3/20/2017,4,"Generally a good surgery and quite accommodating when arranging appointments. .  Having confidence in your doctor is important and seeing a different doctor makes this more difficult,."
Combs,Good and can book appointments fine,10/16/2017,4,Can phone and book in advance when necessary. Generally a good surgery
Combs,Good and can get appointments,10/16/2017,4,Generally can get appointments when needed; maybe a couple of days.  Technical health explanations can be difficult as English is not my first language
Combs,Good and can usually get appointments,3/30/2017,4,Meets my needs and can generally get an appointment.  I called yesterday and was told no appointments were available and to call back the next day
Combs,Good but difficult getting appointments,3/20/2017,4,Calling first thing for appointments is difficult.  Happy with the doctors and like having a local service
Combs,Good but early appointments hard to get though fit in children and school times,12/20/2016,4,Trying to get an appointment first thing is an issue but they are very good at trying to get the children around school
Combs,Good but getting appointments is hard,10/16/2017,4,"Getting an appointment with a GP is particularly difficult, especially a specific GP, but seeing a nurse is easier.  Care is good: it's just getting in to see the right person.  Often you see someone who can't help and the need to book another appointment.  The nurse practitioner is excellent"
Combs,Good but getting appointments to see own GP is hard,10/16/2017,4,To see a specific GP is more difficult and getting continuity is important.  Even though you are told any GP can see your notes it's more rare that they've been read.  Care is good as are explanations.  Being able to see a GP of your choice can take 3 weeks though
Combs,Good but hard to get appointments,3/20/2017,4,"Struggle to get appointments at the surgery although care is generally good.,  GP 5*  Really like the GP+ service at Bury which I'v used a couple of times.  It really helps to fit appointments in around work"
Combs,Good but hard to get appointments first thing,3/20/2017,4,Local service.  Generally good but because I work shifts the requirement to call and book appointments first thing is difficult
Combs,Good but lack of GP's,10/16/2017,4,There is a lack of GP's at the surgery and you see the nurses first;  sometimes it can work but on other occasions concerns were dismissed and not addressed.  When you see the right person it does go smoothly
Combs,Good but sometimes hard to get appointments,3/20/2017,4,"Most of the time everything works.  There are occasions when getting appointments is difficult and it would be nice to see the same GP, not locums all the time.  Would be helpful if the room and doctor name stayed up longer"
Combs,Good but staff attitude hit & miss,3/20/2017,4,"Location is important.  Staff attitude on reception can be a little hit and miss when trying to arrange appointments.  At times there is a lot of pressure to disclose what is wrong over the phone,  Care is good and I like my doctor a lot"
Combs,Good care,3/20/2017,4,It's local for me and care is good.  Try to see a nurse before seeing a GP to save GP times
Combs,Good care but mix up with my records and rude staff,12/20/2016,4,"The care that I've received is good.  However I was called in to discuss my recent scan but when I spoke with the doctor I was told I'd had a scan that I hadn't had.  When I queried it, it turned out that the results were another patients which had been put on my file.  When I called for other results I was told by reception that I was unable to have them as no one was available to let me know them.  She was very rude and when I said I neede them today I was given a phone appointment with a doctor.  The doctor called me within minutes.  Why didn't the receptionist offer this in the first place?  I've lost all confidence in the practice"
Combs,Good except for communication,1/29/2016,4,There seems to be a lack of communication between the hospital and the surgery.  I received a letter from the pain management dept of Ipswich hospital yesterday after chasing the surgery for about a month.  When it arrived it was dated November 2015.  It should not have taken 2 months to reach me.
Combs,Good GP but online appointments are limited,12/20/2016,4,Really like my GP but online the appointments for them are a bit limited.  More time slots would help.
Combs,Good information provided,6/12/2018,4,A brilliant surgery can always get an appointment but the only issue is that you don't get to see your own GP. Staff provide good information at all times and it generally works well.
Combs,Good service & I get an appointment when I need one,12/20/2016,4,The service meets my needs 9 times out of 10.  I can get an appointment when I need one.  A few months ago I couldn't get an appointment and was told to call back the following morning
Combs,Good service despite being under pressure,12/20/2016,4,It's difficult for the surgery to offer an excellent service when they have little control over things.  The nurses give good explanations and maintain a good level of care.  Nurses take pride in their job.  I do feel a bit rushed with my appointment
Combs,Good service from emergency practitioner,4/2/2016,4,I recently saw the emergency practitioner and was happy with the treatment and care. He referred me to hospital and I was seen in three weeks. Sometimes there are waits to see the doctor or nurse but this is perfectly understandable if other people need a longer appointment.
Combs,Good support with child,8/22/2018,4,"Getting an appointment on the day can be difficult. I do generally take the children to see the nurse rather than a doctor and try to go to the pharmacy before coming to the surgery as it's much quicker. Have had very good support with my child from the nursing and GP staff, they have been fantastic. It would be great to have other services based at the surgery."
Combs,"Good, no problem getting appointments",3/30/2017,4,Queue system worked well.  Liked knowing where was in the queue.  No problem getting appointments and generally the surgery meets my needs.
Combs,Good.,12/5/2016,4,Quick and easy to book and helpful support from GP.
Combs,Good. Can get appointments easily and waiting times not bad,3/20/2017,4,Can get an appointment quite easily and waiting times aren't too bad..  Generally works as a surgery for me
Combs,Good. Don't like receptionists asking why I needed an appointment,10/16/2017,4,"They always try their hardest to do what they can to get you in.
Don't particularly like being asked by receptionist why I need an appointment"
Combs,Good. Staff very good and can also get appointment,3/20/2017,4,"Whenever the children need an appointment they will always get one.  The emergency practitioner is brilliant.  The chilidren will  ask to see him and he has a great way with them.  The nurses are very good with them as well.It's not a rotating door here, they take time to listen and talk to you about concerns"
Combs,GP brilliant,2/9/2015,4,I think my GP is absolutely brilliant. Other stuff can be a little difficult at time and need to be as polite as patients should be with them.
Combs,Great trainee GP,12/23/2021,4,Not finding there are any issues but I do prefer to talk to someone on the phone rather than use Ask My GP. I've had face to face appointments and there was a great trainee GP who explained things well but seems to have left.
Combs,Happy,1/23/2023,4,I'm a very light user of the surgery and although Ask My GP works well it has taken a little while to get used to it but it has worked to get appointments. The telephone consultations I've had have also addressed the issues each time.
Combs,happy with care but would like to see my doctor of choice more,12/20/2016,4,It would be more ideal if I could see the doctor of my choice but I've been happy with thecare provided and staff are all good
Combs,Happy with GP but staff can be rude and getting appointments can be hard,12/20/2016,4,Reception staff have been quite insistent that I tell them why I need an appointment but some things are private.  They have been quite rude at times at well.  I've been happy with my GP generally;  it's just getting an appointment that can be difficult
Combs,Happy with service & getting appointments,12/20/2016,4,Quite happy with the surgery at the moment.  At the moment we have ongoing appointments and have no trouble getting them when we need them
Combs,Happy with service and staff but some long waits at surgery,12/20/2016,4,Sometimes the waits can be a little long but today is the longest I've waited.  Explanations can vary depending on who you see but this hasn't impacted on the care I've received.  The staff are very friendly and I'm happy with the service
Combs,Happy wtih service but appointments sometimes hard to get,12/20/2016,4,Quite happy with the service that I'm getting but getting an appointment cand be ifficult at times
Combs,Hard to get a specific test & would like to see my own GP more often,12/20/2016,4,difficult to get INR test.  have been told by nurses they can always squeeze them in but reception just say there are no appointments available and I need to go to Ipswich hospital which is very difficult.  I'd also like to see my own GP more often as I have an onging issue rather than seeing different doctors each time
Combs,Have a good relationship with GP,7/11/2018,4,"Really like my GP, they have a good understanding and I have a good relationship with them. I try to see the same doctor for continuity with my condition. Getting appointments urgently is more difficult and there have been times when I've not been able to get one on the day. Generally its good and you can book appointments in advance."
Combs,Have to wait 6-8 weeks.,8/24/2019,4,if I want a specific GP I have to wait 6-8 weeks. Other than that I am happy with this surgery.
Combs,Helpful staff,8/16/2018,4,"A local service, easy to access and nice and simple to get in. Helpful staff who will fit you in. It does help if you see the same doctor as they know your history."
Combs,I would like to be able to book ahead of time.,10/20/2016,4,The front desk and pharmacy staff are all polite.  It would be better to have the ability to book ahead of time for non-urgent appointments.
Combs,Improved. Receptionists friendly. Surgery needs a refresh,10/16/2017,4,It has improved. They listened to me and referred me on for additional care which all went smoothly.  Reception are friendly. The waiting room needs freshening up. They have introduced new ideas which have been great such as the COPD pack.
Combs,Information board is negative,10/19/2015,4,The information board in the surgery (TV) was quite negative as it focused on when and how long you should wait before coming to the surgery to see someone. Some of the times suggested seemed a little excessive.
Combs,Insufficiently interested in us as patient,10/23/2015,4,Sometimes when with practitioners they spend more time typing rather than talking or looking at us as a patient.  Even though I have been allocated to a doctor I don't get to see her much.
Combs,Lack of continuity,10/23/2015,4,When my doctor left I was not allocated a new doctor which means I do not have continuity especially as the hospital needs a named contact.  I don't like having to tell the receptionist why I need an appointment.
Combs,Language can be a barrier,6/4/2018,4,"When I call for an appointment, I can generally get one. Doctors are nice but I do struggle to be understood as my first language is not English."
Combs,Like to see own GP,6/1/2022,4,Generally I like to see my own GP as I feel that they know me and the care I receive is then better but I understand that it's not always possible and the care received is always good. I've used Ask My GP but don't find it an easy system as I don't go online much. It has meant that I had to  get my daughter to do the submission but she shouldn't have to so I now tell reception that I do not go online which is great and they are fine with it too. The only issues I've had are when my notes aren't read by the clinician and that led to issues when my medication was changed.
Combs,Marvelous staff,12/23/2021,4,Haven't had any problems getting through to the surgery or getting appointments. The doctor has been very supportive and caring and the staff generally are marvelous.
Combs,Medical staff listen well,5/12/2019,4,"I am always able to get an appointment for my son on the day. I often get referred to the nurse practitioner when I ask for to see the GP which can be frustrating, but they do listen well."
Combs,Miss the continuity,8/1/2018,4,Miss the continuity and feel that it can mean issues are not understood or addressed fully. Not too bad to get appointments and the only issue is around seeing the same doctor.
Combs,Mixed experiences,3/10/2022,4,"I've had to ask if I'm eligible for a shingles jab, which I am, but I've used Ask My GP and it worked well and was simple to use and got a quick reply, it's better than calling the surgery.  

I've just seen an excellent member of staff for a vaccination. Really thorough. I mentioned an issue and she checked me over well, very pleased.  I do find it strange that there is no back up when the IT system goes down, I was turned away last week when it went down and no records could be accessed."
Combs,More difficult to see a specific doctor,6/12/2018,4,"When you call in the morning it can take time to get through on the phone and to then get an appointment, especially if you want to see a specific doctor.  Its a good surgery generally but it has changed over the years."
Combs,Never had appointment on time,7/14/2015,4,I've never had an appointment on time I normally have to wait at least 20-40 mins. Sometimes the receptionists can be a little intrusive. The midwives at the surgery were great when I had my children.
Combs,never have problems getting appointmentds,6/27/2017,4,Come for regular blood tests and don't have problems getting appointments
Combs,"Nice staff, alternating appointments is good",8/1/2018,4,Friendly and approachable staff It can be difficult to get an appointment but I've been given a nurses appointment instead.
Combs,No issues,12/24/2021,4,"It's our first appointment at the surgery and we've had no issues getting it, very pleased."
Combs,Normally have to wait,10/23/2015,4,You normally have to wait past your appointments time to see a GP.
Combs,Not listened to brilliantly,1/23/2023,4,Haven't had a great experience as I don't feel that I've been listened to and issues haven't been acted upon as I would've liked. Individual care from doctors though has been very good and they call late in to the evening which is very good of them.  The whole process has been long and drawn out. I've also been discharged from the hospital after 2 years of investigation but no diagnosis. It's all be a bit difficult.
Combs,Notes not always updated,9/23/2021,4,"You are encouraged to use Ask My GP but I would prefer to talk to someone but generally the process of getting an appointment is working considering covid. It wasn't overly clear whether I should be going in the building for my blood test this morning as it didn't say anything on the door. I've also found that my records haven't been updated when I've informed staff of changes, I shouldn't need to keep telling staff the same thing each time I have an appointment. I am eligible for a flu vaccination but have been told there are only sessions on Saturdays and I can't make them which mean I can't have one at the surgery even though they encourage you to go to them so they get paid."
Combs,Nurses very good,12/24/2021,4,The nurses have been very good treating and dressing my legs regularly. I have my appointments weekly and they are rebooked after each appointment which is great and really simple.
Combs,ok,4/9/2015,4,Waiting to see the phlebotomist was very long at Combs Ford surgery. Overall though they took blood well but didn't engage with me brilliantly.
Combs,"OK but staff could be more welcoming, communications improved and more books for children",12/20/2016,4,To have a smile on arrival would be better.  Quite happy with the waiting times.  Generally et the explanation I need but sometimes it's difficult to understand what is being said.  Additional books books for the children would make it easier
Combs,On the whole great,10/19/2015,4,"On the whole the care I've received has been great, although the recent issues are causing some concern."
Combs,Overall care very good,12/10/2015,4,Continuity of care with midwives has not been great but the overall care has been very good.
Combs,Phone message is very long,12/24/2021,4,"No issues getting an appointment, it's been great. The staff are lovely and Ask My GP has worked really well too as it's not easy to get through on the phone and the message is very long. It does sometimes feel like there is a threat that if you don't tell reception what is wrong with you you won't get an appointment."
Combs,Phone system is better,6/12/2018,4,"The phone queue system is an improvement. It can be very difficult to see my own GP, up to a months wait. They are very busy but the nurses are great and I don't mind seeing them at all. The TV screen in the waiting area is very small and therefore it is difficult to read or see the content and the information disappears very quickly, not allowing enough time to read it .  Reception staff are very good, they are helpful and make sure that you see the right person."
Combs,Phoning at 8am doesn't mean an appointment,11/2/2016,4,Phoning at 8 am doesn't mean you will get an appointment that day. Quite often you can't get an appointment as they are gone. Sometime the staff can be a little off with you when booking. Overall the care and treatment by doctors and nurses is very good.
Combs,Phoning can be a challenge fine with appts,3/23/2018,4,Sometimes difficult to get through on the phone but generally you can get appointments when you need them.
Combs,Pleasant staff,8/13/2018,4,"Generally pleasant staff, feel comfortable and staff do what they need to. Phone system works well and its a nice friendly practice where they'll always fit you in. Its quick to get appointments straight away."
Combs,Polite staff,3/27/2019,4,Staff are polite. Repeat prescriptions are automated which works well. Staff are mindful and patient with me on the phone. Text messages work well to remind me if appointments and I'm happy to see whoever is available to see on the day.
Combs,Prefer continuity with doctor,6/12/2018,4,"I do prefer continuity with the doctor I see so it can be a bit more of a wait to get an appointment. Its important to me because it makes discussing ongoing issues easier rather than telling someone new everything. The appointment system is good, I've had a lot of appointments recently and always get an appointment. I do tend to book the next one before we go home though."
Combs,Prescriptions need sorting regularly,8/1/2018,4,Its okay and the care meets my needs. Have had an issue with how a situation was handled but this has been resolved. Mistakes on prescriptions are common and their regular delays which isn't great when they are weekly prescriptions.
Combs,Pressure to use online services,12/24/2021,4,I don't use online systems and don't have an email address but I was told by reception when I asked for an appointment I needed to do it online and set up an account. Initially it was suggested that I ask someone younger to set it up for me before they then agreed to give me an appointment for my husband who needed to be seen. It shouldn't have been so difficult or been dependent on going online as not everyone can.  Not seeing someone face to face does mean that issues are put off but when we've really needed an appointment we have got one and the staff are quite good generally.
Combs,Process not always clear,9/23/2021,4,It's difficult to know how you get to see your GP now and it would be better if Ask my GP was easier to and more obvious to use.
Combs,Quick response,1/23/2023,4,I've not needed to use the surgery much but the responses on Ask My GP are quick and I find it easier than calling the surgery. The staff are good and I generally see the same doctor  who I do really like. I feel that my long term condition is monitored well and the staff are approachable if I ever have any questions. I also like the text message reminders as they really aer helpful.
Combs,Quite quick for appointments,8/13/2018,4,"You can get an appointment quite quickly and I've never had any problems. Staff are all nice, it would be better if you were able to pre book appointments and children are normally see straight away."
Combs,Rated very highly,5/12/2019,4,"I cannot fault it here, I do rate it very highly."
Combs,Reception are helpful,9/23/2021,4,The phlebotomist is really nice and helpful as are most of the reception staff and it makes all the difference. I've had call backs with in about 2 hours but I would prefer that I could see my GP face to face as some issues need to be seen.
Combs,Reception go the extra mile,7/11/2018,4,The reception staff have gone the extra mile to really help get us an appointment. Communication with staff has been great and we've felt very cared for. Although you don't see your named GP the care and support received has not been unduly impacted.
Combs,Reception helpful and accommodating,3/27/2019,4,"Receptionists are very good, they have really improved, very helpful and accommodating. You can see a doctor but getting to see a specific doctor is very difficult. I've called three morning's this week to try and see a certain doctor but I'm now seeing a practice nurse instead today. I would like to see magazines in the surgery to give you something to read while you wait. I do find medical staff excellent at explaining things."
Combs,Reception staff can be sharp,8/24/2019,4,I have had good referral to hospital. The reception staff can be a bit sharp with their attitude at times. Otherwise the surgery is fine.
Combs,Satisfied with the service,9/23/2021,4,It is easy enough to book an appointment and be seen the same day if it's needed. Blood tests are also easy to arrange and staff are efficient and friendly.
Combs,See doctors when needed,8/13/2018,4,"I can get to see a doctor when I need one, which is better than my last practice. Generally works well for me and staff are friendly too."
Combs,Seeing own GP takes time but worthwhile,10/12/2017,4,"Nice local surgery, you may not get to see your own doctor but you will get an appointment when needed. I prefer to see my own GP for continuity but this can mean waiting 3 weeks for an appointment"
Combs,Service is second to none although hard to see preferred GP,12/20/2016,4,"The actual service when you can get it is second to none.  It is very difficult to get to see my named GP.  I tried recently and was told there were no appointments available 3 weeks ahead.  
To maintain continuity is important when there are ongoing issues"
Combs,Should always be a face to face option,6/1/2022,4,I understand the surgery is very busy and its been a very difficult situation for them. I've used Ask My Gp which has worked well for certain problems but there should always be the option to have a face to face with a doctor. I asked to talk to someone in person about my mental health but it was declined by the doctor and I had to chat on the phone which I found really difficult.
Combs,Slight delay with appointment but care good,10/19/2015,4,My appointment today was 15 mins late but the care provided has been good.
Combs,Smoking cessation help,4/2/2016,4,"I received a text from the surgery asking if I would like to give up smoking. I went to get an appointment but they was unsure if they still offered the service.  They found out they did and said I would be called back. This took two weeks, although i now have an appointment for Monday.  I feel that in the time it took to get a reply I've lost some of the impetus I had."
Combs,Some staff can be abrupt. Brilliant doctors medical staff.,12/20/2016,4,A couple of staff are a little abrupt on the phone.  The doctors here have been absolutely brilliant as has the Emergency Care Practitione and the nursing assistant.  It's much better than it previous was.  Sometimes it gets a little warm in the waiting room.
Combs,Sometimes wait up to 6 weeks,8/24/2019,4,"I have found it hard to get an appointment, sometimes having to wait up to 6 weeks. The only thing I would change is reduce waiting times for appointment."
Combs,Staff are Excellent,8/1/2018,4,Staff are always friendly and helpful. Always kind and caring with the children. Can find it difficult to see a doctor but the nurse practitioners are good.
Combs,Staff are friendly,7/11/2018,4,"The location is good, the staff are friendly and there is plenty of parking . The only difficulty is getting an appointment that fits with work. You end up having to take a whole day off work to see someone."
Combs,Staff are good,12/24/2021,4,"I tend to call reception to arrange an appointment and it works well with appointments are available when needed, the staff are also nice to talk to."
Combs,Staff are good,2/10/2018,4,"I do have trouble getting appointments at the surgery, its frustrating but once you're seen by the staff they are good."
Combs,Staff are great,12/24/2021,4,I use Ask My GP and this works well for getting appointments. The staff are great when you do see them and I feel that it generally works well at the moment.
Combs,Staff attitude not always great and hard to get an appointment.,12/20/2016,4,Staff attitude can vary a bit.  When trying to get an appointment it can be difficult and sometimes staff aren't always helpful
Combs,Staff fantastic,12/23/2021,4,"Its very cold in the building today with all the windows open, no heating and the fans going. I've used Ask My GP to get an appointment and it's worked well, I did struggle to get a bloods appointment though. Staff at the surgery are fantastic."
Combs,Staff good on the phone,12/24/2019,4,Staff are good on the phone I think face to face could be a little better. Can a clock that is working be put into the waiting area please.
Combs,Staff listen,8/22/2018,4,Its a very good surgery which is close to attend. All the staff are friendly and listen and they have great expertise. The dispensary staff are very good at sorting out any problems. Routine appointments can take some time to be able to get seen but for urgent issues you are seen.
Combs,Starting to settle down,3/10/2022,4,"It feels like it is starting to settle down. Phone calls back can take some time, they aren't the perfect option but work for most situations."
Combs,Telephone booking line is methodical,11/2/2016,4,Booking appointments in advance is sometimes tricky but I use the automated telephone booking line which is very methodical.
Combs,Tend to get appointments on the day,6/12/2018,4,"The treatment and care provided are both good. Its quite good to get appointments, when I've called I tend to get one on the day I need one. The nurses are also very good."
Combs,The care I've received has been good,7/10/2015,4,The care I've received has been good but I am very concerned by the recent loss of 2 GPs. Instead of a doctor you are expected to see a nurse.
Combs,The care I've received has been good,7/10/2015,4,The care I've received has been good but I am very concerned by the recent loss of 2 GPs. Instead of a doctor you are expected to see a nurse.
Combs,The staff have been great,10/20/2016,4,"The GPs I've seen have been very good but you don't get to see the same one.  The nurses have been great, treating my wife's leg over the summer.  The system works well and we have been lucky to get the care we need."
Combs,The waiting times can vary.,10/20/2016,4,A good surgery that meets my needs.  The waiting times can vary a bit
Combs,Three doctors in a year,11/2/2016,4,I do find it a little difficult to see a doctor at the surgery. I've had three doctors in a year and more regularly see a nurse than a doctor.
Combs,Ticks along nicely,3/27/2019,4,"The check in machine is difficult and often doesn't work. To see someone specific does take a long time but generally they do everything well, it ticks along nicely."
Combs,Treated well,8/16/2018,4,Always been treated very well by staff. Having the nurse practitioners is very good and on the whole it works very well considering the number of patients.
Combs,Triage Service,3/23/2016,4,"Good A&E and triage service.  Saves trips to hospital and waiting times, you can phone anytime for an appointment"
Combs,Unsure why I'm here,12/24/2021,4,I was called and asked to come in to the surgery but I'm not sure why I'm here. Care provided by the staff is normally is very good.
Combs,Up to 30 mins waiting for phone,5/12/2019,4,"Waiting for the phone to be answered in a queue can be up to 30 mins, maybe they can put another person on the desk to answer the phones at 8am. On the whole everything else is good at this surgery."
Combs,Very friendly,12/24/2021,4,Called yesterday and got an appointment for today. I've been happy with how doctors and nurses have explained things so it works well. The one way system in the surgery is clear and the staff are very friendly.
Combs,Very good,3/10/2022,4,"The dispensary staff have been great this morning as I wasn't able to get my medication from the pharmacy, but they have sorted it all out for me which was great. Everything is now more online and it probably isn't so easy to see the GP but generally its a good surgery."
Combs,Very good - Very amenable,10/13/2016,4,"Very amenable, they treat me very much as an individual. I get to see the doctor I want when I want and they are very obliging and will do a phone consultation when appropriate. The nurses I've had have been very good and so everything needed. 
The dispensary has also been very good and they've always made sure I get my medication ."
Combs,Very happy,5/12/2019,4,"I am happy overall with this surgery, no changes needed."
Combs,Very happy with the surgery,1/23/2023,4,I feel I'm getting on very well with the surgery. I can't use Ask My GP but reception staff are great and fill in the form when I'm on the phone and I get appropriate responses in a good time too.  I spoke to someone yesterday and was given an appointment for first thing this morning. The surgery has always been very good and I'm really happy with it.
Combs,Very nice staff,12/23/2021,4,We've not had any problems getting appointments and when you call it doesn't take long. The staff are very nice and great at explaining things but it is very cold waiting outside to have your blood test .
Combs,Very supportive nurse,6/12/2018,4,"Very good once you actually get an appointment. It can take time to get them and you are asked to call back the next day. they do well with what they have.The nurse I see has been very supportive during a difficult year, been wonderful."
Combs,Very thorough,7/11/2018,4,Nice local surgery where you get good treatment which is very thorough. Not being able to book an appointment ahead of time and only being able to book on the day means that you end up having to take more days off work.
Combs,Waiting times,10/23/2015,4,Sometimes I have to wait 15 - 20 mins. past my appointment time.
Combs,waiting times can vary,10/17/2016,4,Waiting times can vary a bit and are just dependent on the day.  I can get appointments when needed and don't feel anything needs to change
Combs,Where's the human touch,6/1/2022,4,"So much of the service now is remote or based online, where's the human touch? The doctor we saw today was very patient and I was really impressed with the way they were with us, she was the best we've ever seen."
Combs,Works well,1/23/2023,4,"Using Ask My GP works well and allows you to say when you are contactabe at work which is helpful as I can only take calls at lunchtime.  With the children its been a little mixed, one child has good continuity and the other not so much but not really sure why. Overall its a good surgery."
Combs,Works well,12/20/2016,4,Worked well.  This is only the second visit in about 5 years.  Got an appointment this morning..  Generally works well
Combs,Would be nice to see my own doctor,8/1/2018,4,It would be nice when you call if you could actually see your doctor and not have to wait at least 10 days. Doctor prescribed medication that I was allergic to as they hadn't had my notes.
Combs,You can only ring at 8am for appointments,5/12/2019,4,"It would be good to have the opportunity to be able to ring in the afternoon to make an appointment, with only being able to ring at 8 am and get in the very long queue this makes fir it to be very difficult to me."
Combs,You will get an appointment,11/2/2016,4,"You may need to persuade for an appointment but generally you will get one. The automated system does work well, however, you're unlikely to be able to get an appointment with your named GP. It can feel that there is more of a barrier than there needs to be. When trying to book blood tests we are often told that we could go to Ipswich for it to be done instead. Getting around locally for my mum is difficult, the extra time involved is too much just for a blood test."
Combs,"A friendly, welcoming surgery",10/20/2016,5,"A friendly, welcoming surgery.  To see a specific doctor takes about 2 weeks but this is ok.  Generally a good surgery"
Combs,A little more time with the doctor,7/16/2015,5,I would like a little more time to be spent discussing issues prior to having a prescription.
Combs,A very competent surgery,6/4/2018,5,"Its a convenient surgery, always helpful and always clean. I book by visiting the surgery. I then get the text reminder which is very helpful and helps me to remember when to go for my appointment. They provide good information when discussing issues."
Combs,Able to get appointments,6/27/2017,5,Able to get appointments when needed
Combs,Above and Beyond,5/12/2019,5,"I could not wish for a better surgery, they always fit me in with an appointment, the receptionist staff on the phone are always so friendly, they seem to go 'above and beyond' in trying to help."
Combs,Access is easy and fulfilling,6/4/2018,5,"Able to get an appointment easily yesterday. I needed to see a GP, and have, very pleased with it all. Very rarely visit the surgery so it all works fine when I do."
Combs,Advised to go to a&e,6/7/2016,5,I had a fall last week and still have a sore rib. I called the surgery today to see if I could speak to a nurse but was told to go to a&e. I have no transport and only wanted some advice.
Combs,All work well,7/11/2018,5,"Happy with being able to get appointments and they will try to help out where they can. No problems with the surgery at all, works well. I can't see anything that really needs changing other than quicker blood tests but I prefer to come here for tests and wait rather than have a go to Ipswich for it."
Combs,All working well,3/10/2022,5,"I find using Ask My GP better, and the replies only take a couple of hours so its a much better system. I haven't needed a face to face appointment as talking on the phone or Ask My GP has worked well."
Combs,Always been brilliant,1/18/2022,5,"Love ask my GP service, I knew what was wrong and dr was very helpful, gave me right medication but made me absolutely aware that if I needed to be seen I could be very quickly, very reassuring.  However I didn’t feel well enough to go out in the rain and cold. Hope this service stays!!"
Combs,Always get to see someone,11/2/2019,5,When I've called for an appointment I've always got to see someone. Generally I see the doctors but I'm happy to see nurses too. Generally it works very well for me and the information staff provide is good
Combs,Always great,12/2/2019,5,"A brilliant surgery, always been good to get appointments when they are needed, it's always been great"
Combs,Always happy with the response and service,11/29/2021,5,"Always get seen if needed, I use the ask my gp and get a response to queries and medication quickly."
Combs,Appreciate the staff,8/1/2018,5,Very responsive staff who listen to what the problem is do all they can to sort things out. Fairly well kept informed. It would be great to have more phone consultations for quick issues but generally can get appointments on the day if you call first thing.
Combs,Ask My GP is quicker,1/23/2023,5,I've found that Ask My GP is a quicker service to use. I have had a couple of cancelled appointments due to staff sickness lately but that can't be helped. I don't always really understand  what is being said when they try to explain issues but this surgery is much better than my last one.
Combs,Ask My GP works well,12/23/2021,5,"Never had any issues getting appointments and Ask My GP works really well. My husband has regular appointments and they've been wonderful, never a problem. Staff are very polite and helpful."
Combs,Asked to go to Ipswich instead of my surgery,11/2/2016,5,I have I&R blood tests and generally I have the blood tests at the surgery. One member of staff just told me that I would have to go to Ipswich for the tests when I live less than 1/2 mile from the surgery. On the whole they are good but one member of staff has told me twice to go to Ipswich for the tests.
Combs,Been excellent,8/13/2018,5,"Always been excellent, the staff over the years have been very good. Works well when you need them."
Combs,Blood test process works well,6/7/2016,5,"I have regular blood tests as I take warfarin. They monitor the readings well, I get a letter one to two days after my test to tell me if my medication needs amending and when I need to go back for the next test. The nurses advise to book the appointment as soon as I receive the letter as they are so busy.ive never had a problem getting an appointment as I always book in advance."
Combs,Blood tests available,9/23/2021,5,"I've had no problems getting appointments. My husband has had lots of blood tests recently and we can always get the appointments when they are needed. Staff at the surgery are also very good. The explanation about where to go and what to do for blood tests is a little unclear, weren't sure if we should be going in or not, it just said use the side door."
Combs,Booking appointments a challenge.,12/14/2017,5,Like that I get the continuity with doctors. Can be a little difficult at times to get appointments.
Combs,Brilliant. Dr was very good and helped me a l,3/29/2021,5,I was very ill and dr saw me and was great and she was brilliant  when I what'd information about COVID-19 vaccine jab.
Combs,brought my sister for ecg and blood tests,4/27/2018,5,"Very pleasant staff, very efficient aftercare, results and medication all sorted within hours - a real same day service - wish I was a patient at Combs Ford - my surgery is dreadful by comparison"
Combs,Can be long waits,12/2/2019,5,"Sometimes there can be long waits for appointments, but I've always been given one even if it is more in the future than I'd like."
Combs,Can get appointment when needed,6/27/2017,5,Can normally get an appointment when needed and the surgery is generally good
Combs,Can get appointments without hassle.,12/14/2017,5,"You can easily get an appointment not necessarily with your own doctor but they are all good. They are helpful & explain everything. No complaints, reception are very good."
Combs,Can have to wait for appointments,10/19/2015,5,Waiting times can be a bit long. Today I've had to wait 10 minutes.
Combs,Can wait a while for an appointment,4/14/2016,5,Sometimes I have to wait a little for an appointment. I do see different doctors but this is fine.
Combs,Can't find fault,11/2/2019,5,Generally appointments run to time and I can't find fault with the service provided. You can always get appointments when needed and in the past I was visiting regularly to have my legs dresses and never had an issue. I do find that people park at the surgery to use the co-op at times as there's no one at the surgery waiting but the carpark is full.
Combs,Can't plan ahead,3/18/2019,5,"You can't plan ahead to book an appointment, when I called today I did get an appointment but you do have to see whoever is available. Staff generally are helpful and online services work well."
Combs,Care provided has been very good.,10/17/2016,5,The care provided has been very good and the doctors have been great.  The only problem which is annoying is when trying to book a specific diabetic appointment.  I've tried to book but been told that I have to wait until my letter arrives; but when the letter arrives it says please book or if you have already done so .....  So why can't I book before the letter arrives when I know I need the appointment?
Combs,Cheerful Reception staff,10/16/2018,5,"I would like to thank the young lady on reception today, she was very helpful and polite"
Combs,Clean and tidy,8/13/2018,5,I've had limited contact with the surgery being a new patient but so far I've been pleased and it's very clean and tidy.
Combs,Completely happy with the nurses,11/2/2016,5,I generally see the nurses and I'm completely happy with the care they provide especially around my diabetes.
Combs,Comprehension could be better with staff,6/4/2018,5,Having a local service is important. Sometimes the way things are said when you are talking to the reception staff is not always good.
Combs,Confident in care provided,8/13/2018,5,Its an excellent surgery that will do home visits when needed. I'm confident in the care provided and you can get appointments when needed. Seeing the same doctor would be better as youy get the personal support but things have changed nationally. The emergency care practitionerhas been very good and the learning disability health checks are done annually and have helped to get a referral on to the hospital.
Combs,Continuity and appointments are great,6/4/2018,5,I've had two operations and they've always made sure test results are passed to me. Getting appointments has been ok especially as I no longer work. It's a good improvement to have the blood pressure monitor in the waiting area.
Combs,Couldn't have wished for better service,8/24/2019,5,My husband got ill and I couldn't have wished for better service - you have to ring at 8am to be seen on that day. You can book ahead if you want to.
Combs,Detailed & prompt action following home visit,6/17/2021,5,"Having contacted the surgery via the 'Ask my GP' process asking for a home visit appointment for my elderly mother after concerns about her health I was pleased that Health Care Practitioner (name removed) was able to visit my mum & carry out an examination of her. Mum mentioned that he had a caring & compassionate approach to her & explained things to her clearly. As I live over an hours drive away I was grateful for his call to me to explain the result of his visit, it was very reassuring."
Combs,Difficult to see your doctor,1/25/2017,5,Getting an appointment with your own doctor is particularly difficult. If you phone before 10 am you will get to see a doctor but not necessarily yours.
Combs,Dispensary very good,3/10/2022,5,The dispensary are very good and always so helpful. I feel that things have settled down now and I really can't fault the care provided. I'm happy to see any of the staff but do try to see the same GP if possible.
Combs,Doctor is brilliant,8/16/2018,5,"The service is good, the doctor who I see is brilliant. They diagnosed quickly and I was admitted to hospital. All the follow up care has been good and I've been monitored well. The nurses here are also good and I can't really fault the surgery."
Combs,Doctor is very good,11/2/2016,5,My doctor is very good. I didn't have problems getting an appointment today but I'm not particularly happy disclosing full information about the condition / reasons for the visit. In the past I've waited 40 minutes for an appointment.
Combs,Doctors and nurses are really good.,1/25/2017,5,"Doctors and nurses are really good but at times the receptionists can be a little harsh. They can be quite judgmental at times and not very understanding, the courtesy and politeness sign should work both ways. The fans in the surgery can make it quite chilly in the waiting room. Staff are helpful generally so this maks it a good surgery. Due to mum's condition she forgets things so I try to arrange appointments when I'm around but if there were a system that could remind her of her appointment nearer the time it would help."
Combs,Doctors and nurses very good,3/18/2019,5,"Can get appointments quite easily at the moment, doctors and nurses are very good, very supportive and helpful. Been very lucky, staff are accommodating and helpful."
Combs,Doctors listen and take things forward,11/2/2016,5,Compared to my previous surgery I feel the doctors listen and take things forward more quickly when issues arise. I see both the nurse and my doctor but may have to wait up to a week if I'd like to see my own GP.
Combs,Don't wait too long,8/22/2018,5,In general you don't have to wait too long to be seen. It can be a little difficult to get an appointment when you are reliant on someone bringing you to the surgery.
Combs,Drs are good,10/17/2016,5,Although I have a new doctor I haven't actually seen them yet.  The doctors I've seen though have been good.  I book my blood test appointments early to make sure I can get them on time
Combs,Drs will do house calls,8/18/2015,5,When needed my doctor will do house call and they are great
Combs,especially good with children,6/27/2017,5,You tend to get an appointment when needed; especially good with children
Combs,Ever so polite and helpful,7/11/2018,5,They do a really good job. I like that you can get an appointment when you need. Ever so polite and helpful. I think they do very well.
Combs,Everything is very organised,3/12/2018,5,They are brilliant-absolutely brilliant! Emergency practitioner (ex paramedic) is great. He represents an extra option. The doctors ring back if it urgent and they make an appointment for me if that is necessary. Everything is very organised
Combs,Excellent,12/24/2021,5,"I haven't used them for 2 years but came in yesterday afternoon and spoke to reception and the GP and they arranged for me to have a blood test this morning and a follow up appointment with the GP.  An excellent experience, very reassuring."
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"All excellent, I can get appointments easily enough and staff are always good, polite and helpful."
Combs,Excellent,10/16/2017,5,This is a lovely surgery.  All very nice.  Doctors are good.  Very impressed with how well and quickly the surgery managed to arrange a test at the surgery.  Parking is easy
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,The doctor was amazing.  After arranging tests quickly we were called by the hospital and went up straightaway.  I've seen the nurses who have been very good. Getting prescriptions is no problem either.
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,They do all they can to see you quickly and I'm happy to explain why I need to see someone.  We've been very lucky with our doctors; they are brilliant.
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Very happy.  Rarely use the doctors but when I do I can always get an appointment.  I didn't have an issue  getting the appointment.  The staff are always polite on the phone and car park is large enough, especially with next door."
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Always been responsive to my needs. My doctor goes above and beyond.  It is difficult to get an appointment;  however they will do all they can, even if a phone call is what they can offer"
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Really like the new phone system and knowing where you are in the queue.  At times receptionists can be a little sharp but this is on rare occasions.
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Never had any problems.  For blood tests I can go in early on occasions, just depending if there have been any problems.
Another family member has had problems getting appointments especially with a female doctor.  
Whenever I've been unwell I've had very good care"
Combs,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Sometimes feel that you are an annoyance when talking to reception.  The way things are asked is more of an issue rather than being asked.  Really like that you can be seen when needed, especially with the children"
Combs,Excellent,3/30/2017,5,considering the challenges the surgery has faced they do wonderfully
Combs,Excellent,3/20/2017,5,Happy with the service provided.  Doing the best they can with the resources they have
Combs,Excellent,12/20/2016,5,No problems.  I get my blood tests done every 3 weeks at the surgery and never have any problems getting appointments.  Everything is spot on.  Been treated very well
Combs,excellent,10/10/2016,5,A good surgery with helpful and caring staff
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,For my requirements the surgery works very well
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Waiting times can be up to 45 mins long.  If there are long waits they will keep you informed on the board
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Friendliness of staff makes it a good surgery.  There is good co-operation with hospital and any changes made by consultants are acted upon quickly.  Sometimes appts run a little behind. In the main getting an apt is not too bad but at times getting to see a GP is more difficult
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,A little bit hit and miss regarding waiting times but this isn't a problem as I'm given time in my apt to discuss things properly.  The whole practice is good.  No need for improvement
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I've been really pleased with the emergency care practitioner.  He has been great with my wife who has ongoing issues. He even arranged for a late appointmentso that she was seen without patients being arround
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Waiting time can be a little long, which for me isn't an issue but whenI'm reliant on other people to get me to and from appts. it is then. Friendly staff, good surgery"
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"On average you can wait for 1/2 hour but for a good service & to know the staff are giving people time this is not an issue.  I am very happy with the care I get at the surgery no complaints at all .I've had mixed messages about blood tests.  I received a call from reception saying everything was fine & then a call from the doctor a couple of weeks later saying there were issues.  this concerned me a little.  The GP I'm seeing at the moment is really good & I've been lucky to see her when I need to and I never felt rushed at all and I do feel heard,"
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Waits can be long but this is understandable and not problematic.  At times explanations are in depth enough;  this could be due to time limitation.  I have on occasions booked a double appt. which has worked really well.  Receptionists are all lovely.  I'd prefer to have the doctors face me when they are talking to me rather than typing on their computer
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Being updated by newsletter about the changes has been good
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"One one occasion I saw a locum but was made to feel I was wasting her time but on another time but on another time with a different locum the doctor I saw was great.  I don't feel that my appointments are rushed.  When seeing the nurses, who are great they spend time and fit me in when I need to see them.  I'm really happy how they've been with me.  Treating my ulcer has been a long process but they are doing a great job.  I'm having blood tests done here at the moment but I'm worried that this will change."
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Appointment are normally really good but today waits are long.  The service has improved recently.  You don't get to see the same doctor all the time however.  However I'm pleased with the care our family have had.
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,It's been a consistent surgery and even when they lost GPs it didn't impact on me.  I get to see the same doctor all the time.  Waits can be about 1/2 hour which is reasonable.  The nurses all know what they are doing & are helpful
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,When people try to book appts following their apt with a doctor it gets very congested on reception and a backlog happens because people are also trying to book in.  Staff have been very good very caring and helpful.  I get home visits regularly and these are not a problem to organize.  When seeing a locum he diagnoses very well but his explanation was lacking
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Local, with the children it's easy to see the nurse practioner which works really well.  Waiting times can vary and it's good that the delays are shown on the board"
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Very pleasant and good when you get to see the doctor.  There is nothing that needs improving although Saturday appts. would help.  At times waits can be 20 minutes long
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,very polite staff.  I don't have problems getting appts. and I'm seen when I need to be seen
Combs,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"It's a good surgery.  It's a shame that we don't have our own doctor any more like in the past, but things have changed.  On one occasion I waited 40 minutes for an appointment. Generally it's not that long but appts. are never on time"
Combs,Excellent,1/29/2016,5,I don't have any problems with the care provided.  We've needed a lot of home visits and this has never been a problem to organise.
Combs,Excellent,10/23/2015,5,I use the blood clinic regularly and I've had absolutely no problems.  Test results are prompt and I've never had to chase.
Combs,Excellent,10/23/2015,5,The care I got from nurses after my hip replacement was excellent
Combs,Excellent and attentive staff,12/20/2016,5,This morning I arrived and there was a little mixup whereby my appointment wasn't recorded.  Staff arranged for me to have an appointment half an hour later.  Reception staff have been absolutely wonderful.  Staff have been very attentive
Combs,Excellent and can get appointments when needed,10/16/2017,5,Can normally get appointments when needed and the surgery generally works well
Combs,Excellent and friendly staff,10/16/2017,5,Don't find anything wrong with the surgery.  I don't come very often.  Called last week for a non urgent appointment.  Reception staff were very helpful when speaking to them on the phone
Combs,Excellent and nurses are helpful,10/16/2017,5,Always been very good to me.  I've had problems but they take time to talk to you and the nurses are very helpful
Combs,Excellent but getting appointments is hard and don't like explaining why I need one,10/16/2017,5,Don't like being asked what is wrong when booking an appointment.  Getting an appointment is tricky
Combs,Excellent but hard getting appointments. GP very good but some staff can be abrupt,10/16/2017,5,It was difficult to get an appointment and this seems to be getting worse.  I like the continuity as the doctor knows my history. My doctor is polite and listens to you.  It was great having the home visits when needed by the emergency care practitioner. Some staff can be a bit abrupt at times.
Combs,Excellent but hard to see own GP,10/16/2017,5,Never had a problem. My doctor saved my life. Getting to see her is difficult and means you have to spend so much time explaining your history to other doctors
Combs,Excellent but need more doctors,3/20/2017,5,"My doctor is brilliant, just a shame the practice can't attract more permanent doctors"
Combs,Excellent but problem with appointments,3/20/2017,5,Happy with the surgery.  I've been seeing the nurse practitioner who has been great.  The only problem is getting the appointments.  I've been offered phone backs which have been good+ also GP+ which isn't so good as I don't drive
Combs,Excellent care and approachable staff,12/20/2016,5,Excellent.  Whoever you see you're never afraid to ask the questions needed.  Very approachable staff
Combs,Excellent continuity of care,2/5/2018,5,"Been a patient for 7 years and have had excellent care from the Dr. They have monitored my condition and shown a keen interest in my wellbeing since my diagnosis in 2013. 

The front desk staff are polite and professional.

The website and the ability to order repeats online is very helpful."
Combs,Excellent nurses but prefer to see a GP,3/30/2017,5,It would be nice to see a GP rather than a nurse although the nurses have been excellent.  I find the reception staff at times are quite unhelpful.  I came in with a query but rather than advising or helping they said they couldn't do anything
Combs,Excellent service,12/20/2016,5,I don't use the service much but when I do it all works very well for me
Combs,Excellent service,5/19/2015,5,I & my family have been registered with the practice for 24 years & I can honestly say we have never had occasion to fault  the service & dedication we have received from the staff.
Combs,Excellent service but can't get appt on the day,3/20/2017,5,Booking on the day is difficult.  It's a brilliant service with great doctors.  Ideally keep to time but understand when it does run behind
Combs,Excellent staff but difficulty in getting through on the 'phone,12/20/2016,5,"Getting through on the phone is difficult in the morning and if you call after 8.30 all the appointments will be gone.  The staff however are really great,, very polite and good with children"
Combs,Excellent surgery,6/4/2018,5,Really like the new phone system its a great improvement. Staff have always been excellent too. There are lots of push button doors but not obvious hand cleaners.
Combs,Excellent treatment,3/20/2017,5,Been very happy with the treatment.  Treated like a human being;  they listen to what you say
Combs,Excellent treatment of leg ulcers,7/24/2015,5,The nurses were great when they were treating my leg ulcers over an extended period.
Combs,"Excellent treatment, no trouble getting appointments",12/20/2016,5,They've looked after me very well.  I've been happy here.  I see the nurses most and have no problems getting appointments.
Combs,"Excellent, everyone friendly and easy getting appointments",10/16/2017,5,"It's a nice surgery, everybody is friendly.  Phone to make  appointments works very well.  You can always get to see someone if you need an appointment"

Combs,"Excellent, helpful staff",12/20/2016,5,Staff have been great and if I am at all anxious they will check me over for any problems.  It's a nice friendly local surgery.  They will always do their best to get you fitted in.
Combs,"Excellent, professional and relaxed service",12/20/2016,5,Relaxed but efficient service and very professional
Combs,Excellent. Staff good an no problems with appointments,12/20/2016,5,"Never had any problems getting appointments  as an asthmati;they are always very accommodating.  Being able to see the nurse is great,  They are friendly and comforting: I prefer to see the nurses as they are so good."
Combs,Exceptional,11/2/2016,5,I find the service here exceptional and can not fault it at all.
Combs,Extremely good,10/23/2015,5,I think it's a very user friendly and conscientious practice and I'm glad to be here. I can't think of anything that needs improving.
Combs,Feel rushed sometimes,5/12/2019,5,"On the day appointments are fine for me, I have never had an issue getting one. I can feel a bit rushed in the surgery sometimes but overall this surgery is very good."
Combs,Fewer GPs now,7/10/2015,5,Considering there are fewer GPs now than ever before they are doing a great job and I can't speak more highly of the GPs and other staff.
Combs,Flu clinic excellent,9/23/2021,5,"The flu clinic last year was excellent, so quick and efficient. We drove up, were done in our car, it all went so quickly. Hoping this year will be as good."
Combs,Friendly and communicative staff,6/4/2018,5,"Good care provided, they liaise with the hospital well. it is difficult to get blood tests at the surgery. Friendly staff and the pharmacy will call you to check things are ok."
Combs,Friendly approachable staff,10/17/2016,5,"Friendly approachable staff. Sometimes a little bit of a wait but nothing too bad.
If you ask a question you always get a good and full answer.  It's not always possible to see your own doctor all the time which I'd prefer.  The nurses have been great"
Combs,Friendly staff,2/20/2019,5,"Staff are brilliant but I really don't like that there is a race to get through on the phone. It would be better to have more pre-book able appointments. Getting a blood test can mean a 3-4 week wait. If the doctor says you need to be seen it is easier to get an advanced appointment. I really like my doctor and the staff are friendly but I rarely get to see my own doctor because they are so busy and continuity for me is a big thing. The nurses are brilliant, they are very good because you get to see them more and you do get continuity."
Combs,Friendly staff,8/16/2018,5,"I can always get an appointment, may be not on the day all the time but with in a day or two. Staff are friendly and approachable and I really like the text reminder service. A previous doctor was incredibly supportive and understanding during a very difficult time for me and the nurse I see is very good and has also been very supportive."
Combs,Generally excellent,10/23/2015,5,"On a rare occasion I have found some staff a little unconcerned when I was particularly worried, but the service provided is excellent and we are lucky to be able to attend."
Combs,Generally happy,8/22/2018,5,For non urgent appointments it does take time to get appointments but generally I'm happy with the care provided.
Combs,Generally very happy,12/24/2021,5,"I use both the phone and Ask My GP and have got appointments both ways including face to face appointments when they've been needed. I'm generally very happy, it's a good surgery but please turn the fans off it is so bitterly cold in the waiting area with no heating, windows open and the fans on."
Combs,Get the support needed,7/11/2018,5,"No complaints at all, get the support I need from the surgery. Get the right advice from them and appointments are easy enough to get"
Combs,Getting appointments can vary,10/20/2016,5,"Getting an appointment earlier this year was very difficult.  However, this visit they did all they could to get me seen."
Combs,good,7/3/2019,5,I do like it here.  They listen to you and are kind and helpful .  Getting an appointment can be a little difficult but that is like most places.  The early & late appt. times are good as it gives you the option to be seen before or after work  Staff are helpful and will fit you in as soon as they can.  Generally you have to wait about 15 minutes which is ok unless I'm working
Combs,Good service,12/10/2015,5,I have a condition that flares up quickly and requires treatment. On one occasion I struggled to get an appointment as quickly as I needed. Other than that it's good.
Combs,Good service but poor continuity,3/30/2017,5,The service is good.  Not seeing the same GP all the time does make a difference to the care I receive.  There has been a high turnover of GPs but when you get to see them they are good.
Combs,"Good service,do have to wait for appointments",10/19/2015,5,I had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment to have blood taken. Overall treatment is very good though.
Combs,Good staff,2/25/2019,5,"Can always get an appointment when you need one and the staff are all very good, flexible and accommodating. Nothing needs to change."
Combs,Good staff,11/2/2019,5,"Never been any problems with the surgery, it's good. The staff have been very good and can I can get appointments when I need them. Having the call waiting on the phones in the queue it does at least mean you can get on with things while you're waiting."
Combs,GP shortage,7/10/2015,5,"As of August '15 the surgery will only have 2 GP for 10,000 patients! I have always received an excellent service at this surgery but i am very worried what will happen in  August"
Combs,Grateful for staff and my appointments,12/14/2017,5,Doctors very friendly & helpful and do what they can. Appointments are ok to book on the day. Generally it works for me.
Combs,Great dispensary,7/10/2015,5,"I've had a number of medication charges recently and the dispensary has been great. On one occasion I was nearly out of some medication before the weekend and they sorted it all out and on another occasion I needed new medication prescribed by the hospital added to my repeat prescription, this was all done quickly."
Combs,Great service,10/20/2016,5,"Very helpful staff.  On average the waits are good and on occasions I've been called ahead of time.  Couldn't get better service anywhere.

Having the visual screen to tell you when and where you need to go is very good."
Combs,Great you can see a nurse,5/9/2018,5,A good surgery where you get to see someone when you need an appointment. Its great that you can see a nurse or the emergency care practitioner instead of a doctor.
Combs,Happy so far,8/24/2019,5,"Only used once previously. Appointments are no concern, easy to make. I am so far happy with this surgery to date."
Combs,Happy to share details,10/19/2015,5,I'm happy to share details of why I need an appointment but when it is of a particularly personal nature I feel the staff can be quite insistent.

Combs,Happy with the service,10/19/2015,5,I'm quite happy with the service provided by the surgery.
Combs,Has worked well,12/23/2021,5,"I haven't needed an appointment for a few years but called yesterday and have been given an appointment this morning so its worked well.  The flu vaccination programme was also run very well last month, the process was very smooth."
Combs,Helpful staff,9/23/2021,5,My father finds the message on the phone very long and confusing so he is unable to call to book his appointments now. The number of options are too many for him and he can't cope with it. The staff are really helpful but the way in which the sliding window at reception is closed on you can appear a little rude.
Combs,Helpful staff,10/27/2017,5,Helpful surgery staff prevented an unnecessary trip to A&E
Combs,I am looked after.,10/17/2016,5,I get on well with the staff and when I come I am looked after by the staff.  Sometimes there is a slight delay but normally not more than 10 minutes.  You tend to get the information you ask for.  It all meets my needs and nothing needs to change
Combs,I dont like being asked whats wrong when booking,10/20/2016,5,"For a specific doctor the waiting time for appointments was about 2 weeks but generally it's not been as long as that.  Care from doctors and nurses has been good.
I don't like being asked what is wrong with me to book an appointment and when I've said I only want to discuss it with the doctor the response isn't always great."
Combs,I got an appointment today,10/17/2016,5,Generally the surgery has met my needs.  I've not used the surgery much but got an appointment today
Combs,I haven't had any problems,10/17/2016,5,"I haven't had any problems seeing a doctor and they have been very good.

Combs,Impressed by GP,10/19/2015,5,I visited my GP with a stomach issue with one touch she got straight on the phone to the hospital for treatment of the problem. I was treated very quickly and operated on soon after and have had no further problems. Impressed.
Combs,It's sometimes difficult to get the double appointments.,10/17/2016,5,Some waiting times but not excessive.  It's sometimes difficult to get the double appointments.  I'm really happy with the care and support provided by all staff.  They have been very supportive and understanding.  I've had a few issues with my prescription but hope to get it sorted today
Combs,Just want to say well done,9/20/2020,5,The flu jab administration carried out at the co-op car park Combsford was brilliant. Well done to all
Combs,Knowledgeable and very efficient,9/10/2015,5,"A knowledgeable and very efficient team. I saw the nurse on a regular matter, she asked about any other issues so I mentioned one thing and was referred to see the GP the next day and then on to West Suffolk Hospital in 2 days which you cant complain about."
Combs,Like online booking system,10/23/2015,5,I like using the online booking system. It's quick and easy to use and means you don't have to be on the phone for a long time.  I'm happy with the surgery.
Combs,Listen to what the problems are,3/18/2019,5,"Very responsive when you call, they organised a home visit really quickly. The queue system on the phone is an improvement and care navigation has been great and ensures the right person sees me. The staff are all kind and the emergency care practitioner i saw discussed the care needed very well and really listened to what the problems were, really great."
Combs,Love the surgery,3/10/2022,5,"I'm a complicated patient and need to be my own co ordinator around my health and appointments, but I do see the same GP which is really great and having that continuity really does help. Finding the hospital reports is often difficult on the system but I ensure I have copies of everything so that I can provide the information if and when it is needed."
Combs,Medication deliveries are great,3/18/2019,5,"It's great to get medications, I've had no problems and they deliver them which is great. Doctors and nurses are very good and helpful.tou never feel rushed in appointments and they don't mind if you go over your 10 minutes. To see a specific doctor,who I prefer to see , does take more time. She explains everything really well."
Combs,My Doctor is brilliant,10/20/2015,5,My doctor is brilliant.
Combs,My doctor is good,10/20/2016,5,My doctor is good. The attitude of the staff is very good.  Overall everything is very good and I'm happy.
Combs,My Doctor is wonderful,5/8/2016,5,My doctor is wonderful and she really has my condition under control.
Combs,My mothers care has been excellent,11/2/2016,5,"The way in which they have cared for my mother has been excellent. The doctor has been lovely, incredibly accommodating and has taken my mothers diagnosis in to consideration at every point. A few more chairs with arms for elderly would be better in the waiting area."
Combs,No complaints on the surgery,12/14/2017,5,Like that its local. The nurse is friendly and explains things well. Theres nothing that needs to change at the surgery.
Combs,No issues getting to see a nurse,11/2/2019,5,The surgery has very kind staff and appointments normaly run to time. I'm seeing a nursee at the moment for my legs to be dressed regularly and have had no issues getting appointments with her.
Combs,"No problem booking appointments, text message service works",6/27/2017,5,Everything is good.  Booking appointments isn't a problem.  Not worried if I don't see the same doctor.  Text message service works well.
Combs,No problems,11/2/2019,5,Not had any problems with getting appointments. The parking is normally ok which makes it easier to attend appointments here. Staff are generally friendly and helpful.
Combs,No problems at all,9/14/2022,5,"I have no problems with the surgery at all, from my experience it works very well and you can get appointments as and when you need them, it's all fine."

Combs,Nothing needs changing,6/27/2017,5,Works well. Can get appointments when needed.  Nothing needs changing
Combs,outstanding,1/29/2016,5,I would like to see more regular and widely available cancer health screening. At surgery it would be good if symptoms of cancer were followed up more quickly by practititoners.  My wife's diagnosis was very slow
Combs,outstanding,1/29/2016,5,I've been a patient for 25 years and have never had a problem with the care I receive.  Better continuity of care with doctors would improve the service as it would mean that mean that I do not have to go over my history each time I see a doctor
Combs,Outstanding,1/29/2016,5,As a family I feel that the surgery was incredibly supportive. We used them for a variety of reasons and can't fault the treatment and support where needed.  When you raise mental health issues the GP just handed me a ready to change business card rather than discussing things. I don't use a computer so the website was not even applicable.
Combs,Outstanding doctor,7/10/2015,5,"They wanted me to see a nurse without even knowing what was wrong! I insisted on seeing a doctor. They were thorough and kind, prescribed antibiotics for one problem and ordered blood tests for 6 others!"
Combs,Overall medical services are good,6/13/2016,5,"Overall the medical services are very good. I called to get an update on my blood tests and was told by reception if I hadn't heard they would be fine, however, two days later I got a call saying there was a problem with one of the tests. Getting blood a blood test at the surgery is difficult. After having a number of tests done I was asked to have another test but the first appointment available was in three weeks."
Combs,pain control and GP,8/19/2015,5,Following a total knee replacement I was experiencing a lot of breakthrough pain which was stopping me from doing the exercises.   Although not my named GP Dr. (Named removed) telephoned me not once but twice on Friday of last week.  They were able to reassure me and told me how I could adjust my medication to prevent the breakthrough pain.   She even telephoned me back to make sure I had enough medication to address the problem of constipation which the pain relief medication was causing.  I cannot thank them enough for taking the trouble to make sure I was pain free and comfortable.  I am now able to do my exercises without any problem.
Combs,Pleased with the practice,10/20/2015,5,I'm pleased with the practice and the care provided but you do sometimes have to wait a while for your appointments. This is understandable though and it's not a big problem.
Combs,Prefer to call,6/1/2022,5,I've used Ask My GP but I find it a little difficult to use and prefer to call the surgery as I find it works better. I've had face to face appointments with a doctor and I've found the staff very good when caring for someone with a learning disability. I feel the doctors are keeping up with the hygiene at the surgery and I'm happy that the surgery provide a proactive and caring service.
Combs,Prescriptions are always arranged on time.,10/20/2016,5,"Prescriptions are always arranged on time, never any problems.  When I've tried to get an appointment it's all worked well.  The service for me works very well."
Combs,Proactive nurse practitioner,11/2/2019,5,Normally runs to time and you can get appointments when you need them . The call waiting system is much better than before when you had to keep calling back.  Staff are helpful and the nurse practitioner i see is very good and proactive.
Combs,Quality care supported with great staff,12/14/2017,5,Care at the surgery is good. You don't get to see your own doctor much but I recently saw the nurse practitioner who was wonderfully reassuring.
Combs,Quick diagnosis,10/19/2015,5,"I visited my GP and she noticed a cause for concern on my arm, she referred me to West Suffolk Hospital to dermatology and  plastic surgery  removed the area and a biopsy showed it was a stage 1 melanoma. The hospital was impressed by the GP."
Combs,Quick to get medication,3/10/2022,5,I drop off my prescription and then 2 days later pick them up which is great. I haven't needed a doctors appointment for sometime but have had my annual review with a nurse which was great. Staff are good and it works well for me.
Combs,Quite good continuity,6/12/2018,5,"Never have a problem and can always get an appointment, you do also get quite good continuity with the doctors. I don't find the new chairs in the waiting area the comfiest, they're not too bad for a little while but after a while of sitting in them, they're not so good because the backs are quite laid back."
Combs,Rarely use,10/23/2015,5,I rarely use the surgery but everything has been fine in the past.
Combs,Really good experience,3/10/2022,5,I called first thing today and was encouraged to go online - but I don't have a computer so staff just booked me an appointment. I can't speak highly enough of the surgery.
Combs,Really helpful,10/23/2015,5,The staff are really helpful.
Combs,Really helpful nurses,7/10/2015,5,"I recently injured my hand, dressed it at home but the following day it started bleeding again, so I went to the surgery to see if a nurse could check and re-dress it. After initially being told no appointments were available for 2 days, I was then told I could wait to see when a nurse was free. I was been in 20 minutes. They dressed it and checked the wound. They squeezed me in for which I am very grateful."
Combs,Really like the nurse and lovely locum doctor,11/2/2016,5,"Getting an appointment when you need one is not a problem. I tend to see the nurse more often than the doctors, I really like the nurses and get to see them whenever I have a problem.  I had a really lovely locum doctor the other day who made multiple calls,to get me treated, while I was in the room. Dr was extremely understanding and did advise me to go to A&E after other avenues were blocked due to protocols. I had a letter which I took with me and was seen by the consultant and surgeon and both agreed I needed seeing before the two weeks which was the normal timescale."
Combs,Really listen,7/11/2018,5,Friendly and help you out a lot when needed. They are really listening and taking things forward which is great. A good supportive surgery.
Combs,Reception staff ask so many questions,5/12/2019,5,"They do listen well here, its only early days here for me I became a patient at this practice in 9 2019 but we are very happy with the surgery. I would prefer it if the reception staff didn't ask so many questions on the phone."
Combs,Receptionist has a lovely manner,5/12/2019,5,"They have been brilliant, the continuous care and onward referral to the hospital is excellent. The receptionists, particularly one has such a lovely manner. I can feel a little rushed sometimes with the GP."
Combs,Satisfied with the surgery,8/1/2018,5,Not had a problem. Staff are very pleasant and helpful. Care has been good. Generally it works well.
Combs,See my own doctor when I need to,11/2/2016,5,I get to see my own doctor when I need to see them. I come regularly for blood tests with the nurse and I can't find fault with them.
Combs,Sometimes certain staff can be unhelpful,10/20/2015,5,On more than one occasion I've found a member of the pharmacy team unhelpful (when trying to order new medication). When I asked the same question to another member of staff the next day it was all sorted. They have been really helpful on other occasions.
Combs,Sometimes there is a slight delay,10/20/2016,5,"Sometimes there are slight delays but people need more than the 10 minute allocation.

We have never had any problems with the surgery and can't fault them.  I prefer to see the same doctor to help with continuity and different treatment plans. But I particularly can't fault them."
Combs,Staff are excellent but 'phone system is complicated & confusing,12/20/2016,5,All staff are  generally very helpful.  The telephone system is quite complicated and the options take time and are confusing.
Combs,Staff are friendly,7/11/2018,5,"Appointments are easy to get, no problems really and staff are friendly. They explain things well and I would rather talk to someone than use Ask My GP as I have to get my daughter to help me with anything online. I've had lots of blood tests lately but never had any issues getting the appointments."
Combs,Staff are good but some long waiting times.,12/20/2016,5,"Staff are good.  Waiting times do vary a bit, sometimes you go in sraight away, others you can wait 25 minutes.  At times you have to see a nurse before seeing a doctor which delays treatment a bit."
Combs,Staff are great,6/1/2022,5,"Getting appointments is fine and the staff are great. I've always had a good experience when seeing the paramedic, they get things sorted out and do a great job."
Combs,Staff are lovely,11/2/2016,5,All the staff are lovely. If I take one of the children in but have a small query about the other they are happy to answer it.
Combs,Staff go out of their way for you,6/4/2018,5,Staff are very helpful and do what they can for you. Phoned this morning and was given an appointment straight away. There is no cleaning gel by the touch screen monitor.
Combs,Struggle to remember appointments,3/18/2019,5,Don't have any real issues with the surgery. I do struggle to remember the appointments and even though I have my mobile phone number registered I do t use it much so it doesn't help me remember appointments.

Combs,Tend to visit the surgery to book,7/11/2018,5,I tend to drive to the surgery to book my appointments as I feel this is the best way to be able to get an appointment.
Combs,Test results - person unable to explain,10/19/2015,5,When I was called with blood test results the person calling wasn't able to explain what the problem was but said I needed another blood test. The second blood test results came through and I received an update.
Combs,The service works well the Dr's are all nice,10/17/2016,5,A family practice.  They try to get you to see the same doctor if possible but they are all nice.  The service works well and meets my needs.

Combs,Very good care service,3/15/2018,5,"The staff were very good when we went to the surgery, when I wasn't very well. It was lunch time but they told me to sit down and got a nurse straightaway which was very good. She did an ECG and other test which was very good."
Combs,Very good indeed,6/1/2022,5,I really can't fault the surgery or the staff as the care provided is always excellent. I can always get  an appointment when I need one and have been offered telephone or face to face appointments depending which is most appropriate.
Combs,Very good service,12/2/2019,5,"Find it a very good service, when I phone for an appointment I get one n the day which is good. Staff are friendly and approachable and I tend to see the same doctor which I do like. My carers pick up my medication for me and there are never any problems."
Combs,Very good staff and communications,12/20/2016,5,"Very good staff.  I don't come very often but when I do they explain things well.
I got straight through on the phone this morning"
Combs,Very good surgery,1/23/2023,5,Its a very very good surgery and they are quick at addressing any issues that come up. I do prefer to speak to people on the phone but I've got used to Ask My GP now and I have had quick responses when I've used it. The staff are very good but I do feel the dispensary staff could've explained the process  in a nicer way.
Combs,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"I use Ask My GP and really like it as you get a quick response and appointments quickly if you needed.

Combs,Very helpful staff but some difficulty with communicating with GP's.,12/20/2016,5,Very helpful staff.  Never any excessive waits.  Communication with some doctors can be a little tricky and use of medical terminology doesn't help.  Online system works really well. It woud be nice if there were some early appointment times available
Combs,Very please with the treatment and easy getting an appointment,12/20/2016,5,Easy to get an appointment.  Getting to see the nurse to have a wound re-dressed was really easy and I was seen the same day.  I then booked to come back and have the stitches out.  Very pleased

Combs,Waiting times for appointmennts are okay,6/4/2018,5,"Easy to get appointments, can call up and get an appointment within 8 days for general things. To get a blood test has taken 3 weeks this time and for the last few years."
Combs,Wary of confidentiality,6/4/2018,5,"Most of the time if you really need an appointment they will always see you. With the new care navigation, a concern is around the confidentiality of discussing issues in a busy waiting area. Never had a problem with the surgery though."
Combs,Working well,9/23/2021,5,"Phoning up for appointments is working well, staff are wonderful and are really helpful. Its an excellent service, I've got nothing I'm concerned about, generally very happy. There is one issue in the car park, one of the trees protrudes in to one of the parking spaces slightly."
Combs,Works well,6/1/2022,5,"I haven't needed appointments recently until this week but I used Ask My GP and got a call back from a GP and then was invited straight down to the surgery for an appointment.

I was also able to get a blood test quickly and had no issues getting seen  this week."

Combs,Works well with nurse practitioner,3/18/2019,5,"When you need an appointment you will get seen but normally with the nurse practitioner, which has worked well. Quite happy that I see the nurse and they will always get the doctor involved if needed, the nurse I see is lovely. Very good all round at explaining things. Every time I need an appointment I can get one which is all I need. It's nice to have the queue system and it does go down quickly, it's better than having to call back."
Combs,Would be nice to be listened to more,8/13/2018,5,Not had any issues with the surgery. For non urgent issues you can see the nurse practitioner but at times you may need more than they can prescribe and it then requires another visit to the surgery to see a GP. It would be nice if your experience with long term conditions was listened to more.
Constable,20 minute wait.,3/2/2017,5,The only issue is that you often have to wait 20 minutes past your time of appointment.  Overall getting appointments has been ok
Constable,4 Stars,11/20/2015,4,4 Stars
Constable,access improved,7/8/2015,5,"Getting through in the morning has improved and it's not as difficult as it has been in the past.
My husband has not been invited to annual health checks but I have.  Is there a difference for men and women? A well women clinic would also be good to have at the surgery"
Constable,Accomodating surgery,2/11/2018,5,"A really good surgery, very accommodating and obliging. The nurses have been brilliant and reception staff are very helpful. Getting a home visit recently was easy and having a chat with the doctor on the phone the same. When seeing the nurse practitioner they will always call in the doctor if they are concerned. I am slightly concerned how the surgery will cope with additional housing in the village."
Constable,Accomodating with appointments,8/13/2018,4,Already running 25 minutes late this morning. The surgery staff have been very accomodating with advanced appointments.
Constable,Admin delay with my medication review,1/9/2016,4,There is often an admin delay when I've had my annual medication review.  The system isn't updated quickly enough so I am unable to re-order my repeat and have to get an emergency monthly order but this is sorted out for me
Constable,Advanced appointments are limited,8/13/2018,4,Having a local service is important.  It can be difficult to get appointments on the day and advanced appointments are limited. When I do use the service I can get appointments and they have very helpful staff.
Constable,All the information I need,1/9/2016,5,I get all the information I need and get our prescriptions on time.
Constable,Always satisfied,4/15/2016,4,Always been satisfied. All staff have a good attitude and as a cancer patient I've always received excellent care.
Constable,am or pm phone Appointments not working,2/28/2020,1,I telephoned at 9.30am and was told the doctor would call would I like am or pm I said am which should be before 1pm I got the call at 4.45pm this is not the first time as I called another day for appointment all for the same ongoing problem and was ask am or pm I chose am and I got a call at nearly 3pm. they think you have nothing better to do with your day than sit by the phone all day waiting for them to call whats the point in asking if you want am or pm if the dr does not follow this you cant even go out because you can guarantee as you are driving that's when they will call
Constable,Annual Asthma check on 2nd March,4/16/2020,5,"Was very helpful- I had been suffer 3 weeks of bronchitis (I did call in to tell the staff what was going on & they said to come in). They recommended I increase my Easyhaler for a short time so not so heavy on Ventolin and bring breathing under control. This worked. BUT in hindsight, because I've had bronchitis before and this last episode was nothing like it, and because of the severity of the dry cough (every 5 seconds for days- all dry coughing and wheezing) I believe I might have had coronavirus. I came down with bronchitis just 3 days after returning from a trip up north with a stop for a sandwich at Peterborough rest stop- the place was packed I did call and speak to one of the practice doctors who thought I might have had it as well, but I can't get an antibody test at this time. Fortunately I isolated with the bronchitis and have ever since."
Constable,Annual health checks & excellent pharmacy,10/12/2017,4,"I had to ask for an annual health check but for the past 2 years I've asked for one but I'm not sure if I'm eligible or not, even though care from the doctors is good. Communication can be difficult.

The pharmacy is brilliant, having the confidential meeting room is very good. Very good at explaining things and discussing situations."
Constable,Anything to do with the nurses is excellent,4/15/2016,2,"The locum doctors that have been on recently have been good. Nurses have a very good attitude, anything to do with them is excellent. In the past one of the doctors prescribed inappropriate medication which was picked up when I went to the pharmacy to pick up the medication. The waiting times are not too bad."
Constable,Appointment,7/23/2019,5,I had an appointment and the doctor listened and gave good advice.  I highly recommend them.
Constable,Appointment booking problems.,11/13/2017,4,"Continuity is an issue.  Doctor asked to see me in two weeks but you can't make an appointment in advance and have to phone on the day, hope you get an appointment and get to see the same doctor again.  Generally it's an ok surgery."
Constable,Appointment easy to get,1/3/2022,5,Its been easy to get an appointment today and with the clinician of my choice. Previously it took a bit more time to get appointments but staff have been friendly when talking with them and I'm pretty happy with how it's all working.
Constable,Appointment for granddaughter,9/1/2020,4,"Telephoned yesterday  815 am for  for my granddaughter to speak to doctor,the dr rang her before 9am and she was given an appointment for 10am .l think the new system works well.( this the 3rd positive experience of this service)"
Constable,"Appointment system can be difficult, friendly surgery",7/4/2017,3,The only way to get an appointment is to phone on the day which for non urgent issues makes it difficult to plan.  Nice friendly surgery which has a good feel
Constable,Appointment system is much better,11/26/2015,5,"The new appointment system is much better compared to what was previously in place. Recently I had a minor operation which needed regular dressing changes, the nursing team have been fantastic."
Constable,Appointment system slow.,12/5/2016,3,Appointment system slow but better. Difficulty in seeing same doctor more than once!!
Constable,Appointment system working better,11/26/2015,4,Moved recently to the area. Practice as good as last GP surgery. More continuity of care in last practice though appointment system is working better.
Constable,Appointment system works well,12/8/2021,4,The econsults and call backs from doctors have worked well and have resulted in a face to face appointment when needed. The staff are all friendly and helpful. At the moment there does seem to be a crackly telephone line which makes hearing what is being said more difficult but can't be sure if the issue is with their system.
Constable,Appointments,6/7/2016,3,It is difficult to make future appointments
Constable,Appointments always seem to run behind,10/8/2015,4,"Appointments always seem to run behind in the past I've booked early morning (8.30) appointments but they are regularly behind even at that time. If you can't prebook it makes it difficult, Always have to wait on the phone when booking appointments. If I can't get an appointment I have used the walk in clinic in Colchester. mixing work, access to transport and children can make getting appointments very difficult. If my children are unwell I would be confident that they would be seen on the day by a doctor."
Constable,Appointments problematical. Receptionists are helpful.,11/13/2017,2,Difficult to get appointments but the call waiting system is an improvement. It's difficult to see specific doctors.  Do on occasions hear people being told that they should be at the other surgery for their appointments.  Receptionists are very helpful. Making follow up appointments with the same doctor is very difficult;  you would have to ring up on the day. My last experience was better.
Constable,Appreciated the assistance.,11/13/2017,5,The receptionist today has been really great/  So wonderful and very helpful which makes such a big difference
Constable,Attitude has not been great,4/13/2016,4,I've decided not to see one of the doctors due to the attitude when seen by them. They have been dismissive and deliberately argumentative or challenging.
Constable,Availability of online appointments limited,4/21/2016,2,Treatment explanation and staff attitude is good but getting through for appointments is difficult and you know that appointments will be taken very quickly. The availability of online appointments is not good either. I have waited over an hour for my appointment.
Constable,Bedside manner lacking,1/8/2017,3,"Things have got better over the last fortnight. I've seen 3 different doctors in the last fortnight and 2 of the locums have been good. They just don't have a bedside manner at times, was asked what do you want me to do about it when asked for a home visit. Also medication was wrongly prescribed."
Constable,been very good.,3/2/2017,5,Recently not had any problems getting appointment.  The surgery has been very good and responsive in the care of the inlaws
Constable,Best practice in the area,12/11/2022,5,"Very good experience, good staff and service. Reception were very helpful and nurse was very professional and knowledgeable."
Constable,Blood tests easy to get,10/15/2021,5,I'm satisfied as I'm able to get blood tests when I need them and the nurse helpfully books my appointments going forward. All the staff are very helpful and they are working hard to keep on top of my different issues such as diabetes.
Constable,Book at the surgery rather than calling,7/27/2018,3,I live locally so tend to walk to the surgery to book appointments rather than trying to get through on the phone. It can be difficult to get an appointment though.
Constable,Booking advanced appointments is great,4/15/2016,4,"Booking advance appointments 3 or 4 days ahead of time is great and I don't generally have an issue getting an appointment. I don't visit very often but generally see the nurses when I do, I feel they are as good as the doctors.,"
Constable,call backs work well,9/4/2019,4,"I don't like calling on the day for appointments as you don't have any continuity with who you see and you have to wait a long time on the phone, I was 26th in the queue today, you can then be told that no appointments are available. They do then offer for you to speak to a doctor which is good. If it was really urgent Im sure you would be seen."
Constable,Calling in the morning is difficult,8/13/2018,3,Calling in first thing in the morning to get an appointment is the biggest problem.
Constable,"can be tricky to get appointment, helpful receptionist",7/4/2017,4,It's a little tricky at times to get an appointment but if you really need an appointment they will fit you in.  When calling for an appointment it can take a while to get through.  Some of the locums used have been good. The receptionist on today is always so polite and helpful and cheerful
Constable,Can get an appointment when needed,1/9/2016,4,"Generally when I call I can get an appointment when I need one .  On the odd occasion it is a little more difficult,   Very polite staff, very nice doctor who handled my concerns well.  Waiting times can be a bit long if they are busy.  Everyone is polite"
Constable,Can get appointments when needed,3/30/2017,5,Can get appointments when needed.  At times it can take a while  to get through on the phones but results in an appointment.  Booking in computer doesn't always work.  The tv screen could be used more than it is.  The column in reception does block the display board.  I realise it can't be moved but it does get in the way a bit
Constable,Can't fault the service,3/2/2017,5,Very accommodating.  Can't fault the service provided.  A friendly surgery and the reception staff are very accomodating
Constable,Care is generally good,9/8/2018,4,Generally you can get an appointment when you need one but doctors will also do a call back if needed. I don't particularly like this as I find it difficult to explain things on the phone. You don't get to see the same GP as there are so many GPs but care is generally good.
Constable,Care is good,8/13/2018,3,"Its very difficult to get appointments that fit well. When you do get in the care is good and the locums have been very good. The reception staff have been really helpful and friendly, I've been fitted in this morning and was told I could wait to see the doctor."
Constable,Caring doctor and staff,7/2/2023,5,"Rang to speak to GP ,was given an appointment that morning,the consultation resulted in need for ECG,(done there and then) and then saw the doctor again who was very caring ."
Constable,Challenging,12/14/2022,4,"It's challenging trying to get through on the phone, I was waiting about half an hour this time which isn't easy when trying to get to work. Once you speak to or see a doctor or nurse it's all good."
Constable,Change in medication not actioned,10/5/2016,2,When my husband went to collect his prescription the Pharmacist said some other tablets were there for him to collect. We knew nothing about them so ask his consultant who said he should've been on them for the last few months after he had requested the change. Not sure why we weren't informed or why it took so long.
Constable,Chemist is brilliant,10/5/2016,2,I was with a doctor recently and he kept saying he was running late which made me feel I was being a nuisance and then the next patient opened the door with me still in the room. The chemist is brilliant.
Constable,Communication needs to be improved.,11/13/2017,3,Treatment explanation has been limited;  at time of diagnosis you are told what is wrong but not given any follow up support.
Constable,Communication with hospital not great,9/4/2019,3,"Communication between the hospital and the surgery is not great. The surgery do not have up to date information about me which makes getting medication and follow up help an issue. Appointments are not always easy to get and you spend a long time on the phone, I can get to the surgery so I go down and queue for an appointment as its easier and you are more assured you will get an appointment. Even when you call first thing you can be told there are no appointments available."
Constable,Confident in the care,1/3/2022,4,There are no issues getting appointments. I don't visit the surgery often and I'm happy to see any GP as they are good at explaining things and I'm confident in the care provided. There can be delays getting medication  from the chemist and having a pharmacy on site like at Capel would be more convenient and less problematic.
Constable,Confidentiality at reception,8/9/2016,4,No confidential reception desk
Constable,Consistency of nursing care could be better,6/18/2019,4,"Consistency of same GP is OK, you do have to wait though. I have been shuffled around several nurses so the consistency could be better with nurses.Booking of appointments here is a challenge, can only have on the day appointments. Would prefer to book ahead though and you can't do that here."
Constable,Consistently bad experience,11/17/2020,1,"uncaring doctors with terrible bedside manners.  Doctors never understand my conditions, can never see the same doctor, can take days to even speak to a doctor and then they have no knowledge about my conditions or medication.  Never have I felt so poorly served by the medical profession."
Constable,Continuity of care is not great,4/21/2016,3,"GP turnover is very high. Very difficult to get appointments on the phone its easier to come in person. Continuity of care is lacking with the different doctors and when explaining they can give different explanations. There can be long waits to see doctors and I sometimes feel 10 minutes is not enough to enable questions to be asked. There is a lack of general organisation, changing processes for booking system can be confusing."
Constable,Continuity of care reduced,6/18/2019,4,"Consistency of seeing the same person could be better, it used to be better years ago."
Constable,Convenient and works well,7/4/2017,5,Having the flexibility to attend either surgery.  The triage system worked well this morning after I was told no appointments were available.  I spoke to the doctor who arranged for me to be seen this morning.  Generally going into the Capel surgery makes it easier to get an appointment than trying to call.
Constable,"Convenient, under-staffed but good care",3/15/2018,3,Close local surgery. They do need more staff which is difficult for them. Care generally is good but people have different way of talking to you.
Constable,Could not order medication as needed review,1/9/2019,1,"Unable to order medication until had review, phoned doctors again to remind them was told medication already prescribed and waiting at chemist!! No review done. Also medicine which I had 2 years ago and not requested was waiting for me at the chemist also. Even the pharmacist said how bad this was!! Total mess at surgery"
Constable,Covid and Flu clinics great,10/15/2021,4,I generally don't visit too often other than for prescriptions but both the covid and flu vaccination sessions have gone really smoothly. The only issue with the flu clinic was that I was unable to book online for some reason but reception staff booked me in which was great.
Constable,COVID vaccination for my dad.,10/18/2022,5,"I drove from Clacton to an arranged COVID appointment at another practice for my dad who lives in Layham. On way to collect him his appointment was cancelled. I felt very desperate as I knew he'd feel stressed, and as passing this practice where he'd had 2nd vaccination I called in. The receptionist was amazing..as was the nurse who did the vaccination for my dad when I brought him in 20 mins later. We are so very grateful. Can't thank you enough. Congratulations on an amazing practice. Wish I was a patient there."
Constable,Covid vaccinations were done well,11/8/2021,5,The surgery did really well with the covid vaccinations they did. Mum and Dad both had them done at the surgery and it went really smoothly. They were contacted by the surgery as neither have a mobile phone and got their appointments quickly.
Constable,"Degrading, unprofessional,rude not efficient",4/29/2020,1,"One of my clients had a fall and a and e had bandaged and steri stripped it up, it was still bleeding and leaking on day one we could not get an appointment so my client had to call 111 in the end who had to send an ambulance... I ask reception if we could book a nurse visit for next they said Dr will call you first still awaiting Dr call  day two the receptionist sent us to East bergholt and insisted there was no home visits available and this client is extremely vulnerable to covid -19 , I made reception aware of this.when getting to East bergholt nurse was extremely degrading told her she is not allowed to be there because she's vulnerable because she had seen her notes and because she had a cough ( which is on system that she has had for over 6months!!!) And was snappy throughout appointments to the point that when my client left she cried and said even NHS don't want me alive!!!! My next message is to cqc, CCG and Suffolk county council. I'm so upset that she hasn't received necessary care when needed and if she did not have our help to make appointment then I feel she would have gave up at first hurdle they made."
Constable,Diabetic checks,1/3/2022,4,"Throughout covid I had my diabetic foot checks but I don't really feel I've had a review during that time although I've been called in for one today.  The nurses are always good when you see them, they are friendly and approachable."
Constable,Different attitudes experienced,1/8/2017,1,"Dr xxxx said at your age we don't do anything about that. Patient complained to Practice, 3 months later got a sort of apology letter saying Dr xxxx didn't say things like that. Saw a different doctor who referred the patient to hospital and got treatment in 3 weeks - totally different attitude."
Constable,Difficult to call if you work,9/8/2018,3,Its very difficult getting appointments especially when you work as you can't always phone at 8am. Have had an instance where a doctor said to come back and see them in three weeks but when I tried to book with reception staff they were unable to offer an appointment as the GP had suggested.
Constable,Difficult to get a phlebotomist appointment,10/24/2019,3,I do find it difficult to get a phlebotomist appointment and if they can't fit me in I have to travel to Ipswich which is inconvenient. Its only 10 minutes for one appointment and I sometimes need longer.
Constable,Difficult to get appointments,9/11/2018,3,It can still be difficult to get an appointment at the surgery. I did see the doctor recently at an emergency appointment but felt that advice was a little limited and dressings provided weren't overly suitable
Constable,Difficult to get appointments,4/20/2016,3,"Getting through on the phone for appointments is very difficult. I was on hold for 20 minutes in total and couldn't see the doctor I wanted as all appointments were already gone.  The popular doctor is also a teaching doctor but this means he's available even less.  I do not get any updates about results that come in unless there is something wrong, I'd prefer to be told even if nothing is wrong as you presume all is ok but they may have forgotten to call.  When I was in an appointment the next patient walked in as the doctor had already pressed the next patient button before I had actually finished. I feel that reception should be manned and it would give a better impression."
Constable,Difficult to get appointments,4/13/2016,3,"Bad as ever for appointments, never bother to ring come in person. The locums give you more time and explanation. Staff attitude can depend on who you get on reception and you can wait past your appointment time."
Constable,Difficult to see a specific dr.,3/2/2017,3,It's been very difficult to get to see a specific doctor.  Communication at times can be difficult with doctor.  The surgery seems to lose a lot of staff so there is little continuity.  I think that the surgery has made improvements which have had a positive impact on patients
Constable,Difficult to speak to a Dr about your concerns.,9/2/2017,4,Care and understanding for children has been a bit limited and could be improved upon.  To get to speak to an understanding doctor about your concerns is difficult.  If they don't see the problem there in front of them it feels like they disregard your concerns.  Adult care is different and isn't too bad.
Constable,Difficulty contacting the surgery due to work,9/11/2018,3,There are never any online appointments for short notice appointments and as I have difficulties taking calls at work it is difficult to call during the day.It would be helpful to have more appointments available. I do see a particular nurse who has been very good.
Constable,Difficulty getting through to the surgery,4/20/2016,2,Had to make 70 calls to get an appointment this morning - eventually got through at 8.20am.
Constable,'District Nurses have been helpful,11/26/2015,4,'District Nurses have been helpful - looked after extremely well
Constable,"doctors are argumentative, reception isnt manned, difficult to get appointment",7/4/2017,1,The doctors are quite argumentative and difficult.  Reception often isn't manned.  Getting appointments is difficult.  I've complained in the past but I have not had any response
Constable,Doctors are usually great,4/20/2016,3,Good doctors but not very good admin. Difficulty n getting appointments. I'm concerned that admin are asking what is wrong with patients and possibly influencing experience offered by doctor. You do have to wait but that is to be expected up to a reasonable time. This morning it took 10 minutes to get through and a further 15 minutes on hold. If the practice phone a patient it would be good if they could leave a message to alleviate worry.There should be more people answering the phones around peak times and there is an issue around follow up appointment availability.
Constable,Doctors are very helpful.,11/13/2017,5,"General care from the doctors has been very good but you do get very different opinions from different doctors.  Care is outstanding, very patient.  One doctor discussed changes to medication very well and has really changed mental health support."
Constable,Doctors can be rude,1/8/2017,1,"Doctors are very rude, they don't listen to you or take your concerns seriously. One child became very unwell when our concerns were dismissed. Reception staff can also be rude at times."
Constable,"doctors explain everything, easier to book in surgery for appointments",7/4/2017,5,Doctors are good. They explain everything to you.  If you come to the surgery to book an appointment it's much easier than trying to call
Constable,Does run behind,9/4/2019,4,"The care you get once you see someone is good however, I don't like how behind they run all the time. If you're given an appointment time you should be seen then, especially when it is frowned upon if you are even slightly late arriving."
Constable,Don't like call backs,12/12/2022,3,I don't like having to wait for the call backs from a doctor.  If you miss the call you have to call the surgery back and then wait again. I'm happy with the staff as they explain issues well but the phones are busy and I haven't found that econsult has worked well for me to get the help when I've needed it either.
Constable,Dreadful,7/28/2021,1,"I called at 3pm on a Monday to report that I had a severe UTI and needed antibiotics straight away (I have a very low kidney function). Was told there were no appointments, I said I didnt need an APPOINTMENT, just the prescription. I am more than well acquainted with my condition and know when I need antibiotics straight away. Receptionist told me that if I didn't want to ring again in the morning, then to phone NHS 111. 

After wasting many hours on the phone etc. I was told that my turn up time at Ipswich Hospital was 9.45 pm. I eventually got at home at 3.30am the following day. More than 12 hours had gone past where I was untreated. I have spoken to a consultant who was deeply concerned and said it was a very serious infection and I was very lucky that it had not caused permanent damage. I will not bother contacting the surgery. All I will get is a lot of platitudes."
Constable,Easier to drive to surgery than call,3/13/2019,2,"Very difficult to get an appointment, its easier to drive to the surgery and speak to reception rather than phoning as it takes so long to get through, this has been a long term issue. Even if you are only 16th in the queue it takes a long time to get answered. Care provided by medical staff is quite good."
Constable,Easier to get appointments,2/11/2018,5,"You can now get appointments more easily compared to a couple of years ago. I would like more permanent GP's on staff as they are quiet reliant on locums. There is generally quite a high turnover of staff which is a shame. With today's technology it would be good to be able to contact the surgery out of hours, especially when you know an appointment will be required. However, it is important not to forget that some people don't have access to online services. Care has been very good and getting a home visit recently wasn't difficult and the doctor came out quickly."
Constable,Easier to get appointments but staff can be dismissive,4/4/2017,3,The service has improved recently and it's easier to get appointments.  House call requests for people work ok and the doctors will visit when needed.  At times reception staff don't listen and can be a bit dismissive and unhelpful at times
Constable,Excellent,10/18/2022,5,Followed text message link to book flu vacs at 2.30 pm. All done by 4.05 pm. All with a friendly smile and kindness.
Constable,Excellent,3/2/2017,5,Been very good to me
Constable,excellent,9/14/2017,5,On occasions at the end of the day I've noticed staff have been a little less friendly and approachable. I rang up 10.45 and got an apt at 11.30 with the nurse practitioner and generally getting an appointment isn't a problem.  I went on medication but it was not explained how and when I should stop so I had to read the leaflet inside the package.
Constable,excellent,9/14/2017,5,As a new patient this is my first visit but getting an apt today was ok & my notes have hopefully arrived
Constable,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I ask for information from the doctors if I need it. We've been lucky that we can always get an appointment when we need one.
Constable,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I haven't found any faults at all.  They are very attentive & remind me of check.  If I need an urgent appointment I get one the same day
Constable,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"One of the doctors is very dismissive, can be rude and made me feel I was wasting their time.  I will no longer see this doctor as it happened on more than one occasion.  Quite long delay, expect it as they are very busy & I'd rather they did their job properly"
Constable,Excellent care and very friendly staff,7/17/2018,5,"In the time that I have been using the surgery, I have only had positive experiences.  Appointments have been booked easily and there is a very high level of care given.  For a surgery with a large catchment area and an older demographic, I think the surgery copes incredibly well."
Constable,Excellent easy getting appointments,3/20/2017,5,"Never had a problem.  Can get appointments when needed.  The time, room and name for appointment shown on the board could be slightly longer to allow full reading"
Constable,Excellent service,6/18/2016,4,I had had excellent service on behalf of my neighbour. The Doctors have been very good.
Constable,Excellent staff and easy getting appointments,3/20/2017,5,Currently not having any problems getting appointments.  Very nice and friendly staff.  They will do all they can to help sort problems out.  The nurse I see is really really nice
Constable,Excellent vaccination service,11/28/2018,5,Also good advice given.
Constable,fair,1/9/2016,3,"There have been a couple of times when I've been given an appointment here but told I should be at Capel.
I also had an occasion at Capel when I arrived I was told I was late but luckily I had my booking card which had the time I'd arrived written on it. It's not always clear that I've ben booked to see a nurse practitioner rather than a GP.  
Overall staff are very good.
I would like more explanation so that I know what to expect and what side effects may result from taking new medication.
It would be nice to see the same doctor but I realise this is not always possible now"
Constable,fair,6/21/2016,3,Getting through on the phone at abut 8.10 I did get an appt.  When I saw the GP they told me I had only been allocated 5 minutes but I was given all the time I needed.  Overall the care received is good.
Constable,fair,6/21/2016,3,never see the same doctor twice
Constable,fair,6/21/2016,3,The big issue is that you can't get to see who you want or book in advance.  If you start to ring at 8 am and don't get through until 8.20 there won't be any left.  Continuity for people with ongoing issues is a problem having to wait for my appointment in the surgery is not a problem
Constable,fair,6/21/2016,3,"The nurses do a good job, some are very professional.  Getting to see a familiar doctor is difficult as you still have to ring on the day to see who is available.  Online appointments generally only get a couple of doctors available so if you want to see someone else have to wait and call on the day."
Constable,fair,6/21/2016,3,Waiting times generally aren't too bad but today they are running behind
Constable,fair,6/21/2016,3,Appointment was for 9.30 and they are already 20 mins late at least. Getting an appointment : rang this... The amount of information given in consultation is very limited.  You do feel pressure to finish the appt. and not able to raise other issues when you don't know if they are related or not
Constable,Fair but waiting times are a problem and some GP's unfriendly,11/13/2017,3,Waiting times always problematic.  Certain couple of doctors unfriendly.
Constable,Fair but waiting times can vary.,3/30/2017,3,Waiting times can vary.  Have been waiting over an hour with a child before and it seems to be worse at East Bergholt than Capel.  Sometimes feel a bit rushed and doctors don't give you eye contact (look at computer)
Constable,Fairly poor at the moment,12/12/2022,2,"My daughter has not been seen throughout covid and since with everything being done by phone, we've recently found out they've been treating her for the wrong thing.  They rush you through when on the phone and don't really listen to what you are saying, almost making their minds up quickly with limited input from the family. The nurses though have been very good and they do listen well.  Econsult has de personalised care and treatment and there are times where a face to face is needed as it feels like it is just a barrier to being seen.  If you miss a call back you then have to contact the surgery again, they need to let the phone ring longer as people do work and can't always instantly answer the phone."
Constable,Feel I need to be seen,2/3/2022,3,"I've been able to get appointments with clinicians other than the doctors. I saw a nurse and was given antibiotics but they haven't helped and I'm now back to see a different clinician, so there's no continuity and I do feel I need to see a doctor for the issue I have."
Constable,Feel like I'm being held at bay by locums,4/19/2016,2,"I have managed to get an appointment with a doctor today but it can be very difficult. Seeing the locums can feel like you are being held at bay as they say come back in 2 weeks. I feel that there is no follow up care once I've been seen by the hospital, letters go on my file but no action follows. At times reception staff could be a bit less abrupt."
Constable,Find conversations on phone difficult,2/3/2022,4,I would like to see doctors face to face as I find conversations on the phone with them difficult as I can't get my thoughts together or across to them in a quick conversation.
Constable,Flexible home service by the nurse,10/12/2017,5,Working well at the moment. Can be a little difficult to get appointments. The surgery nurse now comes out to me to do my INR blood tests as I'm unable to get to the surgery.
Constable,Four stars,11/26/2015,4,Four stars
Constable,"freinfly and helpful, management hard to approach though",7/4/2017,4,All the staff are friendly and helpful.  They always explain everything well and put you at ease.  It would be better if it was easier to approach the management
Constable,Friendly reception staff,3/13/2019,4,"You get a friendly service from reception staff, it would be nice to be able to have some pre bookable appointments as it makes it difficult to plan ahead and means you have to call back first thing in the morning and struggle to get through."
Constable,Friendly staff,2/11/2018,5,Staff are friendly and helpful. I can usually get an appointment when I need one. The nurses are very good and its a very good surgery where they are under pressure but do a good job.
Constable,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,5,"No complaints, staff are always friendly and doctors will explain things to me or my family. The surgery is nice and warm in the winter."
Constable,"Friendly staff, building needs some tlc",8/20/2018,5,Friendly approached reception staff and doctors.
Constable,"friendly staff, triage system works",7/4/2017,4,Friendly staff.  The triage system worked this morning and I got an appointment after speaking to the doctor.  Being restricted to phoning at 8 am makes it difficult when trying to get children ready for school.  Having a separate time to call in the afternoon to call for advance appointments would help
Constable,Friendly staff; information not forthcoming,3/15/2018,4,"Staff are friendly. Not too difficult to get an appointment, you just have to be on the line for a while. If this could be improved it would be better. Having a blood test at the surgery could mean a 2 week wait as it is not always possible to get to the Riverside. At times information is not forth coming but if you ask they will say."
Constable,Generally a good surgery but hard to see specific doctor.,4/28/2017,4,"Generally a good surgery but getting an appointment with a specific doctor is difficult. They are very obliging staff and although appointments can run behind I'm also given the time I need in my appointment. I like the atmosphere at the surgery. 

It would reduce practitioner time if blood tests and blood pressure checks were done at the same appointment rather than separately. Sometimes the information about why tests are being carried out is a little vague. One doctor gives very little eye contact and seems over reliant on the internet to make decisions. I have had an appointment with a trainee doctor and they were brilliant."
Constable,Generally awful,7/9/2018,1,"I have been meaning to change surgery for a few years but still haven't. I tend to use the walk-in centre in Colchester if I need to see someone as there are only generally ""same day"" appointments with one particular GP - and I find them very rude.  Nurses and reception are OK"
Constable,Generally good for me,6/18/2019,4,"Pretty prompt, had a call back this morning and discussed the issue and have been given an appointment with the doctor. Even though I was 37th in the queue I got through within about 12 minutes and it worked really well. 
Concerned about the increased development in the area.
The pharmacy at Capel can be delayed getting medication, you go to collect and they're not ready, but they say they'll have them for later in the day, the reception staff normally know what the situation is with the family and just sort things out."
Constable,Generally happy,10/15/2021,4,"I'm generally happy with the practice, I can get appointments when I need them with no real issues and prescriptions are easy enough too."
Constable,Generally regular injections are good,11/26/2015,5,Generally when my husband has injections we have been really pleased with the way the treatments have been carried out. But when treated 3 months ago the experience was not good and he was in pain for the rest of the day.
Constable,Generally very accommodating,6/18/2019,4,"Generally very accommodating.
Clean and tidy surgery, very friendly and helpful staff.
I am happy to discuss issues with staff, I can't always get an appointment when I'd like, but generally you do get to see someone if it's needed."
Constable,getting an appointment is not a problem,1/9/2016,5,I have weekly blood tests and getting the appointment is not a problem.  I call up and c go to Capel or East Bergholt. Staff explain everything fully.  It all works for me and they do their best
Constable,Getting appointments is difficult,4/19/2016,2,I do not like having to phone on the day for appointments. After the CQC inspection they allowed me to book in advance but this has now gone again and you can only book on the day. I previously tried to get an appointment two days in a row but was told all appointments were gone. This time I lined up at the practice to get an appointment which worked.. The explanation was that they were short of doctors so the system had been changed.
Constable,Getting appointments isn't an issue,2/11/2018,5,"I've never had any problems getting appointments, it isn't an issue. The phone queue system now in place is an improvement but I don't particularly like the music that plays. Even if you call later in the morning you will get seen."
Constable,Getting through can take time,3/13/2019,4,I'm able to get appointments generally when they are needed now but getting through on the phone can take time. I would prefer to have the ability to book appointments ahead rather than being asked to call back on the day to get a routine issue sorted.
Constable,Getting through for an appointment is hard,4/19/2016,4,Care provided by the doctors has been good and we've never had a problem. At times you have to wait 45 minutes past your appointment time before going in. I spent about 40 minutes trying to get through on the phone to get an appointment this morning and this happens every time you try to see a doctor.
Constable,Getting through on phone is difficult,8/22/2016,4,"Up to now I do get appointments on the day but getting through on the phone is difficult. An appointment for a blood test in the last fortnight, has taken 2 weeks. My prescription had run out but they did make sure I had medication to cover me."
Constable,Getting through on the phone is difficult,8/13/2018,4,Getting through on the phone is the most diffcult thing. It would be good to be able to book appointmtents a few days ahead to see a doctor and can plan better.
Constable,Getting to see the GP is difficult.,9/2/2017,1,"Unpleasant and barriers put up.  The reception staff aren't at the front desk  I had a phone slammed down on me.  Getting to see the GP is very difficult. Receptionist is giving medical advice.  Basic response, complaints not really addressed.  Seeing the GP is ok"
Constable,Given an appointment 1 hour after I called,4/15/2016,5,I haven't visited the surgery for sometime but I called at 10 am this morning and was given an appointment for an hour later which was much quicker than I expected.
Constable,Gone down over the years,4/19/2016,2,The general practice has gone down over the years. Staff attitude can depend on who you see and the waiting times are not that good. Care is generally fairly good but treatment explanation is poor.
Constable,Good,12/14/2022,4,"I like that the surgery is local and close to home. Depending on the situation I either call or do an econsult. Yesterday I called and got through quickly, an appointment was arranged and treatment arranged. I used econsult and was able to get a good diagnosis through this method and it worked well. Appointments don't run to time but I understand it and it's not an issue really.  It seems outdated that everyone has to call at 8am to get an appointment."
Constable,Good,12/14/2017,4,Went to have a flu jab but was told that we no longer fitted the criteria. The letter didn't get sent either. Care of my mother has been very good though.
Constable,Good,3/30/2017,4,It is difficult to get through on the phone in the morning but normally you do get an appointment.  The waits in the surgery are okay and understandable
Constable,Good,7/3/2017,4,Still struggle to get an appointment at the surgery.  I do think we've lost the personal touch.  I'd be concerned that I wouldn't always the diagnosis given by some of the doctors
Constable,good,7/3/2019,4,"The waiting time to get an appointment on the day is difficult.  I had to call 30 times one day before getting through & being told no appt available.  The same can happen if you call back the next day.  It's not the staff's fault, it's the system in place.  I'd prefer a GP triage system to be implemented as this might help reduce delays."
Constable,good,7/3/2019,4,"Running 1/2 hour late at 9.40, wonder how they can run so late so early in the morning"
Constable,good,7/3/2019,4,The surgeries are looking a little tired.  Language is a barrier both ways at times.  I need regular blood tests as go to hospital a couple of days later but if I don't book 2-3 weeks ahead I can't guarantee getting an appointment when I need one.  They haven't replaced/covered the phlebotomist on long term sick leave.
Constable,Good but appointments hard to get and poor treatment explanations,11/13/2017,4,Treatment explanation can be lacking and getting appointments difficult
Constable,Good but not enough appointment slots,3/30/2017,4,"Doesn't appear to be enough appointment slots available so they run out by 9 am.  Appointments.  patients are told by GP they need to be seen next week but if GP doesn't book the appointment , the receptionist can't.  Increase the time the name and room appears on the screen.  It disappears too quickly"
Constable,"Good care, limited appointment slots.",11/13/2017,4,Very local.  Care and support provided is good and the call waiting system is an improvement.  There are just not enough appointments available.  Liaising between the hospital and the surgery has been a bit difficult with notes not being passed on
Constable,"Good care, very caring and supportive",3/15/2018,4,"Had quite good care, they have been very caring and supportive. It has improved and it is easier to get appointments than it was."
Constable,Good mix of appointments,7/11/2018,5,I like the mix of on the day and advanced appointments. Never had a problem getting an appointment when I've needed one.
Constable,Good nurse but GP's inconsistent,11/13/2017,4,Great practice nurse!  Doctors not consistent
Constable,good overall,7/8/2015,4,Getting appointments is very difficult & you don't get to see the same GP very often.  They seem to be firefighting all the time.  Once you see a doctor it generally works well though. The practice doesn't seem to invite patients for general health checks when they are older.  It appears that doctors spend time on other activities rather than on treatment time with patients.
Constable,Good receptionists make a difference,1/8/2017,3,"Today was good, to get an appointment however is normally more difficult. There are a couple of receptionists who are very helpful, it makes all the difference. There is one doctor, Dr xxxx, who I won't see because of the attitude they have. Being only able to discuss one issue at a time is difficult when on going condition manifests in many ways. Booking a double appointment to discuss more complicated issues is virtually impossible."
Constable,Good service all round,3/15/2018,4,"Receptionists are very helpful, the building is tidy and the doctors have been very good, they listen and give good advice. Not working makes it easier to get appointments as you can be more flexible."
Constable,Good service but appointment is difficult,3/15/2018,3,It's a local service which is good with friendly staff. Getting an appointment is very difficult. I've phoned two days running to have an appointment with a GP after being advised by the nurse. The nurse then booked me an appointment with a doctor herself. I won't see one doctor because she is so rude and has been to other members of the family. Responses are blunt and rude and I now will not see her again.
Constable,Good service. Delays for seeing Drs and nurse,12/19/2019,4,I have always managed to get an appointment to see the GP or nurse for myself and children. The receptionists are very helpful. I have had to travel to capel for some appointments rather than East Bergholt. Good quality care and treatment have consistently been given.
Constable,Good surgery on the whole,10/24/2019,3,"There is a bit of a wait at appointments but on the whole it is a good surgery. They could maybe consider clearer ways to display information posters, information is important but it can be a bit overwhelming."
Constable,Good.,3/2/2017,4,Generally quite a good surgery
Constable,GP wasted time in appointment,11/26/2015,3,"Attending a consultation with a family member the doctor spent a considerable amount of time typing the referral letter. We were then told our ""time"" was up as there were patients waiting! Surely the letter could have been typed by a secretary after the consultation."
Constable,GP's good but hard to get an appointment,3/30/2017,4,"The appointment system is difficult.  You spend a ong time calling, then when you get through the majority of the appointments are gone already.  You are sometimes offered a call back but more often told to call the next day.  What we tend to do is drive up and make an appointment as it is easier.  Seen two new GPs and they've both been good"
Constable,"Great surgery, various experiences.",11/13/2017,5,Pretty good surgery.  Treatment explanation varies depending on who you see.
Constable,Great throughout pandemic,11/8/2021,5,"The surgery has been great throughout the pandemic, I've not had a problem getting appointments even for my regular INR blood tests. I've been really happy with everything."
Constable,Had to queue but did get an appointment,3/16/2016,4,Had to queue outside at 7.50 am to get an appointment. Couldn't get an appointment yesterday with doctor who had asked me to see him again in a weeks time. I'm now waiting for my prescription at Capel but went to East Bergholt for my appointment.
Constable,Had to wait for a blood test,4/8/2017,4,I've had to wait 3 1/2 weeks for my blood test and getting appointments is a little tricky. All staff are helpful and friendly. To get a double appointment is a big issue if you need a longer one it can be a problem.
Constable,Happy with everything,2/11/2018,4,"Generally you can get appointments when they are needed. You may have to wait for a while on the phone but the new queue system is better. I'm quite happy with everything. Nurses are especially good, they are very caring and do all they can for you. The doctors are good but the 10 minutes they have with you isn't quite enough and they are pushed for time."
Constable,Happy with medical care,3/13/2019,5,Not had any problems getting an appointment but I do tend to come to the surgery to book rather than call as it is easier and you are more likely to get an appointment. The call system is much better now as it tells you where in the queue you are. I'm more than happy with the medical care provided. The pharmacy works very in East Bergholt and they liaise well with the surgery.
Constable,Happy with the service provided.,3/2/2017,5,The reception staff are superb as are the staff at the pharmacy.
Constable,Hard getting appointments and need more time with GP,3/30/2017,4,It would help to have more time when you see a doctor.  Not being able to pre-book appointments isn't great and means it;s difficult getting through first thing in the morning for an appointment that day
Constable,Hard to get appointments and waiting times can be long.,3/30/2017,2,Waiting times in the surgery can be long. Within the last 8 months it has been an hour at times.  Getting through on the phone is also an issue.
Constable,Hard to make appointments,11/13/2017,2,Difficult to make appointments.  Have to phone on the day and long wait (28 in queue at 8am!).  Drive to surgery to make appointment
Constable,Has been an improvement,4/13/2016,3,"The nurses are excellent and reception has improved. 
Waiting times are poor but I can't complain about treatment explanation. I got an appointment on the day and called at 09.30 this morning. 
Overall the experience is reasonable, it was bad but its reasonable now."
Constable,Has improved,3/13/2019,4,"Can reasonably get appointments when they are needed, I tend to book by phone and it's not a particular issue having to wait in the queue as you do get through in the end.  It would be better if pre bookable appointments were available. When you ask if a nurse could do something they just say that its not something they do. It has improved over the last 6 months but I do feel that reception should be manned at all times as  its not impossible to do and other work can take place when they are there. I have raised issues in the past but feel that they are just brushed off by management."
Constable,Has improved immeasurably.,7/3/2018,4,"All staff, both clinical and non clinical were friendly and clearly wanted to do their best to help."
Constable,Have had issues with appointment mistakes,9/4/2019,4,"I've had problems when I've arrived at the surgery only to be told I have the wrong day, luckily on one occassion I had it written on the paper to show reception. At times there are admin errors but it always seems to be the patient who gets it wrong. Care from staff though once you see them isn't bad"
Constable,Helpful and Proactive,10/8/2018,5,I can always get an appointment or speak to a doctor on the day if required.  Repeat medication always properly provided.  Helpful reception staff and kind caring nurses/doctors.  Having moved from Essex where my GP surgery was terrible this has been a really pleasant surprise.  Would recommend them!
Constable,Helpful care with limited staff,11/13/2017,3,Try hard but not enough staff.  Care is qute good when you get to see someone
Constable,Helpful staff,12/8/2021,4,"Getting through first thing in the morning on the phones can mean a long wait of up to 3/4hr. There are times where I feel a face to face appointment would be more appropriate and I feel there is a bit of a barrier to getting one. The care though is very good and the nurses are great, they've treated my husband very well over the last few weeks. The staff are all very helpful too. I can understand things have had to change at the moment and generally it works well. We were advised by a doctor to do a self referral to the hospital but when we tried the hospital informed us that the GP had to do it which was a bit frustrating."
Constable,Helpful staff,9/11/2018,5,The staff booked me a GP+ appointment at the Riverside clinic when they were unable to offer me one at the surgery. The staff are normally very helpful and I don't have any problems getting an appointment generally.
Constable,Helpful staff,9/8/2018,4,"I rarely visit but annual checks are notified on prescriptions which works well. Staff have been helpful and generally you can get an appointment when you need one,"
Constable,"Helpful, friendly staff",3/30/2017,4,"Really helpful staff.  Quite friendly, try not to make you feel awkward.  They will usually always see my child when ill but if appointments are full they will do a call back and then ask us to come in, normally straight away.  This doesn't allow you to plan."
Constable,Hospital advised I needed iron tablets but GP would not prescribe them,1/9/2016,1,Hospital advised I needed iron tablets but GP would not prescribe them.  I had another consultation at the hospital where they questioned why I hadn't been given them.  In the end it took a lot of pressure but I got them 3 weeks later
Constable,I can get appointments when I need them.,3/2/2017,4,I can get appointments when I need them and the staff are polite.  The surgery does what it's meant to do
Constable,I do struggle to get an appointment,6/15/2016,4,I do struggle to get appointments but so far I have managed to get appointments for blood tests which are regular
Constable,I like the changes to appointment system,10/24/2019,4,They do try very hard to please and are accommodating here. I like the changes to the appointments system. I am happy with this surgery.
Constable,I like the text reminder,10/24/2019,5,"I find this surgery fine and I'm fine with the new appointments system, I like the text reminder they give too. I wish that I had more time in the appointment to ask questions, I recently had an appointment but because I was only allowed to ask 2 questions I was asked to book another appointment to talk about the 3rd question. Also the booking screen does not always work."
Constable,I usually get an appointment when I need one,1/9/2016,4,"Running a bit late today.  I can usually get an appointment when I need one and getting through on the phone hasn't been too bad.  The waiting times are the only things I'd like to see improve;  other than that, everything is ok"
Constable,Improved,7/8/2015,5,"I did appreciate being added on to the end of the surgery appointments list today.  In the past it had been a bit more difficult to get appointments.
A triage system to just talk to a doctor would be beneficial and a good idea to stop unnecessary visits to the surgery.
A booking system with flexibility would be better to allow people to plan ahead.
The practice letters to the Parish Magazine are helpful & keep patients up to date with any changes happening at the surgery"
Constable,improved,7/8/2015,5,"I feel that there has been an improvement in staff attitude over the last few months.  Generally more helpful.  The reception staff cannot give out appointments.  An early or late surgery with appointments would be good for people who work.
Now staff fully understand my son's condition we get the medication and treatment needed in a timely fashion but before this it was difficult at times.
Opening some windows in the waiting room would make it a bit more pleasant for people waiting"
Constable,Improvement in how the practice operates,11/26/2015,4,"There has been an improvement in how the practice operates. About a year ago getting results was difficult. I did attend an appointment to have bloods taken, normally I have 3 lots of blood taken but the nurse only took one which I queried. A week later I had to go back for more blood to be taken."
Constable,Improvement in staff attitude,6/9/2016,3,There has been an improvement in staff attitude in the last year especially with reception staff.  The doctors have not numerically improved as much.  For me the surgery is ok but for other members of the family it has been different when trying to get medication sorted.  When a specific medication was required an alternative brand was given which was not suitable but it took 6 weeks to get this sorted.  The 2 times I have required immediate care they have been very good.
Constable,improvement needed in appointment booking,7/8/2015,4,Staff when booking appointments can be a little defensive.  The way the conversation is managed is sometimes the issue rather than not being able to get an appointment that day. The booking system does need improving but the way this is conveyed to patients is important
Constable,Improving and trying to support carers,6/18/2019,3,"Don't feel confident in the treatment for my leg as it doesn't seem to be improving.
For other areas they have been much better.
To get INR appointments has improved and staff generally are friendly and accommodating.
At the moment the service is improving.
As a carer they do take the needs we have into consideration and try to arrange hospital appointments and referrals accordingly."
Constable,Improving patient support skills,6/18/2019,2,"Customer services skills are lacking, they have problems solving issues. Being able to pre-book appointments would be better. I've been waiting a long time to get an appointment to see a nurse or a GP, but the nurses give better explanations than the doctors. It has/is steadily improving at the surgery."
Constable,Inconvenience on blood test,3/23/2018,3,Doctor asked me to have a blood test the same day I saw them but the surgery couldn't fit me in and I had to go to the riverside clinic.
Constable,Increasingly difficult,12/12/2022,3,Its becoming increasingly difficult to get appointments. Some patients have conditions that make being up at 8am very difficult but the process in place means you have to call at that time. There should be a way we are able to call later so they can pre book an appointment. The most frustrating part is when on econsult you say please don't call the mobile number as there is no reception but they then always call it and then you have the hassle of having to call the surgery to sort it all out.
Constable,Information from Drs isn't always easy to understand.,3/2/2017,4,Sometimes the information given by doctors isn't easy to understand and due to lack of time they cannot always go into the depth required.  Appointments haven't been hard to get
Constable,It has got slightly easier to get an appointment,1/9/2016,3,Getting an appointment with my GP is very difficult but it has got slightly easier to get an appointment to see any one of the doctors.  Nurses have been very good and I mainly see them.  When you can get through on the phone receptionists are great. Retinal screening - I don't feel that the screening is as good as the full optometrist screening that I had previously at a different surgery.
Constable,It has improved,12/14/2022,4,"Phone and actual appointments are difficult to get with GPs.  Mostly the phone calls do result in an appointment although there have been times they say they'll call you back in the morning and they don't, then half a day has gone and you're still waiting and no further forward.  The staff are lovely and very good with little ones, they're friendly and helpful, its just the system in place that isn't great."
Constable,It is difficult to get an appointment ahead of time,6/9/2016,3,"I received a letter inviting me to take part in a diabetic screening program because I was high risk but the surgery have never tested me for diabetes, which is strange if I am high risk.  It is difficult to get an appointment ahead of time and I do feel that it is about dealing with the one issue and then done.  Overall I'm happy with the staff and the treatment provided."
Constable,I've noticed the improvements here.,3/23/2018,5,"Feel that there has been an improvement in getting through in the morning on the 'phone and getting an appointment is much easier plus I can see the doctor of my choice. There has been an improvement in how you are dealt with by staff, no longer feel like a burden on them. Don't often wait too long. As I don't visit regularly, I can see the difference between now and a couple of years back."
Constable,Just registered at the practice,12/8/2021,5,"We've had issues registering with a practice with each one saying I was out of area but the staff here have been truly amazing, so helpful at getting us registered. They have processed everything so quickly and really helped as we were going away and had to be registered to be able to get the proof of vaccinations etc, so impressed with our first impressions of the staff."
Constable,keep assking for a copy of notes,9/4/2019,2,"A family member has been trying to get a copy of their notes for an assessment appointment but they've asked the surgery three times now and each time they go to the surgery to collect them it hasn't been done. The notes are needed an surely it can't tke too long to do, its incredibly frustrating."
Constable,Lack a bit of confidence,10/15/2021,3,I do lack a bit of confidence in the system due to my records not always being up to date. There does appear to be high turnover of staff which means you don't get to know anyone and lack continuity. Having a call back is ok but it does mean you have to wait in the whole day as you are not told when the call will happen which makes it difficult at times.
Constable,Lack of consistency,11/13/2017,2,"The only way to get an appointment is to come up to the surgery.  It's always been very difficult to get an appointment.  Rarely see the same GP so there is no continuity.  On regular occasions the prescriptions are not correct when picking them up, whether is a miscommunication or mistake."
Constable,Lack of consistency,1/9/2016,3,There is a lack of consistency with GPs especially when you are asked for a follow up appointment.  It often means starting again.
Constable,Lack of consistency frustrating,6/18/2019,2,"The explanation was not consistent when a referral to hospital done.
Not seeing the same GP meant that there was no consistency and this lead to different views of the condition being shared which was frustrating and difficult,"
Constable,Lack of team spirit impacts on surgery,1/9/2016,4,Looking at the national picture we have a lot to be thankful for.  I got through very quickly today.  However on other occasions it has not been so easy to book appointments.  The ideal would be to have better continuity of care with GPs. There appears to be a lack of team spirit which impacts on the overall running of the surgery.
Constable,Lately it has been quite good,11/26/2015,5,"In the past getting an appointment was problematic, but lately it has been quite good and it is easier to get an appointment at a suitable time."
Constable,Left with no medication,1/13/2021,1,"My partner has been chasing a ‘urgent’ prescription for the last two days only to be told by one memeber of staff that it was still not there this afternoon. After calling her colleague over they confirmed the persecution had gone over but was still not ready by the time they closed today. 

He then later found out that after being in a incredible amount of pain told by the gp to call 111 for it instead. 
He then also found out that he now has a note on his system explaining he is an ‘abusive patient’ 
Absolutely disgusting. Just because he was getting frustrated with being lied to a told different things he was not threatening at all."
Constable,Local surgery,7/27/2018,4,"Nice having a local surgery, sometimes I visit the East Bergholt surgery but normally I go to Capel."
Constable,long wait for receptionist,6/18/2019,4,I waited quite a while before the receptionist arrived even though the bell was pushed.
Constable,Long waiting time for appointment,3/15/2018,4,The length of wait for appointment is quite long especially for bloodtests where we go to the hospital now. Get the time needed in appointments.
Constable,Longer appointments would be good,7/16/2015,3,Longer appointments would be good when necessary.
Constable,Lovely receptionist and Doctor who telephoned,7/13/2020,5,Excellent response and advice. After my initial consultation my medication was waiting for me at Boots Chemist.  Thank you.
Constable,Making appointments can be difficult,11/15/2019,3,"I feel the administration is more for the patients, the making of appointments can be difficult and they have a script to follow. I would like to see more special approach for certain medical conditions."
Constable,Medical staff are quite good,3/13/2019,5,I generally use the surgery for blood tests but last time in early December the surgery was unable to do the test so I had to go up the the Riverside Clinic but this hasn't happened often. The medical staff are quite good but I have little contact with them as my consultant at the hospital is more involved.
Constable,Mixed experience of reception service,3/15/2018,5,Not having someone always on reception doesn't work and the electronic screen struggles to take the information needed. I do like being able to ask to see a specific doctor. The receptionists are very polite and helpful. The queue system on the phone allows you to know where you are and you don't have to call back.
Constable,Mixed experience overall,3/15/2018,3,"Seems to be levelling off and the phone queue system is an improvement. Doctors seem rude on the phone and will even put the phone down without saying goodbye. The reception team here are very good, really can't fault them. Could the surgery have a water machine like Capel? Dealing with any concerns, I'm happy to contact the surgery and have done in the past."
Constable,Mixed experiences,12/14/2022,1,"Calling the surgery and getting through can take time in the morning and the quality of the GPs is not good although I have just seen a new GP and they were great. They don't appear to look at your notes before seeing you even though you have to give reception an explanation of why you need the appointment.  The time you actually spend with them is really brief and there is no continuity. I have seen a good locum in the past, the nurses are amazing and reception staff are helpful."
Constable,Mixed feelings about this surgery..,3/23/2018,2,"In 2016 they removed a family member from the patient list without telling them because they didn't attend for so long. Then, due to staff training, they wouldn't see a family member so when a couple of hours later, they came back to surgery and were seen she was rushed to hospital but she had deteriorated too much and later died. She should have been seen earlier or given other options of seeing someone. This has affected how I feel about the surgery."
Constable,More advanced appointments would be good,2/11/2018,4,"No real problems. It's not too bad getting appointments but there is limited choice. The queue system on the phone this morning did take about 20 minutes to get through however, it does at least allow you to do things while you're waiting. I'm fairly happy with the care and advice given but it would be nice for more advanced appointments to be available especially for non urgent issues where you need to be able to plan more."
Constable,More advanced appointments would be good,7/11/2018,3,Not always able to get an appointment. Felt that they are slow to react with more urgent situations and it would be better to have more advanced appointments available.
Constable,Most staff friendly. Continuity of care problematic.,3/30/2017,4,Most reception staff are friendly and helpful.  It would be better if there were more continuity with the doctors rather than seeing someone different each time.  It's acceptable that there are some delays; you have to see the whole picture.  If more explanation was given it would be better and give patients reassurance as sometimes it is unclear why tests are being done.
Constable,Much improved system thankfully,10/24/2019,4,I feel the new system is much improved thankfully. I don't know why a couple of doctors have left but I do have to say that things have definitely improved here.
Constable,Name appears for too little time,9/8/2018,3,The time your name appears alongside the room number to go to appears for so little time that you can't always catch it and then you have to get someone to tell you where to go which isn't easy if reception isn't manned.
Constable,Necessary information not given,11/26/2015,3,I was told to have a blood test but the doctor did not say I needed to fast. Staff can be a little abrupt at times
Constable,Need medication review,7/13/2019,2,Review of medication was not carried out with GP I only spoke to e receptionist to inform I was unable to order some of my medications as it needed a review. After speaking to a receptionist this was then available. No review carried out by gp.
Constable,Need more time with GP and hard to get appointments,3/30/2017,4,It would help to have more time when you see a doctor.    Not being able to pre-book appointments isn't great and means it's difficult getting through first thing in the morning for an appointment that day
Constable,Need more time with the GP,3/2/2017,4,Admin staff are always cheerful and pleasant to deal with.  Some of the doctors are dismissive and it puts me off coming.  Not enough time is available for the doctors to explain fully.  The flu clinics worked well this year
Constable,Need to ask for all the information you need,1/9/2016,4,At times you do need to remember what to ask to get all the information you need.  It would be nice to have a service locally that could deal with small cuts rather than having to go to A & E for something so minor.  Overall a good surgery for me
Constable,Never had any problems,6/18/2019,5,"Absolutely spot on care provided. Nurses are great, very caring. Marvelous doctors are the same. Never had any problems at all. 
Nurses explain everything really well. I visit regularly twice a week and I have never had any issues with care or getting appointments.
Have had home visits, no problem. Quick referrals through to the hospital too. You can't do anything to improve, the service is first class. A cancellation line would help."
Constable,New system,10/24/2019,1,"This new system for appointments is ridiculous most people have to work and are not allowed phones to be used. However,I requested a phone call from doctor which I finally received after phoning at 8.45 ,at 1.05! This meant having to carry my phone everywhere with me even to the loo. Because it’s a total nightmare if you should miss that doctors call, as you have to start over again with the “sometime in the next 4 hour” phone call. However, finally spoke to doctor who booked me in for appointment later that day. Fine. When I arrived at the surgery to book myself in on the touchpad my appointment was with a nurse! Not the doctor who had arranged the appointment?? Receptionists where nowhere to be seen, as condition is ongoing with no sign of it getting better, I phoned doctor again who just said I’ll send a prescription to the chemist. Had to google it to see what it was for. This whole new system has transformed the Doctors into faceless telephonists. My thoughts were that seeing a caring doctor face to face is the right way as they are trained to spot various signs of illness. This cannot be done through a plastic handset."
Constable,New system is infinitely better now,10/24/2019,3,"The new appointment system is much better, as before it was very difficult to get an appointment, it is infinitely better now."
Constable,Next patient walked in before I had fininshed,4/20/2016,4,I was in with the doctor and he must have called the next patient because they walked in while I was still there.  It would be better if current waiting times were shown in reception on the screen.
Constable,No appointments available,1/9/2016,4,"Fairly recently I did see people queuing up outside at 8 am to get appointments.  I called yesterday for an appointment to be told none were available but that a GP could call me later in the day, which she did,  She then arranged for me to be seen today."
Constable,No call back received,1/8/2017,3,I was unable to get a appointment yesterday and was told I'd get a call back but I waited in and never got a call. Called this morning and got an appointment. Dr xxxx has refused to prescribe medication the hospital prescribed.
Constable,No complaints,12/12/2022,4,Easier to come to the surgery to book an appointment as I find speaking on the phone difficult. This morning I've been given an appointment with a GP straightaway. I find the telephone consultations very difficult too with my hearing and don't always feel they address the issues.  I don't get to see the same GP very often but I'm very happy with the treatment and care provided by all staff.
Constable,No complaints.,11/13/2017,4,Friendly and comfortable practice.
Constable,No continuity of care with doctors,1/9/2016,3,No continuity of care with doctors which means that care and advice has been different.  The standard response is to do blood tests but if these are clear then there is nothing else done.  On a couple of occasions I have had unnecessarily rude conversations with staff but on the whole the staff aren't bad.
Constable,No problems getting appointments.,3/2/2017,5,We've had no problems getting appointments for all the family.  It's a convenient location and we are happy to attend either surgery
Constable,No problems getting INR appointments,12/8/2021,4,For me the triage system works well and you get an appointment when you need one. I've had no problems getting my regular INR appointments either. Staff are all good and I don't have any issues with the practice.
Constable,No temperature checks?????????,8/17/2020,2,"Had appointment for blood pressure check recently and that part went fine. However, asked for a temperature check too as my home thermometer never appears to be accurate.
Nurse did NOT have means to do this and says could not access store cupboard. She suggested I ask at reception who should be able to find someone and this I did.

However, and I still cannot believe this,  I was told that there was no one around who could do this and so I left in disgust at  such as poor service.

At this time with Covid 19 raging I cannot believe it was not possible to have a simple temperature check and  so must question why was this and how could this be."
Constable,Normally quite kind and attentive until today,4/25/2019,3,"Rung up this morning to speed up an important prescription but because I need it earlier then they expected I am questioned with a rude manner, never heard of the lady who responded before do not appreciate that type of service being in a service industry myself"
Constable,"normally run behind, cant book in advance",7/4/2017,3,Waiting times for appointments are quite long at times.  Normally runs behind.  I don't like that you can't book in advance which makes it difficult for work
Constable,Not always good attitudes,8/13/2018,3,Managed to get an appointment with out too much trouble this morning. Previously I've had poor attitude from doctors which puts me off coming.
Constable,Not easy to get appointment but good service,3/15/2018,3,Not always easy to get appointments especially with specific doctors as I get good follow-up and continuity with my condition is very important to me. The locum I see is very thorough and checks everything. very happy to wait if doctor needs longer with another patient. Personally never had a problem.
Constable,Not told about cancelled appointment,6/12/2018,1,"My granddaughter had an appointment for lung function test. Took her out of high school early and arrived at East Bergholt. As we were unable to book in electronically, I spoke to a member of staff who told us we had been booked in and to take a seat and wait. After 35 mins of waiting I returned to the desk and queried the delay only to be told the staff member who carries out the tests was away and all appointments cancelled and I should have received a message. I was extremely unhappy that 1. I did not receive any message, 2. That a member of staff booked us in and told us to wait, even if she had only just arrived and hadn't been told, this was extremely bad communication and 3. the fact that my granddaughter had to miss lessons at an important time for no reason - she has exams next week-. Every time I visit the surgery there is information on how many patients fail to turn up for appointments, how about how many patients waste their time turning up for cancelled appointments."
Constable,Nurses are brilliant,4/21/2016,1,"Getting through on the phone is very difficult I tried for 20 minutes then gave up for a while but then later got through. It would be better to have early and late surgery times too, especially for people who work. The nurses are really brilliant, excellent but some of the doctors don't face you in appointments. The locum today was really fabulous, would see him again."
Constable,"Nurses are lovely, text reminders work",6/18/2019,5,"The nurses are lovely. The nurse practitioners are great and they treat patients brilliantly, they will refer to a doctor if needed which works well. 
The text reminders are wonderful.
The surgery at Capel is small and does struggle with the facilities available - parking especially.
The pharmacy at Capel does face more difficulties and get prescriptions filled is slow and they don't seem to be able to cope with the demand, the pharmacy at East Bergholt is much better and quicker to get medications through."
Constable,Nurses are very good,7/27/2018,3,"Normally you can get appointments, theres a doctor I don't like to see but the rest are good and the nurses are very good, they are friendly and approachable and less intimidating. I phoned today and was given an appointment straight away."
Constable,Nurses explain things very well,10/8/2015,3,"The nurses explain things very well but the doctors don't as well as they tend to skip over things. The reception staff are good and are often in a difficult position. It seems that doctors rather than staggering their time off tend to take it off at the same time. 

Appointments are difficult to get the phone is always engaged so use redial for at least 10 mins. A call waiting system would be good to tell you where you are in the queue. Late evening appts for those who work would be beneficial with afternoons reserved for older people. I don't mind the on the day booking but pre booking appointments would be useful. The practise has had to use locums a lot but they don't seem to care as much as permanent staff. I would prefer to see the same doctor if possible but understand that it is not always possible. It appears that maybe the surgery is not moving with the times and meeting patients expecting"
Constable,Ok getting appointments but need more slots,4/4/2017,3,Getting through on the phone is difficult but when you do you generally get an appointment.  It would be good to have more advance appointments available to help maintain continuity
Constable,Okay when you can actually get appointment,7/4/2017,3,"It's ok when you can actually get through, but it took 22 minutes to get through and then there are normally no appointments available.  Today was different"
Constable,On the day appointments aren't helpful,6/18/2019,4,Very good and efficient and got me sorted very quickly the last time I came in. Staff were helpful. The only issue I have is being able to get to the surgery. I have no transport and the on the day system makes it difficult to get an appointment around having transport as you can't plan.
Constable,On the day only appointments isn't great,6/18/2019,4,"I would rather be able to plan ahead for appointments, not calling in the morning of the day to see what's available. I've never been turned away and told there are no appointments available.
You don't get to see the same doctor, you just see whoever is available on the day, which I don't think is as good."
Constable,One size doesn't fit all,11/8/2021,3,I feel that at times there is limited flexibility in the system and one size does not always fit all. Having underlying health conditions I tried to get a face to face appointment for something on the face of it is fairly innocuous but with my conditions could become serious but was told by a doctor it wasn't necessary. However when I did see another health professional for one of my conditions they asked why I hadn't had the issue looked at. I just feel that each case should be looked at individually but that professionals also need to listen to patients too. Other than this the care is normally good and I've felt supported.
Constable,One star is too much!,7/13/2019,1,"A complete shambolic service which is getting worse by the minute.
The appointment system was unacceptable and the new system is even worse! 
Who, in the working world has time or the freedom to be called back later in the day, not me for sure. 
If I’m ill I need to see someone speedily and determine my ability to work and recover for whatever it is that is ailing me!"
Constable,Online booking doesn't work,2/11/2018,5,"Its difficult to get an appointment, so I come to the surgery to get them now. The online booking is pointless as appointments aren't available whenever you go on the system. Care from doctors and nurses has been excellent, more permanent doctors would help and medical staff generally are required. Would prefer that the bell only sounded when a patient was being called as it is confusing. The reception bell now means you keep looking up thinking you're being called by the doctor."
Constable,Online system doesn't have appointments,4/20/2016,3,It can take time to get through in the mornings. I used to be able to book online but this doesn't seem to have any appointments available. I'd prefer to use it as getting everything ready in the morning plus trying to get through on the phone is difficult.  There are a lot of locums used which does affect the continuity of care I receive.
Constable,Overall a good surgery,6/18/2019,4,Booking appointments 'on the day only' can be frustrating. Prescriptions are often not ready on time. But overall a good surgery
Constable,Overall an excellent service,4/20/2016,4,Overall its an excellent service and they do cover a large area. The site is much better than the old building and much better organised. To book an appointment is difficult and the advanced appointment system is unclear and be explained better.
Constable,Parking is good,10/24/2019,3,I do hope the new system works well. Its nice to have the background music playing. The parking at East Bergholt is good.
Constable,People not attending should be charged,11/26/2015,3,"Charge people for missed appointments, the dentist does so why can't you.
I am fed up with trying to get an appointment maybe once or twice a year, to then sit and see on the screen that 37 (this was last time) people hadn't bothered to turn up, in the last week!!"
Constable,Phones are busy,2/3/2022,4,The phones are busy which is a bit frustrating and I would like to see a return to more face to face appointments but the staff are very pleasant  and all so lovely.  I do feel a referral has been delayed and wasn't done when I was told it would be.  I'm under the care of a consultant at west Suffolk hospital and I have to get a hard copy of results etc and send it to the hospital myself as the practice can't be sent electronically for some reason.
Constable,Phones are busy,1/3/2022,4,It takes time to get through on the phone but staff are helpful when you do speak to them. I find having a phone consultation more difficult as you don't get to see someone face to face and I find explaining things on the phone difficult.
Constable,Pleased with the care.,11/13/2017,4,Generally the care is good.  Staff are caring.  A little difficult to get an appointment on the day.
Constable,Polite staff,1/3/2022,5,"I'm happy with how the system is working, I'm able to get appointments in the format I've wanted as when I've needed them. The staff are polite and efficient and I've found that the econsult system that's on the website has worked very well too and gets issues addressed quickly."
Constable,Polite staff good communication & effective,10/1/2019,5,Visit for smear test. Was made to feel at ease and confident in nurse. Listening to me important. Knew my background. Really rate feeling that I was important.
Constable,Poor,3/30/2017,1,I'm no longer a patient here as we decided last year it would be best to change surgeries as we were not happy with the surgery or how some doctors were with us
Constable,Poor,8/12/2016,1,"I attended an appointment for a general health check.  Prior to interview I sustained a hand and wrist injury falling off my bike, I asked the nurse if she could look at it for me.  She replied that she did not have time for that, she had other patients to see.(The waiting room was empty.)  She also stated to come back and see the doctor in a month.  My hand was badly swollen and bruised.  I feel that I was not afforded respect and professional standards were not applied in this case."
Constable,poor,9/30/2019,2,Continuity of care needs to be improved.  In Suffolk warfarin tests happen with full blood tests at the Riverside Clinic as the phlebotomist at Constable Country is on long term sick leave.  In Essex they use a pin prick test which is far easier and less invasive & much quicker
Constable,poor,9/30/2019,2,"At times it feels you are being rushed through and that you are not being listened to at all.  The nurses have been very good because they listen, are friendly and are patient orientated.  I'd like them to improve the appointment system"
Constable,poor,9/30/2019,2,"Lack of continuity of care. New doctor every time doesn't know about me.  Having to repeat what drugs I am on each time. After shoulder injury, dr. read through discharge summary but didn't understand how to transfer information into my notes"
Constable,poor,9/30/2019,1,You can't make advanced appts. even when the consultant at the hospital has asked you to see them by a certain date.
Constable,poor,9/30/2019,1,Getting an apt is very difficult.  If you can get through on the phone around 8 am you will get an appt. but you never get to see the same doctor.  It would be nice to get to know your doctor
Constable,Poor - all round,1/11/2016,1,"Long waits, locum GPs, don't answer phone.  Not great follow up, etc. etc"
Constable,Poor - cannot combine appointments,3/30/2017,2,Two tests need doing but the surgery has been unable to combine these appointments and two visits to the surgery are now required which isn't ideal
Constable,Poor - long waits poor communication,10/11/2016,1,"Long waits, locum GPs,  don't answer phones, not great follow up,  etc. etc. !"
Constable,Poor adminstration and timekeeping,7/8/2015,1,"I booked an appointment to see the GP after being called by reception following a test.  When I had the appointment there were no notes on the system so the GP asked me to come back a week later.

There is often miscommunication and different staff tell you different information about situations that are taking place. The appointment system is better recently. Not having continuity of care has actually impacted on the trestment in the past. I feel it is important to have continuity.
Reception staff will often want to know full details of why you need an appointment which is not always appropriate.  It seems that you won't get an appointment if you don't say.

Parents can often struggle to get an appointment on the day, especially if you are getting children ready for school because phoning has to be done early in the morning.  Pre-booking, even just the day before, would enable families to plan.  I've been told by staff to get to the surgery for a certain time or I would miss my appointment but even first thing in the morning they are already running late."
Constable,Poor and Rude,8/21/2015,1,Today I popped into the surgery at 810am just to ask a quick question.  The surgery was empty and there where members of staff chatting when I said excuse me I was totally ignored. When I asked for help they carried on talking and googling and went into the office.  Leaving me there.  I had to ring the bell to get some assistance to be told oh I thought you where checking in on the screen.  My query di not get sorted out because it was only a 2 minute question I wanted to ask a nurse.  I was offered an appointment which was totally not necessary.  Funny how they can blatantly stand and chat and giggle but not give a patient 2 minutes of their time.
Constable,Poor continuity and not 'joined up',6/18/2019,3,"GPs chop and change, not much continuity of care. Ineffective management of surgery. I feel that they can't seem to make clear decisions. Pre-booking of appointments is not possible, you have to ring up in the morning. Services do not seem to be joined up. However, the nurse practitioners are good."
Constable,Poor experience,9/11/2017,1,Went to the surgery for an appointment to see a doctor. I was told no appointments were available. I was very unwell and a nurse who was visiting as a patient called 999 and assisted me until the ambulance arrived.
Constable,Poor on many issues.,11/13/2017,2,"Doctors always running late. Locums seem better at explaining and listening.  Receptionists: some really helpful but generally better in Capel. However, letter from hospital unopened for 8 month.  Generally poor admin.  Difficult to make appointments.  Sometimes try queuing outside to avoid telephone wait."
Constable,Poor service and attitude,3/30/2017,2,"Doctors don't seem to want to listen to you and appointments are rushed.  They don't seem to want to help a lot of the time.  After speaking to the doctor on duty I was told I couldn't have any more medication.  I then booked to see another GP and they prescribed the medication straight away.
I visited the surgery with a bleeding arm but when I asked if a nurse could dress it I was told no nurses  were on duty and I'd have to go to A & E"
Constable,"Poor, short staffed.",4/5/2017,1,I took a urine test into the surgery at 9.10 am for it to be dipped by a nurse. She immediately told me there was an infection.  My mother (who this was for) suffers dementia.  As I look after her I needed a prescription asap.  The prescription should be sent to our local surgery.  I was still begging for this at 5 pm.  I needed to start the medication!!!  Short staffed!  Not my problem!
Constable,"Poor. Hard getting appointments, doctor rude, nurses brilliant",3/30/2017,1,"Getting an appointment - lack of continuity and doctor can be arrogant and rude.  I have complained in the past but have had no response.  The nurses here are brilliant; very good with the children, they were prepared to listen"
Constable,Poor. Hard to see GP but they are very good,3/30/2017,2,Trying to see a doctor is difficult.  I need to see a GP but have to see a nurse as none available.  When you do get to see someone they are very good.
Constable,"Poor. Long waiting times, can't get appointments & variable staff attitudes",11/13/2017,2,Waiting times poor. Difficult to get appointments but tend to be better with children.  Variable staff attitudes.  Friends have moved to other surgeries.
Constable,Practice is limited for dementia support,10/12/2017,4,"Hands are tied, professionals are unable to support families where an individual has dementia. There seems very little they can actually give to people."
Constable,Prefer the phone queue system,2/11/2018,5,Got an appointment this morning and I prefer the queue system on the phone to my last surgery.
Constable,Pretty good,10/15/2021,4,"I don't visit often but I have felt that it is a bit more difficult to get a face to face appointment however, when I spoke to a GP they did agree to see me. I do like that the preventative things like flu vaccinations and shingles jabs have all been offered. The covid vaccination sessions run by the surgery have all gone well too and included a health check  which was great."
Constable,Problems making appointments,7/8/2015,2,"Trying to get through on the phone at 8 am is very difficult. you can't get through quickly.  For ou can turn up at 4.30 to be fitted in.  
I did ask to see a doctor today but have been given an appointment with the nurse when I would've preferred to see the doctor.
Non-urgent appointments it would help to have pre-bookable appointments available.
Having a drop-in style surgery would help patients to see a doctor when they need to but I do think that if you have an emergency.  I've had very good treatment from the nurses at the surgery for a number of different issues.  They have been great"
Constable,Quite accomodating,2/11/2018,4,Staff are quite accommodating. Normally phone for appointments and generally get one on the day. It would be nice to be able to book appointments ahead to allow you to plan. The staff are friendly and doctors explain things well.
Constable,Really great,10/15/2021,5,My husband had an issue and staff were really great at sorting out everything. The triage system has worked well however when you have questions they have to go through the reception staff which means only one thing at a time gets answered so it makes getting the information more drawn out as they have to go back to the doctor if you then have a follow up question. I haven't had any issues getting through on the phone and can't fault the staff they are all very good. The covid vaccination process was very good and efficient.
Constable,Really struggle,8/13/2018,2,Really struggle to get appointments at the surgery. There are long queues on the phone which is frustrating. I don't like being asked the reason for the appointment and at times reception staff can be a bit curt and unfriendly.
Constable,Really very good,12/12/2022,4,I saw a trainee last time but I saw them 50 minutes after my appointment time and that was a long time with a young baby. There are a limited number of appointments available at the Capel surgery which is difficult for patients.  It would be great if the car park spaces could be made bigger or to have some allocated children spaces as getting a baby car seat out is very difficult.  I didn't feel the 6 week check for my baby was very thorough and mine was even more limited so I actually booked another appointment with a female doctor as soon as I came out. It was done in a much better way and I was really reassured and was confident with the GP.  Appointments have been fine to get.
Constable,Recent improvement,7/8/2015,4,Staff are helpful and we have noticed improvements recently. Recently had about a 5 day delay with medication changes after the hospital revised the medicition I should be on.  The GP sorted this out the next time I visited but I was on the wrong medication for a few days. Getting appointments has improved. You can now get through on the phones.  Yesterday I called and got an appointment and I'm back today. The nurses have been really good and I get to see them whenever I need to.
Constable,Recently improved,11/20/2015,3,"Been an improvement in how I'm received at the surgery, great"
Constable,Reception are good,1/3/2022,5,No problems getting appointments by phone it all works well. I have regular blood tests and the appointments are easy and quick to arrange. The reception staff are helpful and very good and addressing issues.
Constable,Reception are helpful,1/3/2022,5,I called the surgery and was given an appointment straightaway by reception who were nice and helpful. I've had appointments with the nurse and a paramedic and from today's experience  I've been very happy with how it's gone.
Constable,Reception staff have been fantastic,4/15/2016,3,"Reception staff have been fantastic, very helpful and pleasant and do their best. Nurses are excellent too. GP communication skills are a little lacking at times. They can rush you through and don't listen to what you are saying. Also at times the doctor talks to me rather than my father.  I'd like to see better patient care, I've tried to book a double appointment in the past but this is very difficult. I was previously prescribed the wrong medication which was picked up when I had a bleed. The medication was then changed by a different doctor who was fantastic but as they were a locum they didn't stay."
Constable,Receptionists nice and helpful,7/11/2018,5,"Receptionists are nice and helpful, the nurses are great as they explain things well. I would prefer to be able to book appointments with the same people. The door through to the treatment rooms is very heavy and difficult to open, especially if you use a frame."
Constable,Recognise that staff are under pressure,4/21/2016,4,When you have an appointment the experience is good. I recognise staff are under pressure but staff are trying to deliver. There are not enough doctors and appointments. You have to queue from 7.30 am to guarantee an appointment and there appears not to be enough staff at the surgery.
Constable,Rude abd abrupt.,9/2/2017,2,"Staff have been rude and abrupt with me.
Not having continuity with doctors has impacted on the care I've received.  It would be better to see the same doctor more regularly.  Understanding what is being explained can be difficult and language is an issue at times. Nurses have been absolutely fabulous.  I've been trying to see a specific doctor since October with no success."
Constable,See different doctors,1/8/2017,2,"The biggest problem is the number of new doctors/locums you see, which means lengthy explanations of complex history. We've seen four different doctors recently and the hospital picked up that one medication should not have been taken long term, even though this was how the surgery prescribed it."
Constable,See different people,9/11/2018,3,"You get mixed messages from the doctors as you see so many different people and they say different things and prescribe different medications, so you don't get to the bottom of things."
Constable,see same gp,3/13/2019,5,To make an appointment you do have to call first thing and it can take 10 minutes to get through. I like the queue system on the phone but sometimes it would be better to not know where you are and may be they could explain to patients how many lines are answered and how long on average it takes to get through. There is little explanation about why or how things operate at the surgery and it would help patients to understand and access services better if it was explained. I tend to see the same gp and like the continuity.
Constable,Seeing a specific dr. is difficult.,9/2/2017,2,Getting an appointment and to see the doctor of your choice is very difficult.  There is no continuity of care  Ringing on the day is difficult so coming to the surgery is easier.  Being able to drive makes accessing appointments at either surgery ok.
Constable,Seen a good dr recently,7/27/2018,3,Care hasn't always been great but I've seen a good doctor recently. I don't like that the reception area isn't manned and its difficult to get the attention of staff out the back.
Constable,Seen quickly,2/3/2022,5,"I've had no problem getting appointments and I've been seen very quickly and then referred on to hospital with in 2 weeks. The surgery have been amazing, offering lots of support and called me to arrange a post operative wound check."
Constable,Service has been good,1/9/2016,5,"Rarely visit but when I do the service has been good.  Waiting times can be a little long but it depends if another patient needs more time.  You do need to be a little proactive by asking questions but generally staff explain things well.
The change in the way prescriptions are managed has made it more complicated  even though I can drive .  It is difficult to get my prescription to the surgery again before it can be prescibed"
Constable,Sometimes short waits but generally not too bad,1/9/2016,5,"Always been pleasant.  Sometimes short waits but generally not too bad.  When I visit, the service I receive meets my needs."
Constable,Staff and treatment good,2/3/2022,4,The phones are very busy in the mornings especially so it can take time to get through. When I've been in the surgery it is frustrating that when reception are trying to book an appointment for me the time they are offering gets snapped up by someone else booking appointments. Once you do get an appointment the staff and treatment are good.
Constable,Staff are friendly,2/11/2018,5,"Never had a problem, staff are friendly and I like that I can request a call back rather than having an appointment. Generally I'm confident in the staff. Getting through on the phone can take some time"
Constable,Staff are good,12/12/2022,3,Pre booked appointments with the nurse was booked last week and I was able to make the one I was offered. The phones are very busy with long waits but the staff are good and having two practices works quite well too
Constable,Staff are good,2/3/2022,4,"It's pretty good getting appointments, today's appointment was a prebooked blood test and I don't have any issues getting them on a regular basis. The staff are good and explain things well."
Constable,"staff are helpful, no problems getting appointments",7/4/2017,5,"New, Clean.  Staff are very helpful.  Can always get the information neede.  No problems getting appointments and can go to either surgery"
Constable,Staff are very polite and kind,10/24/2019,4,The staff and reception staff are very polite and kind. I understand why the new call back system is in place but it can be a bit cumbersome for the patient. It is a good surgery though.
Constable,Staff have been exceptional,11/26/2015,4,The staff have been exceptional as they've helped get appointments arranged when needed urgently and for specific reasons.  there can sometimes be waits for your appointment but if this is due to emergencies or other patients needing more time this is understandable.
Constable,Staff have been under enormous pressure,6/17/2016,4,"Last year the service wasn't very good as you could never get an appointment, it has  improved. I don't have total faith in the doctors, some of it is because of attitude and the wishy washy approach they take. They ask you as the patient what needs doing but you're there because you need their advice.  Because of the situation with in the surgery staff have been under enormous pressure and have remained professional.  If someone needs longer in an appointment I'm happy to wait if I'm going to be given the same when I need it."
Constable,Staff have been very helpful on my visits,8/2/2022,5,Punctual appointments & friendly professional staff.
Constable,Staff not on reception and lack of equipment,3/30/2017,1,No one is on reception when people arrive and you often have to wait for a receptionist to come through. I also had problems getting the right equipment to do a test that the hospital wanted me to have.  The equipment was broken and initially I was told that it wasn't something they did.
Constable,Staff very pleasant & professional but sometime hard to get appointments,3/30/2017,4,Calling first thing means the phones are very busy but if you call later all appointments for the day are gone.  Like the friendliness and professionalism of staff.  All very pleasant
Constable,Surgery works well,11/8/2021,4,"I find the surgery good and have always got a same day appointment when I've needed one. The triage system also works well for me, the only thing is that I'd like to be able to see one doctor as at times seeing different doctors for the same issue means you get told to do different things as they have different approaches."
Constable,Terrible.,5/27/2020,1,"My mother was issued a prescription for oral morphine after breaking her ankle and foot. When I tried to collect this from Capel, I was told that the Dr had not signed the prescription. The second time I went round to collect this, I was told the prescription was at east Bergholt, which I agreed to collect. On my way to east Bergholt I was called to say it was now at Capel surgery. My mum has had to wait 8 hours for her morphine and has been in agony. When I asked for a complaint form, on my third trip round the pharmacy, I was told they didn’t have any and advised to write a letter. Fortunately for my mother she has family to support her. If she had not, she would have been left in considerable pain which would have no doubt resulted in an ambulance and hospital admission during a global pandemic. Absolutely disgusting service, poor communication between surgery’s and terrible practice from a registered GP."
Constable,Text reminders great,10/15/2021,5,The text message reminders sent by the practice are great and both the flu and covid vaccination clinics  have gone really smoothly with the booking system simple. Each was well organised and staff great.
Constable,The appointment system seems quite complicated.,9/2/2017,3,The appointment system seems quite complicated.  When I called initially for a pre-planned appointment none were available but then one was found. You can't always be available to ring at 8 am.  It would be good to have greater flexibility to book advanced appointments.  When calling they sometimes come across as a little unhelpful
Constable,The new prescription process is long.,9/2/2017,4,"The new prescription process is quite long and drawn out.
To pick up medication can take 6 days for it to be ready.
Bit of a delay for blood tests at the surgery.  Can be a little tricky to get an appointment to see a GP and you don't get to see the same doctor all the time."
Constable,The nurses are very good.,4/19/2016,4,The nurses are very good. You can't always see the doctor you want but you do get an appointment. The only issue with that is that the doctor doesn't know your history.  Sometimes the waits can be quite long but this isn't on every visit. I have a pre booked appointment for next Monday and it was no problem to get.
Constable,There seems to be absolutely no continuity,11/14/2020,1,"Very poor service for the following reasons, can never get an appointment, never able to see the same doctor, doctors knowledge of my condition is very poor, access to my medical records is too time consuming, test results have to be searched in 60 day blocks so looking for test that were carried out a few years ago becomes an impossible task!"
Constable,They cannot do enough for you,5/1/2017,5,They cannot do enough for you.  They bring my medication to my home for me for which I am very grateful as I cannot get out a lot - no transport.  Thank you all
Constable,They do try to see you if you need,6/18/2019,4,"They do try to accommodate you and get you an appointment, even if it's not with a GP.
When you ring at 8am you do have to wait on the phone for a long time, 20 minutes, and have been cut off when 2nd only to rejoin the queue at 27th.
High turn over of staff which means you see different people all the time and when you find a good doctor they then leave.
Don't tend to know what the doctors specialisms are."
Constable,They have improved. Very helpful & supportive,3/15/2018,4,"They have improved, they have really bent over backwards to help us with our situation. It's nice to see the improvement. having the clinical pharmacist at the surgery has been great, very helpful and supportive."
Constable,They have too many patients,2/18/2020,1,"They do not have the number of doctors to deal with patients, the telephone appointment service is not suitable for those who work, you do not always have to be bedridden to the ill enough to see a doctor!"
Constable,This Practice has been brilliant recently.,11/14/2020,5,"I filled out three e forms on three separate occasions.  GPs rang me extremely promptly and were very helpful.  Also had three telephone appointments and same again, GPs rang me very promptly and were very thorough and helpful.  Reassuring in these difficult times to get prompt help."
Constable,Told to come back to see them but can't,9/4/2019,3,You don't get to see the same GP. When you see someone they say to come back and see them in so many weeks but when you try and book you can't and have to call on the day and then you can't see who you want to see. If  the doctor wants to see you they need to book you in or change what they say to patients.
Constable,Treatment explanation can be lacking,11/26/2015,3,Couple of GP's not good at treatment explanation and very dismissive.
Constable,Treatment of Injury to finger.,6/30/2020,5,"An injury to one of my fingers necessitated repeated dressing by the team of  nurses  at East  Bergholt over a period of seven weeks.    The team is a tribute to the practice, each member showing great care,  compassion and professionalism .   I am so grateful and can't thank them enough.."
Constable,triage system works well,7/4/2017,5,Generally just come for my annual check up which works well but if you need a blood test it can take longer to get an appointment.  The triage system worked well today.  After speaking to the doctor I was given a morning appointment
Constable,Unable to make appointment,6/11/2020,1,"I was advised after consultation of 111 doctor to make a follow up appointment with my GP.
There is no way of doing this without visiting East Bergholt surgery in person which we are clearly told not to do."
Constable,Understaffed,12/5/2016,3,Understaffed and lacking the highest standard.
Constable,Unhappy with appointments system +leadership,7/8/2015,4,"Generally by queuing we do get to see the doctor of our choice. To help with  continuity of care pre-bookable appointments would be good. If we needed an appointment on the day we're sure we would actually get to see the doctor if busy. Sometimes it feels that Capel doesn't always get the same service as that available at East Bergholt Surgery.  Seeing the same doctor when you have an ongoing issue would be better.  You do need continuity otherwise most of the 10 minutes you're allowed are taken up with explaining the problem and you are unable to get to the new problem.
The leadership of the practice seems to be an issue; a lot of the problems come from there."
Constable,Unprofessional,5/8/2020,1,"My daughter who has shielded for 19 wks & wound to her leg that needed to be seen within 24hrs , advised from a & e . 
Dr’s not willing to see her wound to check no signs of infection , myself advising she is high risk health wise !  No nurse free to see her either . Told that I had to wait another 24hrs to be seen ! So a worrying night deciding how her leaking wound may become infected ."
Constable,used e consult,7/25/2022,5,used e-consult to describe symptoms late in the evening. GP rang me the next morning (ie within 12 hrs) to discuss further and prescribe treatment
Constable,Very good,12/14/2022,4,"No issues getting appointments when I've needed them and I call which doesn't take too long either. I like that you get the text reminder about appointments as it is useful. The staff are friendly, it was good when you did see the doctor more often but that aspect isn't as easy any more. Reception staff are friendly and helpful and I like that I can attend either of the surgery sites."
Constable,Very good doctors surgery,1/17/2023,5,Called Monday in the morning and got through on the phones in less than 10 minute which seems to be a big improvement recently.the staff on reception are very helpful and friendly. Doctor sent my prescription to pharmacy straight away.  Nothing to groan about
Constable,Very good in general,3/30/2017,5,"In general it's been very good.  Staff are magnificent and often go the extra mile; they are very willing to help.  Can get appointments on the day.  Patient care is very good but the wider experience is not so good.  More feedback to patients needed.  ""You said - we did"" board"
Constable,Very good service,3/30/2017,5,Very good service considering the number of people who need to be seen
Constable,Very happy with service,3/3/2021,5,"Promptly seen by a nurse practitioner who was knowledgeable, efficient and kind."
Constable,Very pleased with the service,1/9/2016,4,Very pleased with the service. I've always managed to get an appointment when I need one.  They always try to squeeze you in.
Constable,Very poor prescription service,12/14/2016,1,"Put prescription request into surgery 12/10/16 as they are so inefficient that they now say they need 7 working days to sign a repeat script.  In my opinion this pathetic.  Sorry !  Asked for said script to be delivered to East Bergholt chemist.  Went to collect script on 21/10/2016 and was told it was no through yet.  They showed me their system and indeed no sign of script.  Surgery claim they sent it but no evidence to prove it.  Happens all the time.  On this day another patient had exactly the same experience,   Yet another sad tale of failure of this grossly underperforming practice at every level"
Constable,Very poor.,11/13/2017,2,Nothing good!  Used for years and currently at its worst.  High turnover of doctors - no continuity.  Mis-diagnosing by locum doctors - identified by hospital.  Difficult to get appointments and reception often not attended.  Staff on computers in back office. Practice Manager rarely available if problem
Constable,Wait up to 45 mins with small child,10/24/2019,3,"I do have to wait for a while before being called in, I have had to wait up to 45 mins and with a small child can be frustrating in the waiting area. But otherwise no concerns about this surgery."
Constable,Waiting times are quite good,4/15/2016,4,"Waiting times are quite good, you can't expect not to have any delays."
Constable,Waiting times have been ok.,1/9/2016,5,Very nice and helpful.  Waiting times have been ok.  I always book by phone and have not had any problems.
Constable,Where to start,12/20/2019,1,"Call back system is a ridiculous time waster for patients and no doubt GP’s - don’t bother with the EConsult took two days over the time “limit” to receive a missed call...
Looks like I’ve lost the postcode health lottery - considering relocating to have a competent doctors surgery...."
Constable,Why can't the toilet seat be repaired?,10/24/2019,4,"Its a good surgery but why can't the toilet seat be repaired in the ladies, its been loose for months!"
Constable,Wonderful Nurses,11/13/2017,4,The nurses are brilliant.  They regularly dress a wound for me.  Nurses are really good but don't see the doctors very often.
Constable,Wonderful when you get here,12/12/2022,4,Getting through on the phone can mean a long wait. When I was 6th in line it took 1/2hr to speak to someone and that was later in the day . The staff are very good and really once you talk to a GP and then get invited in to see them it works really well.
Constable,Works well,12/8/2021,4,The triage system works well for me as and when I need an appointment. I've had no particular issues but do worry that not having face to face appointments as often may mean issues are potentially missed.
Constable,Worse practice ever,6/4/2021,1,"I have never come across such uncaring, difficult and rude doctors.  Everything at this surgery takes for ever even trying to get through on the phone and you are constantly having hurdles thrown in the way. In can takes over a week just to get a medication review even if you have no meds and they are needed urgently.  I have absolutely no faith in this practice.  Look elsewhere for your GP if you can."
Constable,Would like more hospitality from staff,3/23/2018,4,Generally good to get appointments. Staff are usually helpful but could be more accommodating at times and less abrupt. Getting blood tests is normally ok when having at the surgery.
Constable,Would like to see a permanent doctor,2/11/2018,4,I haven't had any problems really. I would prefer more continuity with a permanent doctor as you do see a lot of locums. I tend to visit the surgery to make my appointments rather than calling as it's easier to get an appointment that way.
Constable,You can get appointments.,3/2/2017,4,"You do need to book a month ahead to have your ears done, whereas you previously could book 4 -5 days ahead. Can get appointments when I need them"
Constable2,10 minute appointments can be an issue,3/17/2016,4,10 minute appointments can be an issue. The flu clinics should use the village hall. No problems
Constable2,2 star,6/18/2015,2,2 star
Constable2,3 doctors refused to do a home visit,10/23/2019,1,"Dementia patient in desperate need for a visit to be made comfortable in her last stage. 3 dr refused to visit finally got one out who didn’t even take temp and couldn’t see the problem with the green discharge from a infection I had to remind her of her duty of care 
Would have been better calling out a vet"
Constable2,3 stars,11/20/2015,3,3 Stars
Constable2,3 Things,7/14/2015,2,"Medication - Doctor prescribed an additional drug without a medication review only the pharmacist picked it up + queried it with me. The practice did apologise.

Lost Letter - My husband needed an operation at his dentists but due to his medication it needed to be amended to prevent too much bleeding and this needed to be okayed by his doctor. We wrote to the practice in May, had to send a second letter in 6 after the first was lost, the letter was sent back to the dentist and another letter was sent in reference to the first letter that was lost. The whole process took 1 1/2 months.

Queue - (sometimes there has been 16 people in the queue). As a carer getting to the surgery to an appointment is very difficult first thing in the morning but getting through on the phone is impossible if you need an appointment on the same day. You can't pre book appointments which is frustrating."

Constable2,A bit easier to get appointments,9/8/2018,3,"It is difficult to get an appointment, in the past it has been a two week wait but at the moment it is slightly easier. Receptionist are very helpful but because you don't see the same doctor each time you have to explain yourself and the situation each time you visit. Even early appointments can run behind by nearly an hour. We were told after about 1/2 hr there would be a wait. It can be confusing when doctors explain things as they can often say different things or contradict each other."
Constable2,A friendly surgery,10/24/2019,3,"Its a friendly surgery, on the whole referrals are good, I am just concerned about the expansion of the village and how will the surgery cope with more residents?"
Constable2,Able to get on the day appointments,3/16/2016,3,"The last three times I've been to the surgery I've been able to get an appointment on the day. The doctors do not give a lot of eye contact because they are either reading your notes or writing up what you are saying. Continuity, although not good has not impacted on my care."
Constable2,Advance appointments limited,12/4/2018,3,The number of advanced bookings are very limited. It doesn't sit well to call on the day for non urgent matters. On occasions there is not enough seating in the waiting room and people have to stand.
Constable2,All options available.,11/13/2017,4,Can get appointments either by phone or at the surgery;  it works quite well.
Constable2,Another patient came in to the treatment room,11/20/2015,3,"When I had an appointment with the nurse, I was behind the curtain but another patient was bought in to the room. This was not appropriate."
Constable2,Apart from getting appointments its good,8/4/2016,4,Getting an appointment with a particular doctor is not easy. I've been told I can only call at 8am as no advance appointments are available at all. Even when you do call the appointments are often gone. Apart from difficulties getting appointments everything else is good. At times reception staff can be a bit brisk but other than that staff are good.
Constable2,Appalled,6/23/2021,2,I was appalled at the manner in which my wife was spoken to (on my behalf) by a Dr X chasing up my whereabouts when indeed l was sitting in waiting to be seen. We have come from an appalling practice and had hoped this one would be better as there is no choice to change Surgery here.
Constable2,Appalling,8/4/2016,1,"Appalling experience. Reception staff, nursing and pharmacy staff excellent, quality of care lacking."
Constable2,Appointment mix up,10/5/2016,5,I booked a blood test appointment at Capel but when I arrived the nurse wasn't there but the receptionist kindly spoke to the doctor and they actually took the blood - very good.
Constable2,Appointment system is confusing,6/6/2016,3,How appointments are allocated is confusing. Even when you ring at 8am they say all appointments are gone and the same happens when you go in to the surgery but you're told appointments can't be pre booked . You're unable to see the same doctor so when you see another doctor you get conflicting / different advice. If you do see the same doctor it allows them to see if there has been any progress or deterioration.
Constable2,Appointments ar difficult to get,9/8/2018,3,"Getting an appointment is very difficult, you are offered a triage appointment but it doesn't work as they then just say to come in anyway."
Constable2,Appointments are difficult to get,7/4/2017,4,Appointments are difficult to get at both surgeries
Constable2,Appointments easier to get at other surgery,11/20/2015,3,I find it easier to get appointments at the East Bergholt Surgery than here
Constable2,Appointments hard to get is don't drive.,12/14/2016,2,"Access to appointments at Capel is a big issue when you can't drive.  I was called by the practice and told that I needed to come in to see the doctor about a recent blood test and that I needed to call the next day.  By 8.10 the next morning all appointments were gone and I had to ask a family member to take me later in the day to East Bergholt.  There was no explanation by the receptionist that it wasn't urgent, which was worrying.  My medication just needed changing and it was a wasted appointment.  The discussion could have taken place on the phone"
Constable2,"Appointments hard to get, treatment indifferent",4/4/2017,1,Getting through on the phone and getting an appointment is difficult.  Some of the care and treatment provided by the doctors is not good.  Could wait weeks to see a doctor of my choice.  Practice management is lacking and could be improved. Reception staff are very good with patients.
Constable2,appointments system could be improved,7/4/2017,3,"More likely now to be directed to East Bergholt for an appointment rather than Capel.  The appointments system could with improving, like to be able to arrange an appointment in advance.  It's easier to come to the surgery and get an appointment rather than trying to get through on the phone"
Constable2,Appreciate the hospitality.,11/13/2017,5,"Very homely surgery , not like the really big surgeries.  The shutters on the pharmacy are very dirty."
Constable2,apps for a dr can be difficult,7/25/2016,1,"Getting an appointment (to see a nurse) for me has not been a problem but my husband has tried to see a doctor and this has been more difficult.
Blood test - he had to wait 3 weeks for an appt.so we had to go up to the Riverside clinic to get the appt. quicker.  going to the surgery is not good.
Regular annual checks.  I've been told they are not done anymore, but I know other people who have them."
Constable2,Attentive service and staff,11/13/2017,5,"The whole staff are really helpful, very friendly and approachable.  Appointments aren't difficult to get;  I tend to pop in for booking some appointments but phone for reglar blood tests.  I visit the surgery regularly and have not had any problems."
Constable2,Attitude not always great,9/8/2018,2,"The attitude of the doctors is not great, telling someone to think themselves better really isn't going to make you better when there is something medically wrong."
Constable2,Attitude of staff can vary,10/5/2016,2,"The attitude of staff can vary, some people are very accommodating and others not so friendly. I'm happy to wait for my appointment if I know I'll be given the time I need. The explanation of treatment is poor but this is partly due to there not being enough time in appointments. Even if one issue only takes a minute to discuss you can still only discuss that one issue in your appointment. My annual medication review take place on the phone but I can't understand how I don't need blood or blood pressure checks considering the medication I'm on. Also I have to request the reviews as the surgery has never asked me to attend or book an appointment for one."
Constable2,Attitudes have improved,11/20/2015,4,There has been an improvement in staff attitude and getting an appointment is easier.
Constable2,Bad communication between staff,11/20/2015,3,Bad communication amongst the staff. Mixed information.
Constable2,Be better if could book appointment in advance,7/4/2017,5,Being able to book an appointment in advance would be much better. I didn't need an emergency appointment so it would have been better to pre-book an appointment.  Getting through on the phone is difficult and I drove to East Bergholt to book today's appointment.  A queue waiting system on the phone would be an improvement
Constable2,"Been left, once again, with no medication .",9/10/2020,1,"3 phone calls one visit , told my medications will be ready , now having to face the weekend with no medication."
Constable2,Being able to see the same Dr would be better,8/4/2016,3,"Previously I had booked an appointment with a doctor as I knew that the nurse wouldn't be able to deal with the situation but when I turned up i had an appointment with the nurse who then had to get the doctor in. 
As I have a complicated medical history it helps to see the same doctor to save time explaining everything. 
Changes in medication from the hospital are not actioned and on two occasions the repeat prescription has been lost and I've had to chase it."
Constable2,"Better now, confident in the doctors",6/18/2019,4,"Better now than it used to be. It's quicker to get an appointment now and even if you have to wait a while on the phone you will still get seen. On the odd occasion you may be told there are no appointments but then you're offered a call back. When the doctor really thinks you need a follow up with them they will book you in the see them.
It's a busy surgery and pharmacy. The medications are generally available when needed you may have to wait a little bit but it's not too bad. Staff do try to get you seen here for blood tests which are regular. I've not felt rushed in appointments, the doctors are very good and never rush you out. If you'd asked me 18 months ago I would have said it was very different but I now have confidence in the doctors I see."
Constable2,Better since 9,11/20/2015,4,Better since 7.9.15 for appointments
Constable2,"Booking appts a problem, staff are lovely",3/4/2018,4,"Staff are friendly, it is getting more difficult to get appointments."
Constable2,Booking only on the day is not practical,7/10/2015,2,Booking only on the day is not practical especially when you are working. Treatment explanation varies depending on staff member.
Constable2,Bookings could be better.,11/13/2017,4,"Receptionists have a hard job and have to manage expectations and don't appear to get much support - staff are generally good..  The booking procedure is difficult.  Luckily, I have someone who can queue for me by phoning, would be very difficult to get an appointment as they are are all gone by the time you get through.  When you get to see a good doctor it goes very well.  Not everything is an emergency but you can't book an appointment for next week."
Constable2,Brilliant !!,6/19/2016,5,"I needed to see a GP urgently and was visiting friends. I only live in Ipswich and thought I would be asked to go back and see my own GP but I rang. I was offered a telephone triage appointment and after this I was seen promptly (within the hour) and my problem resolved.
I would never have expected this from my own GP let alone a surgery I was just visiting.
Having had a fantastic experience I felt it necessary to show my experience"
Constable2,Brilliant doctor,12/4/2018,5,"The last doctor I saw was brilliant, very good just hope he stays, I was very impressed."
Constable2,Brilliant surgery,3/13/2019,5,"Can get appointmetn on the same day if you want one, staff are curteous and polite and I have no grumbles at all. The changes made to the reception area have made a big difference, it looks much smarter and the call waiting is a big improvement to the system previously in place. Medical staff are good and I'm happy to see most of the doctors and they explain things well."
Constable2,Busy busy clinic.,11/13/2017,4,"The flu clinic times mean you can end up standing for 40 minutes which is a long time, plus if the weather is bad it's even worse."
Constable2,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,The phones are busy and if I'm 30th in the queue I tend to hang up and call later as even when I've been 10th it has taken half an hour to get through.  When you do get through I have been offered call backs with a GP so it has worked to get appointments.  Everyone is in the same position and the main thing is that you can get care when needed.
Constable2,Can be dismissive,7/27/2018,2,Reception can be a bit dismissive and don't explain why you can't have an appointment when you need it. I don't like being asked why I need an appointment either.
Constable2,"can be tricky to get appointment, limited continuity with doctors",7/4/2017,4,Quite often getting an appointment is easier if you visit the surgery.  It does mean getting to the surgery rather than phoning. Continuity with doctors is limited and you tend to see a different doctor each time.  Referrals have  worked quickly.  However it would be nice to see a doctor who actually knows you
Constable2,Can get appointment,2/11/2018,5,You can always get an appointment when you need one. I even got a double appointment this morning no problems.
Constable2,Can get appointments more easily,9/8/2018,3,"Being able to get appointments has improved more recently compared to when you had to visit the surgery to get one. Continuity with doctors doesn't happen which means you have to go back over all your history each time which virtually takes the whole appointment, so then they just seem to want to give you medication to finish the appointment. I think it's important to have time to discuss things with complex issues."
Constable2,can get appointments when needed,7/4/2017,4,The surgery is ok and I can get appointments when needed
Constable2,Can take a few days to get appointment,3/13/2019,3,"It can be difficult at times to get an appointment, this morning has been ok but at other times it can take a few days but works well.  Care has been good, I would like to see no attendance addressed to prevent so many missed appointments."
Constable2,Can take a long time to get through on the phone,7/25/2016,3,It's horrendous to get an appt.  I normally book on the phone or pop into the surgery.  It can take a long time to get through on the phone and all appts are gone.  you're just told to call tomorrow.  An improvement would be having extended hours in the evenings or at weekends
Constable2,Cannot get the consistency of the same GP,10/24/2019,3,"I really wish I could get the consistency of the same GP, I can't seem to get it here. I came from the hospital last night and was instructed to come to the GP this morning to get a blood test done, I was told by the receptionist that if I wanted a blood test I would have to wait 2 weeks or go back to the hospital, but I was instructed by the hospital to go to my GP to have it done today, my daughter has explained it and they eventually agreed to do it here today."
Constable2,Can't do what doctors say,9/8/2018,3,Doctors tell you that they want to see you in 4 weeks time but when you try to book with reception on your way out receptionists just say that you have to ring on the day.
Constable2,Can't fault,2/11/2018,5,"Very good got a double appointment this morning. Rarely visit but got an appointment ok this morning. Saw a lovely doctor today, very pleased and they have referred me on, can't fault."
Constable2,Care is good but hard getting appointments,12/14/2016,3,Medical care is very good but getting an appointment is difficult.  Seeing locums can mean that issues are not fully addressed as they seem reluctant to take things forward.  Previously you coud get in a queue on the phone but you't do this now.  It is easier to drive to the surgery to book an appointment.  There seem to be fewer locums at present.  The service is under pressure but they do a wonderful job.  Treatment has been good
Constable2,Care provided is good,11/20/2015,4,Care provided is good
Constable2,Care varies and getting appointments is hard,3/16/2017,3,"Care is very dependent on the doctor you see.  Some are very dismissive even when taking the children.  Others will just run lots of tests,  I don't feel reassured by visiting the doctors.  Getting an appointment is difficult.  Attended the flu clinic.  They have lost a test  sample in the past and didn't call to tell me the sample was not going to be tested and I'd have to have the test redone"
Constable2,Communication skills can be lacking,11/20/2015,4,Difficulty in understanding one doctor. No communication skills.
Constable2,Concerned my doctor is leaving,10/5/2016,2,I'm concerned that my doctor is leaving and the situation will get worse at the surgery. Getting appointments is already difficult and will only get worse.
Constable2,Consultants letters not acted upon,10/5/2016,1,The receptionists are helpful but one of the doctors will only refer on to hospital rather than doing anything them self. It is also apparent that doctors do not read consultants letters. This means that medications are not updated promptly. My husband was prescribed new medication by his Consultant but this wasn't changed by the practice for 6 months and was only highlighted by the Consultant when he had his next appointment.
Constable2,Continuity is an issue,6/22/2018,3,"Getting an appointment is difficult and seeing a specific doctor would be even harder. Generally I see locums, continuity is an issue. The placement of the press button for the doors is so far from the door you miss it, I'm hoping as its new I'll get used to it.  At times the length of appointments is a little limited but generally doctors have been good."
Constable2,Continuity is poor,3/17/2016,1,"Continuity is very poor so you have to go over the same issues all the time. Because of my health conditions it is very difficult to call at 8am. I called twice last week but was unable to get an appointment. 
When there is no continuity with doctors they often contradict each other. When I explain that another doctor advised I took the medication they just ignore the comment. Even since the CQC inspection I do not feel anything has changed. When I last used the online booking system it only offered an appointment in 10 days time, which was no good."
Constable2,Delays in prescriptions and a wrong instruction,3/16/2017,3,"Prescriptions are not getting to the pharmacy in time so it is delaying medication.  After being told to take medication by the hospital,  I was told to take 3 tablets a day;  it should have been 3 a week.  No harm was done though"
Constable2,Delays waiting for appointments.,7/25/2016,4,Quite long delays waiting for appts.  They don't keep you informed of delays which would be better.  On one occasion a nurse had been delayed and people were waiting an hour but no-one had said anything to the patients.  Staff are normally very helpful and generally do a good job.
Constable2,Did get an appointment this morning,2/11/2018,4,I called early this morning and although I was in a queue on the phone for quite a while I did get an appointment when I got through which is good.
Constable2,Didn't like the method of communication,7/27/2018,3,I called the surgery to see if I needed a blood test to know if I needed to continue taking a medication but I received a text message back saying I didn't need to take the medication any more but how would they know if I hadn't had the test needed to show if there had been an improvement in the levels after taking the medication.
Constable2,Difference when 10 min appointment abolished,8/4/2016,4,Big difference when 10 minute appointment was abolished
Constable2,Difficult to get a booked appointment,3/13/2019,4,"It's difficult to get a booked appointment at either of the surgeries with any doctor but you will get a call back and it will either be sorted or the doctor will give you an emergency appointment later in the day. The staff have always been quite pleasant but can be a bit different if you are trying to get an appointment. I am concerned about the future housing in the area plus I would like to see a walk in service like the one at Colchester, much more convenient to be seen that way."
Constable2,Difficult to get appointments,9/8/2018,3,The surgery looks tired and needs decorating. Its difficult to get appointments with a doctor you have full confidence in.
Constable2,Difficult to get flexible appointments,7/11/2018,3,When you work its very difficult to get flexible appointments. Booking advanced appointments is very difficult too and consistency with doctors doesn't really happen but the doctors are generally good.
Constable2,Difficult to get through on the phone,9/11/2018,3,You can't get through on the phone and when you do appointments aren't available but when you actually go to the surgery to book an appointment you can more easily get one.
Constable2,Difficult to make appointments early,8/13/2018,2,"Having to make appointments at 8am is very difficult. I've written to the practice previously, the response was very dismissive and unhelpful and issues were just shut down. The surgery needs to be refreshed and modernised. Information about doctors could be on the wall or website so patients know who they are.  you don't get to see the same doctor, so there is little consistency."
Constable2,Discontent with system in general,3/4/2018,4,"Pharmacy onsite is very good and the reception staff are very efficient. Phoning to make appointments is difficult i'd prefer a ringback system rather than the queue system. Overall capacity is an issue, have not been able to feel raising issue would be water off a ducks back. Could an open forum be held so that patients can raise issues & then see the progress being made/addressed.

If appointment booked in advance do a reminder text a couple of days before could the text message system be reversed so patients can cancel that way?"
Constable2,Doctor appointment for leg pain,6/12/2015,1,"A long wait to see doctor, when it was my turn the doctor was impatient and only half listening to me as she tapped away on her keyboard.
She consulted with hospital via speaker phone and then said, ""so you heard all that didn't you? so now you know!"" most unhelpful!"
Constable2,Doctor not reading consultant letters,10/5/2016,1,"My husband was given medication that said could effect his other medication, but when we raised this it was brushed off. If I need information I go to the pharmacist, much more helpful. The doctor actually told me that there were too many hospital letters on my husbands file for her to read but how can she treat appropriately with out a full and up to date understanding of what the different consultants have said."
Constable2,Doctors are very helpful,11/20/2015,5,I find the doctors very helpful and will spend time explaining things. At the moment everything is very good.
Constable2,Doctors explain well,3/13/2019,4,"There are not really any problems here. Doctors really do explain things well, its comforting to have time spent with you explaining issues. Queue waiting on the phones is much better as it mean you can at least get on with things especially when you're trying to get children ready for school.  Repeat prescriptioms can be difficult as you can put it in and even 7 days later some parts aren't ready for collection. I We have been close to the point where we have no medication left."
Constable2,Doctors generally good,3/13/2019,3,"You have to phone at 8am, I was in the queue for sometime but did get an appointment. If you're prepared to see anyone at either of the sites then you usually will get seen on the day. Doctors are generally good but they can vary a bit with explanations and there is little consistency with doctors you see. The reception staff are good and really helpful. If you call for results it often goes unanswered and messages are not responded to."
Constable2,doctors need to listen to patients,7/10/2015,3,Some time ago my wife was experiencing symptoms and when she went to the doctor he didn't think there was anything wrong. It was only when another doctor got involved that she was sent for further tests. Unfortunately even after surgery my wife died after a few years as things had spread. We did take it up with the surgery and felt that they dealt with our concerns although it didn't change anything.

We did take it up with the surgery and felt that they dealt with our concerns although it didn't change anything.
Constable2,Doctors vary,7/25/2016,2,During an appt. one of the doctors was on their phone as I was talking to them.  There are some very good doctors and the nurses are great.  Online booking doesn't work well as there are no appts available.  When the doctors say you need to see them you try to book an apt but the reception staff can't fit you in
Constable2,Don't get to see the same GP,4/4/2017,4,Don't get to see the same GP so you don't get to know them or them you which leads to questions being asked which aren't necessary.  I would prefer more continuity or for notes to be read before appointments.  A call queue system would at least let you know where you are in the line.
Constable2,Doors have improved,7/11/2018,4,"Good access, the improvements to the doors are much better. Staff listen, they are knowledgeable and fit you in when they can and I have a good rapport with reception staff. In bad weather it would be nice if the surgery would let you wait in the surgery to get out of the weather."
Constable2,Driving scheme works well and reception very good,7/4/2017,4,The reception staff are all very good.  Volunteer driving scheme works well.  I can't drive at the moment but the scheme has picked me up and will take me home
Constable2,Easier to get appointments lately,7/25/2016,3,"It has become a bit easier to get appts lately.  If you phone at 8.15 you seem to get through ok.  Getting this blood test has taken a month and to see the diabetic nurse another few weeks.
Community transport?"
Constable2,Easy to get appointments,3/30/2017,5,Personally I find it easy to get appointments.  Calling at 8 am it is very busy but understandably.  A strength is that there are 2 sites and this gives more flexibility
Constable2,Easy to make appointment,10/24/2019,4,"No concerns for me, it is easy to make an appointment."
Constable2,Efficient Service.,11/13/2017,4,Local surgery; surgery and staff are good.  Can get appointments when needed.; I tend to walk to the surgery to book an appointment.
Constable2,Enjoying the improved service received.,11/13/2017,4,"A good atmosphere at the surgery. The call waiting system is an improvement. When a family member was very unwell the staff, especially reception, were incredibly supportive and helpful."
Constable2,Everything is good,8/4/2016,4,Everything has been good
Constable2,Everything is great,8/12/2016,5,Everybody so nice to you when you come in.  I don't have any problems getting appointments.  Everything works very well and I'm happy with the service
Constable2,Excellent,12/14/2016,5,"Really liked the new doctor, very thorough - excellent.  The care has been very good recently"
Constable2,Excellent,8/12/2016,5,"The surgery is very good and generally works for me.
Really can't knock it"
Constable2,Excellent,8/12/2016,5,An excellent surgery as is East Bergholt.  The staff are very good.  No problems getting appointments and I really like the doctors I see
Constable2,Excellent,8/12/2016,5,"It's been great .  It's really wonderful that they offer GP Plus appointments when appropriate as these give more flexibility.
Additional written information would help when explaining problems"
Constable2,Excellent,8/12/2016,5,East Bergholt can be a little busier bu at Capel I've never had a problem.  Prefer Capel as it's smaller and more personal.  Getting through on the phone can be difficult at East Bergholt.  This morning I was given an appointment at Capel.  More prebookable appointments woud help.  The first prebookable was 10 December but I was given one at Capel today
Constable2,Excellent - easy to get appointments,3/16/2017,5,I have regular blood tests and can always get an appointment when needed.  Always been good
Constable2,Excellent care,8/12/2016,5,"I called this morning and was given an appointment later in the morning.
Extremely good care provided.
You do have to wait on the phone to get through"
Constable2,"Excellent, no problem getting appointments",4/4/2017,5,Not had a problem.  Most of the time I see the same doctor and I've never had a problem getting appointments.  A queue system on the phone would help.
Constable2,Explanations are not always great,7/25/2016,3,On the whole you feel you are being moved in or out quickly. Explanation is not always great and you can be left without a full understandin
Constable2,Fair,8/12/2016,3,Convenient for Capel residents.  Quite often it is difficult to get an appointment at Capel and I can't always get to East Bergholt
Constable2,Fair,8/12/2016,3,"I do notice a bit of a difference between the surgeries.  The receptionists here are very good.  Sometimes there are very long waits, especially at East Bergholt.
Difficult to get through on the phone but that is common a lot of surgeries"
Constable2,"Fair but erratic service, some staff good others not",4/4/2017,3,The service is a little erratic.  Some staff are very good and others not so much.  Some doctors will allow you to discuss issues if time is available whereas another told me it was time for his coffee break.  Getting appointments is also variable. Today has been fine;   I got straight through and got an appointment this morning
Constable2,Fair but hard to get appointments,11/13/2017,3,"Getting appointments is still a problem and people still queue at the surgery.  When you do get through the appointments are gone.  Getting to the East Bergholt surgery is difficult so it's easier to have appointments here. It's a bit better to have the call waiting system on the phone.  You are offered a call back but that doesn't work for all issues.
'"
Constable2,Fair but problems with appointments,3/16/2017,3,I called at 11 am and was told no appointments that day.  Offered a call back but at 4 pm.  When I had not heard back I called the surgery and was called by a GP within 10 minutes and asked to come to the surgery.  I would prefer a queue system on the phone
Constable2,Fair but problems with appointments,8/12/2016,3,Getting an appointment to see a doctor is difficult and generally you see a nurse instead.  The nurses have been very good.  More appointments are available at East Bergholt but this is not always easy to access
Constable2,Fair. care is hit & miss and appointments system is unfair,3/16/2017,3,"Online booking system de-registers you if you don't use it monthly.  Care is hit and miss depending on who you see.  I saw a GP recently and she told me I should take the weight off my foot and said ""Let's face it, you're not that slim"""
Constable2,Fast Response.,7/12/2018,5,"I reported being bitten by a dog.  A Doctor phoned me within a few minutes and after discussion, made an appointment for me to  visit the Capel St. Mary Surgery.  Within a half hour of the first phone call, I had received a Tetanus injection.  What an excellent service. Thank you very much."
Constable2,"Fine with staff, appt process could improve",3/4/2018,4,"Staff are fairly pleasant, they're helpful. No problems with getting appointments. Nurses are good and we discuss my ongoing treatment. It would be better to hear more capacity to see patients."
Constable2,First class service,12/14/2016,4,First class service.  The genera attitude of staff is good.  It works for me and I am happy with the care provided.  I visit regularly and have not had problems getting appointments when needed.   Due to sickness I've needed to come to Capel for my appointment and they phoned me nice and early to let me.
Constable2,"First time , nurse 'name' so caring",9/19/2018,5,"First time I have ever visited, Can’t say enough about nurse 'name' . She was so sympathetic and didn’t feel like I had wasted their time."
Constable2,Follow ups and after care great,8/4/2016,5,"Follow ups and after care from the doctors is great and they'll call me at home to discuss things further. Generally I can get an appointment on the day I need one, I do understand that the practice are lacking some nursing staff but this has not impacted on the care received."
Constable2,friendly and efficient,7/4/2017,5,The staff are all very friendly and efficient which is great.  The nurse is skilled and takes blood from me well
Constable2,Friendly atmosphere.,7/25/2016,4,Friendly atmosphere. drs. are pleasant.  Have my blood test done here.  I tend to visit the surgery to book my appts and never have a problem
Constable2,Friendly staff,4/15/2019,5,The surgery does have a lot of different doctors but this doesn't effect the care.  You rarely see the same gp but for me this doesn't impact. Book by phone which works well. Mostly have blood tests and can always go to the Riverside clinic if they can't give you an appointment. It's great to have the pharmacy on site. The staff are friendly and accommodating and there are no issues there.
Constable2,Frustrating experience,9/11/2018,3,"I find the surgery and pharmacy disjointed. I recently needed medication for while I was going to be away but when I picked up the prescription the extra medication wasn't there. In the end the GP had to okay it all again, which they did however, none of the surgeries had the medication. I then had to travel to a Boots pharmacy to get the medication. Its frustrating that they couldn't have let me know so that it could've been sorted earlier and in less of a rush."
Constable2,Generally fine,1/8/2022,4,"The waiting on the phone to get through to reception can be a bit long, but you do get through in the end and appointments are available. I've used econsult but it said to call the surgery, so I ended up having to call anyway. I think it would be a good addition to have video calls with a doctor, it would mean you don't need to come to the surgery but that you are actually seen and they get to see your demeanour."
Constable2,Generally good,11/20/2015,5,"Generally good, sometimes have a short wait which is understandable"
Constable2,Generally I do get an appointment,7/25/2016,3,Due to the phone lines being so busy in the morning it is easier to come in to the surgery to book an appt.  Generally I do get an appointment but sometimes have to go to East Bergholt.  Staff have been good with the limited experience I've had
Constable2,generally works well and act quickly,7/4/2017,4,Generally the surgery works well and they have acted very qyickly when needed.  Nothing is too much for them
Constable2,Getting an appointment is difficult,12/8/2016,4,Getting an appointment is difficult still. Care is good once you get an appointment though.  I called 2 weeks ago as I was waiting for results but was told I couldn't talk to a doctor as the doctor dealing with the issue was away and I'd have to wait. I then tried to see any doctor about another problem but was told there were no appointments available by 10.30 in the morning. I was not offered a call back and was told to call again tomorrow.
Constable2,Getting an appointment is difficult,7/10/2015,5,Getting an appointment is difficult I have been on the phone trying to get through for 30 mins in the past. The nurses at both surgeries are really great. They are nice and friendly.
Constable2,getting appointment is a problem,7/4/2017,4,Getting appointments is a problem and the time spent on the phone trying to get through is frustrating
Constable2,Getting appointments can be difficult,3/17/2016,3,"Getting an appointment can be tricky, often you're asked to go to East Bergholt which is much more difficult.  I requested a blood test at an appointment, which was done, but i was then asked to come in and see a different doctor about it. When I saw the doctor I was told off for asking for the test as the doctor I'd seen had been a locum an should not have agreed to it. That is for the surgery to inform locums what they can and can't do."
Constable2,Getting appointments can still be an issue,3/16/2016,4,Waiting room is a bit tired and getting phone appointments still can be difficult in the morning.
Constable2,Getting appointments has got better,8/4/2016,5,My child has health problems and is seen straight away. Getting an appointment has got better
Constable2,Getting appointments is difficult,3/30/2017,4,Getting appointments is difficult;  it's better to visit the surgery to get an appointment Queue system on the phone could be better.
Constable2,Getting appointments is difficult,7/25/2016,4,"You can't see the doctor you'd like to see and getting an appt. is difficult.  When you call for a pre-booked apt, you're often told to call on the day but then appts. are limited and choice of doctor is too."
Constable2,Getting appointments is not a problem,8/4/2016,4,Rather than treating problems the doctors tend to refer you to hospital. Sometimes communication can be a problem and understanding what is said is an issue. Getting appointments has not been a problem.
Constable2,Getting appointments is very difficult,7/10/2015,4,"Getting appointments is very difficult and you can't pre book even if the doctor has asked you to book for 2 weeks time. Getting through on the phone can mean calling back a number of times, its hard work if there are no appointments you're just told to call back tomorrow.  The reception staff at East Bergholt make re-ordering prescriptions/controlled drugs easy. Even when I made a mistake they did all they could to make sure my son would get his medications."
Constable2,Getting through at 8am on phones is difficult,8/4/2016,5,Getting through at 8am on phones is difficult so have to come to the surgery to book. Good that receptionists don't ask why you're booking an appointment.
Constable2,Given an appointment for later in the week,2/8/2016,3,"6 months ago I asked to see a female doctor, it wasn't urgent but I was given an appointment for later that week which was good."
Constable2,Given 'flu vac at Capel rather than my local,9/30/2020,2,"Sign for 'flu clinic upside down near door and no other signs. Went inside to reception, receptionist said she was busy. Worried about being late, I asked at Pharmacy, very helpful, someone came outside to inspect the sign which was supposed to indicate that patients should walk round to the back of the building and he turned it the right way up. Told nurse who was quck to say it was not her job. I had overheard her complaining to a patient that they were in the wrong place outside and she could not see anyone waiting. I said I was alerting her about the signs but she continued to cut me off saying she was 'phoning someone about my concerns, the second one being why I had an appointment at Capel. Her manner was authoritarian, quite rude and stressed. I shall avoid any further encounters."
Constable2,Good,12/14/2016,4,Never had a problem with the surgery.  Everything works well.  A little more patience with children when they are having injections and the use of diversionary tactics to help calm them
Constable2,Good,8/12/2016,4,"The surgery is good.  I do prefer to go to Capel as it's smaller and more personal.
A good service"
Constable2,Good,8/12/2016,4,"Prefer Capel - it's more personal.
Access to Capel rooms is a little tight with a wheelchair"
Constable2,Good,8/12/2016,4,"Explanations do vary depending on the doctor you see.  Some expect you to know more than you do.
Depending on the day it can be difficult to get an appointment too"
Constable2,good,7/3/2019,4,Capel surgery is looking a little tired.  Capel Pharmacy is really very very good
Constable2,Good and most staff helpful,3/16/2017,4,"Nurses very knowledgeable and helpful  The pharmacy has been brilliant, the receptionists helpful. Most doctors very good with one or two exceptions.  One has been rude to me and family members"
Constable2,Good but need more docs,4/4/2017,4,"Considering the size and ageing population in the area, more doctors are required.  Having the local surgery in Capel is very useful.  Doctor could be in charge of pharmacy to take some of the load off the
GPs.  GP surgeries should have additional funding.  Reduction in hospital managers could then be transferred to GP settings."
Constable2,Good care provided,2/11/2018,4,"A local surgery with a pharmacy on site which is useful. Care from the doctors has been good, tend to see any of the doctors who are available. Its fairly reasonable to get appointments and I'm happy to go to East Bergholt if necessary. They do a good job"
Constable2,Good new locum GP's,3/16/2017,4,Some of the locums have been really great;  they seem more up to date with their knowledge than some of the GPs.  Could GP+ be put in local newsletter?
Constable2,Good nurse. Blood tests hard to get and problems with prescriptions,12/14/2016,4,"My last prescription didn't include all the medication that I expected but there was no discussion about changing it.  Explanations are a little lacking.  Blood tests at the surgery are difficult to get, the waits are about 3 weeks.  Saw a really great nurse recently, very thorough"
Constable2,Good staff and service.,11/13/2017,5,Very local surgery.  Normally can get appointments when needed.  The reception staff have squeezed me in as I accidentally missed an appointment.
Constable2,"Good, helpful staff",3/16/2017,4,Most of the receptionists at the surgery are very helpful.  One is particularly helpful and I really can't fault them
Constable2,Good. Can get appointments easily & drivers good,3/16/2017,4,"Don't use the surgery often but when I do I can get appointments when needed.  A larger entrance way/lobby would be helpful especially for buggies,  The volunteer drivers work very well for getting to and from appointment"
Constable2,Got an appointment when needed,2/8/2016,4,I had an appointment last Thursday. I started calling at 8 am and got through quickly and was seen at 9.20.  I also had a query about a test result so went back to the surgery and the receptionist got the doctor to call me to put my mind at ease.
Constable2,GP gave me confidence,12/14/2016,4,The GP gave me confidence.  In the past  I've had experiences of being let in to my appointment when the other patient was still in the room
Constable2,Great home visit,9/8/2018,5,I needed a home vist and the doctor who came out to see me was very good. I was referred to hospital and an ambulance was called to take me.
Constable2,Great pharmacy,8/4/2016,5,"Even when they are running behind there are reasons for this and its ok. The doctors tend to tell you what you need to know but do not elaborate due to the time allocated for appointments.  The pharmacist is great he's very efficient and sorts out any problems, he's a true professional"
Constable2,"Great staff, timekeeping not so much",9/4/2018,5,Keeping to time is not great which there are reasons for but reception are good at helping sort issues out.
Constable2,Had problems with home visits,4/15/2019,2,We've had difficulty getting a doctor to do a home visit for my husband.
Constable2,Had to demand a referral to an ear clinic,7/15/2016,3,This was the 4th visit to get a clump of dry ear wax out of my ear.  First visit was in Sept. 2015.  On this visit I had to demand a referral to an ear clinic. Said clinic removed blockage first visit.
Constable2,Happy to see anyone,9/11/2018,3,Its important to have a local service. Get to see a doctor when needed and I'm happy to see anyone when I need an appointment. You can normally get one when needed too. It would nicer to have continuity with the doctor I see but its not essential.
Constable2,Happy with how things are,3/4/2018,5,Very satisfied with the service provided.
Constable2,Happy with new doctor,12/4/2018,5,"Really happy with the new doctor, such a lovely person, very supportive. Wonderful. The surgery has improved recently."
Constable2,Happy with the service I receive,3/23/2018,4,Having a local service is good and I got an appointment first thing this morning. Receptionist were very good. Sometimes you are asked to go to East Bergholt which isn't great when you're unwell. When there are more patients with the new houses the practice will be even busier. Always happy to see any doctor.
Constable2,Happy with the service.,11/13/2017,5,Friendly helpful staff.  Everything works well and the call waiting system is good on the phone
Constable2,"Happy with the surgery, staff great",8/12/2016,5,Really happy with the surgery.  The way staff are with you is great and they can't do enough for you
Constable2,"Hard getting blood tests, receptionists lovely",12/14/2016,4,Usually have to go to East Bergholt for an appointment.  Getting blood tests Capel is very difficult and most of the time I'd go straight to the Riverside Clinic.  Once you see a doctor they aren't too bad.  Capel is a big village and needs a surgery.  Reception are loveley;  they take a lot of flack from patients.  Some staff can be a little superior when talking on the phone
Constable2,Hard to get appointment,12/14/2016,2,Getting an appointment is very difficult at Capel and as I don't drive getting to East Bergholt is also difficut.  One doctor doesn't really listen and just shrugs you off.  It's easier to come to the surgery to get an appointment rather than try to get through on the phone.  It's very uncertain if you will get an appointment but on the whole the nurses have been good.
Constable2,Hard to get appointments over the phone,4/4/2017,3,Coming to the surgery is easier to get appointments than calling.  I'm old fashioned and would like be able to call and get an appointment  in a couple of days.  My hearing isn't as good as it was and at times  I struggle to understand what is being said.
Constable2,Hard to get through for same day appointments,9/29/2016,4,Time to book appointments its hard to get thru for same day appointment
Constable2,Hard to get through on the phone,8/4/2016,4,Frustrating trying to get appointments as it is hard to get through on the phone and you never know who you will see. There have been many changes in staff and you are asked to go to the Riverside clinic for blood tests.
Constable2,"hard to see a doctor, and no continuity",7/4/2017,2,"Getting to see a doctor from the practice is difficult,  tend to be locums and a different person each time which means there is no continuity.
The receptionists and phlebotomists are all great, first class"
Constable2,Hard to see specific GP and no continuity of care,4/4/2017,3,Getting to see a specific doctor is very difficult.  There is no continuity of care and this does impact on the care received as they don't know you well
Constable2,Have seen improvements lately,9/11/2018,5,Recently there has been an improvement at the surgery.  They have referred me on to have treatment after a wellman clinic picked up something. They take concerns seriously and act upon things quickly. Changing to a non appointment based system would be better like at another local surgery.
Constable2,Have to book on the day,3/16/2016,4,Had to book an appointment for my 97 year old mother. You have to book on the day instead of being able to book a week ahead. Waiting for an appointment is ok but not enough doctors and hard to get an appointment with the doctor you want. GP's may not have enough time to read patient history in 10 minute appointment. If you could see the same GP then it would be easier as they'd be more likely to remember.
Constable2,High turnover of GPs,7/27/2018,4,There is a very high turnover of GPs which isn't good but seeing the locums is often good.
Constable2,High turnover of staff,10/21/2022,2,"There seems to be a high turnover of staff, some stay longer but then just leave. After an experience years ago when my husband was at the end of his life I will not see one of the GPs because of the way they treated him.  They were dismissive and did not listen to our concerns."
Constable2,I had a very positive experince,1/9/2015,5,"I saw one of the more longer serving doctors at the practice and was very impressed with their clinical management of my condition. I had no complaints. I rang up on the morning to be offered an appointment, which I happily accepted. I had to wait about 5 minutes as the doctor was running late, but I have no issues with that. Clearly another patient need more time than the governments allocated 10 minutes. 
I am really unsure how I could feedback to make this encounter better. Perhaps that the practice needs a bigger purpose built building in Capel? Thank You."
Constable2,I have had two minor and two serious problems,6/8/2017,2,I question the ability of the doctors to give a proper diagnosis and appropriate medical advise. I have difficulty on leaving hospital in getting appropriate prescriptions. Getting appointments requires an early morning queue outside the practice/
Constable2,I like new appointment system,10/24/2019,3,"I like the new appointment system, it is good from the point of view that you get to see a GP on the day. It is not easy to be able to see the same GP each time unfortunately. The dispensary staff could be a little more friendly."
Constable2,I like the call back system,10/24/2019,5,"I have epilepsy and I have my reviews over the phone now rather than going in which is much better for me. I do like the new call back system, it is much better now."
Constable2,I really like our doctor.,7/25/2016,4,"I really like our doctor.  He's very friendly & understands the condition very well.  
Getting through on the phone is a problem;  however you do get an apt when you need one."
Constable2,ignored my symptoms,3/3/2020,2,"Been back and forth for years with pain and had multiple pain killers for my knee, treated like I was a nuisance, finally got referred to hospital to be told my knee is beyond help and I need a full replacement."
Constable2,Impressed with the service,10/24/2019,5,"My husband had a quick positive referral to the hospital, I am impressed with the service. I do find that the pharmacy often do not have my prescription ready on time even though I come in on the due date I regularly seem to have to wait or come back."
Constable2,Improved in the last year,3/17/2016,4,Improved in the last year. The worst thing is not having the same doctor I'm not known by any of them anymore.
Constable2,Improved recently,7/11/2018,5,"Can get appointments when I need them, its improved more recently. If I can't be seen I will be offered a phone call. Chairs could do with being replaced as they are split. When consistency is lacking it means that the bigger picture is missed as history is not taken in to consideration. When medications are discussed it can get very confusing and it would help if a bullet pointed note could be given to help remember what  is changing. Reception staff are very pleasant, helpful and professional."
Constable2,Improvement in staff attitude reently,11/20/2015,4,There seems to have been an improvement in staff attitude more recently. I can appreciate appointments may run behind when emergencies or complicated appointments take place too so that is not an issue
Constable2,Inappropriate advice given by reception staff,6/18/2015,1,"I was very unwell in the surgery and had an angina attack, I used my spray but was told I would need to drive myself to the East Bergholt branch to see a doctor. When I arrived I was seen immediately and he phoned the consultant straight away."
Constable2,Inconsistent,8/30/2018,3,Since the change in staff it has been inconsistent.
Constable2,Inconsistent care,6/27/2017,3,The care provided is inconsistent.  Some of the locums have been great whereas others at the surgery haven't been so good
Constable2,Inconsistent service,4/4/2017,3,"Sometimes the service is good, at other times not great.  Explanations are limited and at times it feels like you are being held at bay.  It just depends on who you see"
Constable2,I've never had any concerns,7/10/2015,4,I've never had any concerns with the treatment I've received.
Constable2,Kind and helpful,8/4/2016,5,"Staff are always kind and helpful, very helpful. Very grateful"
Constable2,Lack confidence things will be followed up,1/8/2022,1,"I have multiple complicated conditions but I feel that issues are treated in isolation and not holistically. I've been told by a doctor before that I have complicated issues, which I know, but that they only addressed the simple issue in the appointment and not the reason I had booked the appointment. I felt so dejected after this.  Even when I was diagnosed with a new condition I've not been able to see a doctor to discuss the implications. I have seen the nurse, who said I needed to see a doctor, but then when I spoke to the doctor on the phone they said they didn't need to see me.  I have regular blood tests, monthly, and have done for ages for one of my conditions, and then all of a sudden I'm being questioned about whether they are needed and what they are for.  My notes are comprehensive so should explain why they are being done.  When you do get a call back from a doctor I assume they are on hands free as it's very quiet and difficult to hear what they are saying.  The lack of continuity with doctors for me is a real issue as each time I speak to someone different they have different ideas on how to manage the problems and I have to quickly explain as much as I can because they haven't had time to read my notes.  I know they are doing their best but for me it's not working."
Constable2,Lack of detailed diagnostic tests.,12/17/2015,4,I coughed for over 20 years and was diagnosed with asthma. I went to see a chest physician in London who could not believe I had never had a CT scan - despite having private medical insurance. One hour after having the CT he showed me a lump in my upper oesophagus. After more investigations I had to have surgery in London and the cough disappeared within days. I have written the doctors but did not want to make an official complaint as no doctor is infallible - only God is. My main point is to remind all doctors to use private tests when patients have private health insurance and take some pressure off the NHS. I must have 8 NHS chest x rays over the years but never offered CT.
Constable2,Lack staff,6/6/2016,3,One day last week there was a note on the door at Capel  saying they had no doctors that day and patients were being told to try East Bergholt to see if they could be seen there. There has also been a sign saying no blood tests could be done and that patients should go to the Riverside Clinic for tests.
Constable2,Like call backs,3/13/2019,4,"Everyone at the surgery is friendly and you can have call backs to discuss issues which works well. I don't mind calling on the day for an appointment, the medical staff are fine and I'll see whoever is available. It would be better if the pharmacy could be open outside doctors hours to enable easier collection."
Constable2,Like the phone system,3/13/2019,4,"The phone system that is now in place is much better, having the queue system works so much better and you know where you are in the queue."
Constable2,"Like the phone system, helpful staff too",3/23/2018,4,Got through on the phone quickly this morning and generally Drs & Nurses are good.
Constable2,Limited blood test appointments,9/8/2018,3,I needed a blood test so the surgery sent me up to the hospital for it rather than doing it themselves. Its not so bad for me as I can drive but others would struggle more.
Constable2,Little continuity due to changing staff,6/18/2019,3,"Getting appointments with any of the doctors at either site is taking 10-14 days which isn't good. There are a lot of locum doctors who move on other locations too. A high turn over of staff does mean you get very little continuity, which impacts the care you receive. 
When seeing staff they do give time to listen and good advice.
Getting through on the telephone is much better than it used to be."
Constable2,"local and convenient, can be difficult to get appointment",7/4/2017,5,The surgery is local and convenient and having a pharmacy is a big help.  It's not always easy to get an appointment when calling in the morning.
Constable2,Long term condition support not great,1/8/2022,1,"I'm finding the support with my long term condition basic and everything is then blamed on the condition, even if it is totally unrelated. There is no continuity with doctors, and this therefore affects the care provided, and means I lack confidence in what is said, as each person varies in what they suggest. I feel constantly pushed to my specialist nurse when its not related to my condition. I also feel that I've not been referred to the hospital for issues that I should've been."
Constable2,Main issue is getting an appointment,7/4/2017,4,"The main issue is getting an appointment.  Normally you have to wait a considerable time to get through.  I can never get to see my doctor.  I haven't seen her in months as you can't make advance appointments; to be able to do so would be much better.  Staff are generally good, am happy with them"
Constable2,Managed to get an appointment today,9/8/2018,2,"I needed an urgent appointment today and did manage to get one but normally its very difficult to get one. I was offered a triage appointment which did work ok, it would be better to have an open surgery session like another local surgery does. It would be good to have toys for the children especially as appointments often run late. Explanations from GPs can vary depending who you see."
Constable2,Medication changed with out notification,10/5/2016,3,I had my medication changed with out them letting me know. I had an adverse reaction so had to be changed straight back.
Constable2,Medication has been wrong a number of times,10/5/2016,1,My medication has been wrong a number of times and when i order them they don't always arrive.Doctors don't spend time explaining things very well . I've had difficulties when I needed my catheter changing. When I rang the nurse I was told I needed to speak to a doctor which delayed things further. When my husband needs assistance they just give him more medication rather than finding out what the problem is and it feels like they are always looking for an easy way to get out of the appointment. Getting house visits for my husband who can't get to the surgery is not a problem but the care can be lacking. One doctor will never do house calls and they only ever refer you on.  Reception staff however are okay.
Constable2,Medication not given after hospital,10/21/2022,3,I found out recently that I should've been given certain medication followong a hospital stay last year. It was only when the issue reocurred that I was told I should've had it last time.  I do find the call backs from the doctors are good but there is a doctor I will not see now due to them being rude and blunt with me in the past.
Constable2,Misdiagnosed,10/5/2016,2,"Doctors at the surgery misdiagnosed me. They said I had asthma but in fact I had a heart problem, they hadn't looked at this possibility. I woke up in the middle of the night and fell, I was then rushed to hospital where they diagnosed my heart problem. The pharmacy is really great and the reception staff have been good too."
Constable2,Mixed experience,10/5/2016,3,I don't go unless I'm forced to go as you never see the same doctor and they do not follow up on test results. The pharmacy is brilliant and the girls on reception are great.
Constable2,Mixed feelings with doctors.,3/23/2018,4,Doctors aren't very good I have no faith in them. I've had so many medications prescribed wrongly. The doctors are nice but I don't feel confident with them. I don't feel that raising issues would actually be beneficial. It falls on deaf ears. Getting appointments and being seen runs smoothly which is good. The locum i'm seeing today is very good.
Constable2,More training,6/7/2016,2,More staff training on mental health would be helpful
Constable2,Need better education,7/15/2019,2,"Mental health services is a bit of a tick-box exercise and this is well acknowledged.
Despite going to see the mental health link worker about clear trauma, I was only offered stress management online course of University of Suffolk lecture.
Doesn't address real issue, rather is a barrier to further help as leads to a sense of hopelessness. Stress management for rape trauma is not a suitable recommendation. 
They didn't even recommend Rape Crisis charity or anything. 
They need better education on services out there."
Constable2,"never an issue getting appointment, cant see same GP though",7/4/2017,5,Never had any problems getting an appointment.  The phone system is much better than it was.  The only thing is not seeing the same GP each time you visit
Constable2,New doctor very very nice,2/8/2016,5,I saw the new doctor recently and she was very very nice. She really listened to me and had read my notes before seeing me. I can already see that she is going to be great to have as a doctor at the practice.
Constable2,New system works well,10/24/2019,5,No issues with this surgery and the new system works well for me.
Constable2,Nice and friendly. More capacity please,3/15/2018,5,"Nice and friendly and the GPs I've seen have been good. It would be better if the surgery had more capacity. The queue system is an improvement, at least you know where you are and I got an appointment.  Nothing really needs to change as I've got an appointment when needed. They've always fitted me in."
Constable2,Nice and Local,10/24/2019,4,"It's nice and local to me, I cannot think of anything that could make it any better than it is."
Constable2,No appt. for a specific dr for a week,2/8/2016,3,"I tried to book an appointment to see the doctor on duty today but no appointments were available. I was told that if I wanted to see him specifically he would be back next Thursday. I think continuity of care is important however, the locums have been brilliant."
Constable2,No concerns,10/24/2019,4,"No concerns for me at this surgery, all fine."
Constable2,No in depth explanation of illness,11/20/2015,3,No in depth explanation of illness. Not enough time.
Constable2,No issues getting appointments,9/8/2018,4,I have no issues getting appointments when I need them. I was told I would see a specific doctor for an issue but this didn't happen. There was nothing wrong with the care provided it just seemed a good idea to have someone dedicated to me.
Constable2,No issues getting appointments.,7/25/2016,5,Capel have been good here and East Bergholt.  Not had issues getting appts. at either surgery
Constable2,No problems,6/6/2016,4,"I popped in to the surgery to book an appointment today and had no issues. From my perspective there are no problems and the way they organise  transport for me is great, using the volunteer drivers."
Constable2,No problems getting appointments,7/25/2016,5,I really like seeing the nurse and have no problems getting appointments.  I always book ahead of time by phone.  Always been very well treated.  For me the surgery works really well.
Constable2,No support and no one listens,10/16/2017,1,"I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes about a year ago by the Norfolk diabetes prevention study. I had previously always suspected I had diabetes as my 'fasting sugar' level was often high. However, even shortly before the diagnosis the GP's refused to listen to me.
Following the diagnosis I have had to 'fight' to have any help with my diet and management of diabetes. To be head I have had to involve a private endocrinologist dietitian and nutritionist at BUPA. Currently, I am receiving no support with my diet and the surgery is only willing to arrange 6-monthly blood tests."
Constable2,No wait for appointment - treatment very good,8/12/2016,4,Never have to wait for an appointment.  They are brilliant with my daughter
Constable2,Normally fine once in,6/6/2016,4,Once you get in the surgery its normally fine but my husband has had to have blood tests every week. He has really struggled to get an appointment here and the alternative is Riverside or the Hospital which take 3 or 4 hours to do on the bus. We are only 5 minutes walk from the surgery. There is no regular nurse to do the tests and it is making life very difficult.
Constable2,not a problem getting an appointment,7/25/2016,5,I don't come very often but when I do getting an apt has not been a problem and I've been happy with the care provided
Constable2,Not difficult to get an appointment.,7/25/2016,4,I've not found it difficult to get an appointment.  For advanced appts. I go online but for on the day I call.  I have had to wait for my blood test but I've not been asked to go to Riverside. I'm mainly seen at Capel or East Bergholt.  I'm meant to have an annual check but I haven't been asked to attend for 2 years.  I called the surgery and explained and was given an apppt today.  Apparently I should have been called in January
Constable2,Not explained fully,8/22/2018,3,I had a difficult appointment and I felt that things were not explained fully and I wasn't happy. At follow up appointments the doctors seemed just to be worried that I might make a complaint.
Constable2,Not had problems getting an appointment,7/25/2016,5,Appointment procedure has improved over the last year.  I've not had problems getting appts and booked my blood test ahead of time so I had an appt. when I got back
Constable2,Not used much,1/8/2022,3,I haven't needed to use the surgery much for years as get my medications and see the nurses. When I had quite  a bad reaction to the covid vaccination I tried to talk to a doctor to find out what I should do and whether I should have a follow up injection  but there was no care or concern shown and they wouldn't or couldn't give me an answer.  I felt very dismissed and let down at the one time when I really needed some assistance.
Constable2,Nurse was excellent,12/14/2016,5,I saw the nurse last and she was good.  She explained everything and carried out a general checkup.  I got on very well with her and was really pleased
Constable2,Nurses are very good,11/20/2015,5,The nurses are very good. We wanted mum and dad to have an appointment on the same day at roughly the same time and reception managed to organise this for us so both will be seen this afternoon.
Constable2,Often no nurses at Capel surgery,6/3/2016,3,More often than not there are no nurses available at Capel and only one doctor. Being over 75 I've been told I have a specific doctor but I don't always get to see her. I have regular INR tests but because I need the blood taken from the back of my hand the 2 nurses at East Bergholt can't do the tests and only one person at Capel can do it but she isn't available all the time.
Constable2,Often referred to as East Bergholt,11/20/2015,3,Capel is my village practice - often referred to as East Bergholt which is not very convenient.
Constable2,Often told no appointments available,9/11/2018,3,Getting appointments is difficult and you are often told that there are no appointments available on the day you call.
Constable2,"On computer, not looking at you",3/17/2016,4,"Usually wait is 10 minutes. I really don't like it when they are on their computer and not looking at you in appointments. I had called to say blood test was not right, but when I went for the appointment the doctor didn't know why I had been told this. It doesn't worry me that I don't see the same doctor all the time. The nurses are really first class and you are able to get an appointment when you need one."
Constable2,On the day appointments available now,3/13/2019,4,"Better than it used to be here, its a big improvement that you can get appointments on the day now. The queue on the phone generally ok but you don't always get to see the doctor of your choice but generally ok. The changes to the reception area in much improved too."
Constable2,Once in care and treatment are good,6/3/2016,3,Once you get to see the GP the care and treatment is good but it is difficult to get an appointment.
Constable2,Online booking could improve.,11/13/2017,5,Only improvement I would like to suggest is more accessibility/availability of online booking slots - very few are available
Constable2,Overall Good,11/20/2015,4,"Staff attitude - very good
Waiting times - bad"
Constable2,Pharmacy and reception extremely helpful,7/10/2015,4,I find the pharmacy and reception staff extremely helpful. I don't often visits the doctors but the contact with other staff has been good.
Constable2,Pharmacy could be a lot better.,11/13/2017,4,Staff are pretty good.  The reception staff are helpful and polite.  The call waiting system is ok as you at least know where you are in the queue.  Repeat prescriptions can be wrong at times and the pharmacy does not run as smoothly as previously
Constable2,Phlebotomist I’ve seen recently is fantastic,7/4/2021,5,"I am a regular blood donor and have had many blood tests in the past. I have seen Julia Philips the phlebotomist twice recently for routine tests and she is the best I’ve ever seen. No pain, no wiggling of the needle once it’s in and no bruising."
Constable2,Phlebotomist I’ve seen recently is fantastic,7/4/2021,5,"I am a regular blood donor and have had many blood tests in the past. I have seen Julia Philips the phlebotomist twice recently for routine tests and she is the best I’ve ever seen. No pain, no wiggling of the needle once it’s in and no bruising."
Constable2,Phlebotomy concerns,10/24/2019,4,I have regular INR tests and I am concerned that the phlebotomist in Capel St Mary is not planned to be replaced? I am very concerned if this is the case as I live in Capel and its difficult to keep travelling to East Bergholt or Ipswich.
Constable2,Phone system is an improvement,2/11/2018,4,I can get appointments when I need them. the phone system is an improvement from the previous one and I like using the online system for booking advanced appointments. Staff are all quite good too.
Constable2,Phoning can be a struggle,11/13/2017,3,It's so difficult to get through on the phone so it's easier to queue which isn't great in the winter.
Constable2,Phoning in could do with improvements,3/23/2018,4,Its easier to visit the surgery to book appointments. Easier access via phone would be better.
Constable2,Pleased with my doctors,9/1/2017,5,I find it easy to book to see my doctor and I find he is clear and helpful. Waiting times in the surgery can be up to 25 minutes.
Constable2,Pleased with service given.,11/13/2017,4,They do try to be as accommodating as possible.  Haven't had a problem and the receptionists are very good.
Constable2,Pointless,6/1/2015,2,"Cant book appt on advance. Self employed so cant let clients down on the day uless the doctors is willing to pay for loss of earnings...took new born with fractus movement in neck. lady told it was colic, I knew it wasnt colic & im no doctor, given 10 boxes of carobel which are unused (Ill return) took new born to an osteopath he fixed her within a few hours as it was due to c-section.. doc's should have more understanding of these things rather than dishing out unneeded medicine.."
Constable2,Pointless,6/1/2015,2,"Cant book appt in advance. Self employed so cant let clients down on the day unless the doctors is willing to pay for loss of earnings...took newborn with fractus movement in neck. lady told it was colic, i kne it wasnt colic & im no doctor"
Constable2,Poor,8/12/2016,2,"Very frustrating trying to get an appointment.  It's the biggest challenge.
The care and treatment is very good;  it's just frustrating you can't aways get through, especially when you'r trying to get children ready in the morning"
Constable2,poor,9/30/2019,2,Reception staff are a bit mixed in their helpfulness especially in relation to getting appointments
Constable2,poor,9/30/2019,2,Appointments are very difficult to get and a locum has diagnosed an issue I've had for 12 years but none of the doctors had picked it ip
Constable2,Poor - hard to get appointments,3/16/2017,1,Getting an appointment is really difficult.  I tend to go into the surgery to get one as it's easier
Constable2,Poor - surgery is tatty and hard to get appointment,3/16/2017,2,Very rarely get an appointment.  Communication is very difficult with the doctors.  The building is a bit tatty
Constable2,Poor care,3/16/2017,1,My husband went to the doctor and was dismissed by the GP when he raised concerns about his mental health
Constable2,poor in regard to presciptions,8/14/2015,1,"I took a sample of urine to surgery. did not hear anything.  I went to pharmacy.  The lady said ""Oh I have some tablets for you.  They have been ready for more than a week.  This happened again on 3 6.  I saw  Dr.  xxxx .  they said ""Iwill not give you anything because the hospital have prescribed.  they are at the pharmacy."
Constable2,Poor service,3/16/2017,2,When I got my last medication there was no repeat prescription form.  When I asked for more medication I was told that they needed a week's notice so they are now having to rush the request through as I need my medication sooner
Constable2,Poor.,8/4/2016,3,"Poor. I've no confidence in what has been done today. Will wait and see what happened. Just seen a doctor, I asked all the questions - got ""yes"" no answer. How is that for an explanation! I pay for all my physio/osteopathy but need an ultra sound form for my injured shoulder. Doctor explained 'nothing' to me - just looked. What a consultation. Cleanliness was terrible, fairly good now."
Constable2,Poor. Can't see the same GP,3/16/2017,2,"Would prefer to see one GP for ongoing conditions;  seeing different doctors means you get different treatments.  Some don't even give you the feeling that they are listening to you and others are so quick to refer you to hospital for every little thing.  One of the locums has been great over the years.  After my last visit I left thinking ""What is the point?"""
Constable2,Poor. Hard getting appointments,11/13/2017,2,Getting appointments is a particular difficulty.  Not being able to get an advanced appointment is difficult too as you have to ring each day and hope to get an appointment .  The call waiting system on the phone is an improvement.  Being asked to be seen by a doctor and then not being able to book an appointment is frustratin
Constable2,Poor. hard to get appointments.,11/13/2017,1,"Getting appointments at the moment is very difficult, run very late which is difficult too, especially if self-employed.  Receptionists can be fire fighting and they can lose empathy at times.  The nurse who took my blood was very good.  When running late it would be great to be kept informed and for doctors to at least acknowledge the delay"
Constable2,Pre booking not possible with named GP,7/10/2015,3,Pre booking an appointment with your designated doctor is not possible. 2 hour wait to get through on the phone. It causes more added stress for people and it could be easier to get appointments. Overall the treatment I receive is good and getting appointments although not easy is not the end of the world.
Constable2,Prompt response,8/10/2020,4,"Used the E Consult form three times recently, very prompt response from GPS."
Constable2,Quality of care has improved,11/20/2015,3,I've noticed an improvement with how staff have been with me. The quality of the care I receive has improved when there is continuity with the doctor I see.
Constable2,Quite easy to get appointment,3/13/2019,4,It's generally quite easy to get an appointment on the day and if not they offer a call back from the doctor which is good. On the whole doctors engage well with children and explain things well to them. The queue system on the phone does work but you can wait a while to get through. The changes made to the reception are are a vast improvement and moving reception allows much more confidential discussions with staff.
Constable2,Range of services available has reduced,10/5/2016,3,The range of services available at the surgery have reduced. There have been times when different doctors give contradictory advice which doesn't make it easy as a patient.
Constable2,Really good doctor,10/21/2022,5,The doctor I saw recently was really good. I was very pleased with the appointment and how they explained everything.
Constable2,Really impressed by locum,8/4/2016,5,"We saw a locum doctor today and he went through all the medication that my daughter takes and he was really good, very impressed. Just a shame he won't stay."
Constable2,Recently improved,11/20/2015,5,Since Dr (Name removed) came so much has changed for the better especially being able to see the doctor of your choice.
Constable2,Reception staff are good,3/13/2019,4,"Will generally get an appointment when you need one. Reception staff are very good and helpful. You can at times be asked to book another appointment to discuss very quick issues, which don't need an appointment and seems like a waste of time."
Constable2,Reception staff brilliant,10/21/2022,2,The reception staff are brilliant and generally the staff in the pharmacy are too but it is chaotic in there. I'm on specific medication and my consultant has said that it is best to stay on a specific one due to side effects but the surgery change the medication to suit them and I assume go for the cheapest option which causes me problems.  It often feels like everything is just too much trouble for the doctors and it often takes multiple visits to get issues sorted and because you see different staff things just drag on.
Constable2,Reception staff superb,3/16/2016,4,"Reception staff superb, pharmacist also superb"
Constable2,Reception very helpful,3/30/2017,4,Reception very helpful.  There should be some recourse if people miss their appointments to prevent non-attendance.
Constable2,Referrals aren't done well.,7/25/2016,3,"Referrals to consultants even when emergencies /urgent are not done quickly.
Making an appt. is difficult; it's easier to visit the surgery to book to see a doctor.  Phlebotomist appt. had a 3 week wait and then a further month for a nurse appt."
Constable2,Regularly making mistakes,4/23/2021,1,"I've regularly had bad services from this practice. I have had appointments booked incorrectly, for example, I turned up for a blood test on Friday and was told that the appointment was actually booked for the day before Thursday at 11:10 and I had the wrong day, however, I had not made the appointment until Thursday afternoon! The surgery seems to think I can time travel back in time! The surgery has incorrectly referred me to the wrong department at the hospital, increasing my wait time for an appointment related to cancer. I regularly have the wrong prescription sent over to the pharmacy from the GP, it often takes them 5 attempts to get it right."
Constable2,Room for improvement,7/25/2016,4,Room for improvement with appt systems. I couldn't combine 2 appts. so I have had to come back a few hours later for the second.  There is a little bit of a delay to get blood tests done but generally I can get appts 2 weeks ahead.  The staff including doctors are great
Constable2,"Run efficiently, but dont like automated system",7/4/2017,4,Run efficiently.  Tried to call this morning.  I don't particularly like the automated system mainly because it goes on so long.  I decided to walk to the surgery to book the appointment as it is easier than being on the phone
Constable2,See a different doctor everytime,5/26/2018,3,No continuity of care
Constable2,See the nurses most,1/8/2022,4,I've not needed to use the surgery much but when I do I see the nurses. I haven't see a doctor for 4 years.  I do feel that there are times when a face to face with a GP would be needed. The care received from the practice has been good.
Constable2,See the same doctor mainly,2/11/2018,5,I have no problems getting an appointment and I get to see the same doctor most of the time. The staff are very accommodating and I really can't fault the care I get. It can be difficult for the GP's to get to see notes and information from the hospital treating me.
Constable2,Service is variable,3/16/2016,4,The service is variable - was going up but now going down since we lost GPs. Nursing service is very good and have been able to get an on the day appointment -although can't book online at the moment. Clean but it does need renovation. The waiting times are usually good especially at East Bergholt.
Constable2,Shortage of staff,6/6/2016,3,Due to staff illness I had to go to the riverside clinic to have my blood taken.
Constable2,Some brilliant staff,9/11/2018,3,"There are some brilliant staff at the surgery but also some that are not so good, it can be a little hit and miss."
Constable2,Some good doctors and some are not,5/8/2015,3,Can't get an appointment unless you scream down the phone. Better off going to a and e to see a doctor . Ring at 8am for an appointment and gone by 8.30am
Constable2,Sometimes difficult to make appointments,11/20/2015,3,Sometimes difficult to get through to make appointments and to see doctor of your choice
Constable2,"Staff are brilliant, would like more continuity",3/23/2018,5,Well pleased with the surgery. The receptionists are great and having the pharmacy on site is very good. It's a shame to not have more continuity with the doctors and tend to see locums who don't know your history. In an urgent situation the doctors were wonderful and saved my life when I collapsed.
Constable2,staff are friendly and will do all they can,7/4/2017,5,Staff are friendly at the surgery.  Generally they will do all they can to help
Constable2,Staff are under pressure,8/4/2016,5,Staff are under pressure and doing their best. Very pleasant. My doctor is very good very empathetic.
Constable2,Staff attitude can vary,7/25/2016,4,"Staff attitude can vary;  from a medical point of view it is good.
I have seen a bit of an improvement lately with appts.  I called at 8.10 and got an apt this morning.  Having two surgeries makes it easier to get an appt when you'd like one"
Constable2,Staff attitude has improved,2/11/2018,5,"The surgery has improved a bit, you can now get appointments on the day more easily. Attitude of staff across the practice has also improved. It would be nice to have a bit more continuity with the doctor you see as it can feel a bit disjointed and can mean explanations differ."
Constable2,"Staff attitude is good, waiting times a bit hit and miss",8/12/2016,4,"Staff attitude is always good.  Waiting times can be a little bit hit and miss but depend on the day.
It's a pleasant local service.  East Bergholt is a nice surgery overall with good facilities  Can get appointments when I need them"
Constable2,Staff didn't understand importance,11/20/2015,3,Recently I've got glass in my heel. The staff didn't seem to understand that being diabetic I needed to be seen with some more importance.
Constable2,"Staff friendly & excellent, hard to get appointments",8/12/2016,5,"Staff are friendly and excellent.
I just wish it was a little easier to get an appointment"
Constable2,Staff make the practice,11/20/2015,5,"The staff make the practice, they're great."
Constable2,staff quite good,2/11/2018,4,"The change to the phone system is a bit better, you do have to wait a little but do get through. I was given a choice of East Bergholt or Capel today and I took the one most suitable. The staff on the whole are quite good and generally the surgery is ok."
Constable2,Staff turnover too high.,8/4/2016,3,Unable to see why so much turn over of staff and lack of medical staff.
Constable2,Staff very good,10/24/2019,3,"The staff are very good at both locations within the practice, Capel St Mary has got planning for 700 houses, I have got concerns of how the surgery will cope with the increase of patients."
Constable2,Still hard to get an appointment,8/4/2016,5,Still hard to get an appointment and you sometimes have to fight for it. The triage system works and the reception staff are good but appointments often run late.
Constable2,System has gotten better.,3/4/2018,4,"A local service, you have to be on the phone early but the queue system is an improvement."
Constable2,Taken ages to get referred to hospital,10/5/2016,2,I had been asking to be referred to hospital for the past 8 years and my chiropodist agreed that I needed to be referred but they kept trying other things which didn't work. Finally I've been referred after asking for so long. Not seeing the same doctor doesn't help with this and they haven't been great at explaining things. The pharmacist is however good.
Constable2,Takes 20 mins to get through to practice,6/12/2015,1,"Practice was inspected by CQC but only East Bergholt. They did not look at Capel St Mary or consult any of the patients. WHY???
Practice needs to improve its appointment system and be more flexible."
Constable2,"takes long time to get appointment, cant see own GP",7/4/2017,4,It's taken a long time to get an appointment at the surgery with a GP.  I am now seeing another GP as again unable to see my own GP
Constable2,Terrible,4/11/2022,1,"Was diagnosed over the phone but asked to see a doctor, got sat down and basically talked about because I dared to ask to be seen. The tone, manners and language used made me feel uncomfortable and told off."
Constable2,The experience has recently improved.,7/10/2015,4,"The experience recently has improved with both staff attitude and getting appointments, The pharmacy is good and they are happy to spend time talking to you."
Constable2,The most wonderful doctor.,8/13/2018,5,"I don't like going to see doctors if I can help it but the staff at this surgery are so wonderful that they put me at ease immediately. The reception staff are open, welcoming and helpful. The pharmacy staff are outstanding and the doctor I saw today was particularly wonderful - empathetic, attentive, astute, professional and kind. I feel very lucky to have a centre like this as my local surgery."
Constable2,The new call back system disrupts my day,10/24/2019,4,"I'm not keen on the new call back system as it disrupts my day waiting to be called back. I do find the privacy in the surgery is limited as the pharmacy is right in the waiting area, could the pharmacy staff be more discreet please when they speak to patients."
Constable2,The nursing staff are great.,5/29/2015,5,"The nursing staff at the surgery are great, they spend time with you and actually treat you. I can't fault them."
Constable2,The phlebotomist is good,2/8/2016,3,"Most of the time I have my blood tests done at Capel, on occasions I have to go to East Bergholt which is more difficult as I am reliant on someone to take me. The phlebotomist is good and as long as you book ahead you can get an appointment when needed."
Constable2,They don't seem to want us.,8/4/2016,1,I get the feeling that they want everybody to go to Bergholt. We are treated very badly.
Constable2,They listen to me,2/11/2018,5,They're looking after me well. They listen to me and when I ask questions they provide good explanations and information. Generally they do a good job however I will not see one doctor as they are abrupt and condescending.
Constable2,To keen to check on irrelevant matters.,5/16/2017,2,"I have not had flu for years, seldom ill enough to require a doctor, practice sends out letters regularly asking me to go for a check up, have  flu vaccination and such!  Why should I go to a place where sick people go and risk catching an infection. You lose confidence in doctors when they are constantly wanting to check  you're not ill! 

! lived with pain for over 8 years when they didn't diagnose torn tendons, they worry about tests for conditions I don't have and am unlikely to get.  I was getting around on a broken leg for 6 weeks!  It's important that doctors take note of what the patient tells them not just what they think is important!"
Constable2,Told different things by different drs,9/29/2017,1,Took my ten month old son to the doctors as I was concerned as he had been unwell for a week and had a horrible cough and wheeze. At his appointment I was told he was fine and didn't need any further help or medication. The next day he developed a rash covering both of his legs and he still had an awful cough and wheeze. When I took him back 24 hours later he was seen by a lovely doctor who said he had a virus which caused the rash and needed antibiotics! To be told two completely different things in 24 hours is disgusting!
Constable2,Treatment is alright but they don't listen,3/15/2018,3,Treatment has been alright. One doctor just stares at the computer screen and it is very difficult to get an appointment. Don't feel that the practice listens to patients when there are problems. A couple of doctors have been very good but they tend to be locums.
Constable2,Unable to get an appointment on the day,2/8/2016,3,"In the last month I tried to get an appointment but was told there were none available that day but that a doctor would call me back, which they did. I then had an appointment with a doctor 2 days later in East Bergholt."
Constable2,Unable to get appointment,10/21/2022,3,When I tried to get an appointment for a dressing to be done there were some available but the system would not allow the receptionist to book any of them. Instead I was given an evening appointment at the Riverside clinic but needed to take my own dressings with me. There were none available at any of the pharmacies in town and I spent the day trying to find some. In the end I had to go with out them.
Constable2,Unable to see GP of choice and poor attitude,4/4/2017,1,Unable to see the doctor I trust for weeks.Felt that the way I was spoken to by the duty doctor was not good.  A sample I gave has been lost so hasn't been tested.
Constable2,Use rarely,1/8/2022,5,I've only used the surgery twice in 7 years and the doctor I spoke to last was very good and was understanding of my approach to health (homeopathy) which I was really pleased about. My husband is waiting for surgery and he has been dealt with very well too.
Constable2,"Used to be awful, now totally different",11/20/2015,4,"It used to be awful. Couldn't get appointments, made to feel patients were an inconvenience. Now totally different - welcomed and treated much better. Keep it up!"
Constable2,Very difficult to get an appointment,6/10/2016,1,I started ringing for an appointment at 8am after a 10 min wait was told all appointments for the day had gone. I was then told I cannot pre book but if I need an appointment on the day the only way is to queue outside the surgery before 8am.
Constable2,Very efficient service,12/14/2016,5,"I had a blood test and I had the results back next day.  I was booked appointments for further scans within days,  Everything was ok but it was great how quickly everything was organised,"
Constable2,Very good receptionists,2/11/2018,4,"The receptionists are always very good, accommodating, very friendly and do all they can to fit you in for an appointment. I've had mixed experiences with the doctors which is a shame."
Constable2,Very good surgery,4/4/2017,5,Very good surgery; staff are very friendly and helpful.  The only problem I have is getting an appointment.  It is easier to visit the surgery than phone and this is what I have done.
Constable2,Very good will do all they can,7/4/2017,5,Very good up here and they will get you in when they can and do all they can to help
Constable2,Very happy with my doctor,6/18/2019,5,"I am very happy with my doctor, I try to see her when I can. No real issues Good at fitting you in for INRs when needed. Staff at both sides are excellent, fit you in and are helpful. They try to accommodate as much as they can."
Constable2,Very happy with th surgery,8/12/2016,5,Very happy with the surgery.  Waiting times are generally quite good.  Very happy with the explanations given.  They couldn't do enough for you.  Was told that sharps couldn't be handed in at East Bergholt but only at Capel St. Mary
Constable2,Very helpful,7/11/2018,4,"Non medical staff are very helpful and do what they can under pressure. Medical staff are good, most of the time I can get an appointment but it can be frustrating being on hold for some time but it is so much better than the previous system. Because you see different doctors at each appointment it takes away the personal element and they often haven't read your notes before the appointment."
Constable2,Very helpful,3/30/2017,4,Very helpful especially the reception staff.  I see the nurse twice a year but rarely visit other than that.  Can get appointments when needed.
Constable2,Very helpful,8/4/2016,3,"Very helpful including the pharmacy and the waiting times are ok, better than East Bergholt."
Constable2,Very helpful service,6/18/2019,5,"Overall I can't fault the service,, they've been helpful. Might have a long wait on the phone, it was 30 minutes this morning but I still got through and was able to change my appointment time. Staff were very helpful. The phone system is an improvement.
The service does lack a personal approach, as you don't get to see the same doctor each time you see someone new you have to explain everything again. Can't fault the reception staff, they are always helpful. You can often have a couple of things to discuss with the doctor but by the time you get through there aren't 2 appointments side by side for a double appointment."
Constable2,Very kind doctor,9/12/2019,5,"I went to Dr (name removed) on Friday with a chest infection. She wasVERY kind and sympathetic, spent some time discussing the appropriate antibiotic that didn’t react with my other medications. Thank you."
Constable2,Very poor. One GP is rude another is a bully.,9/14/2017,1,"I dread dealing with them.  I have done all I can to get another practice to take me, but they will not.  Despite constantly asking that my GP is changed.  the same GP turned up at my house;  she is rude and behaves as if she owns it. Another one bullies me.  I can't understand the African type doctors in the practice due to theri very thick accents.  The secretaries often don't answer the phone for 10 minutes when you press ""one"" for ""medical emergency"""
Constable2,"Very, very bad - So bad I have left!",7/10/2016,1,"I have had a number of negative experiences: I called when my elderly mother was telling me she was suicidal and I couldn't get an appointment and I wasn't offered any advice or signposting, I waited for an hour for a flu jab last year and when I got to the front of the queue I was told they were closing (I was less than pleased because they had run out of one of the vaccines!), I called the practice manager on five separate occasions and didn'tgeta single return call."
Constable2,"Very, very poor.",12/5/2016,2,"We have just moved from a very good practice at Kesgrave. Found the surgery here very, very poor. So we have already changed to another practice. Hopefully the new practice will come up better."
Constable2,wait 1-2 weeks,7/10/2015,5,For non emergency appointments you may have to wait 1-2 weeks. I would think and hope to get an emergency appointment on the day. Continuity of care with the doctors would be better if I saw one doctor. May be a generational thing where older people are used to having one doctor but I feel it would help.
Constable2,Waiting times a hindrance,11/13/2017,4,Waiting times can be a bit long.
Constable2,Waiting times at Capel are shorter,7/10/2015,4,Waiting times to see the nurses at Capel are generally shorted than at East Bergholt this is probably because it is a much quieter practise.
Constable2,Waiting times have been better,7/10/2015,4,"Waiting times recently have been better but there are occasions when you fan see a patient come out but no one does in for 10 mins, why?. Appointments - You have to queue to be able to see a particular doctor. You can go in there at 8am and there will be a lot of people already in the queue as it is easier to get an appointment. I was in an appointment and before I'd finished with the doctor he had bussed in the nest patient who walked straight in to the room. The person left the room and waited outside until I left. This is not the first time this has happened either."
Constable2,"Works well, no problems",6/18/2019,5,"Pharmacy is good and works well. Appointments are available as and when needed, although I haven't needed to see a doctor for quite some time. Blood tests are either here or Heath Road Hospital, but here is good. Blood test results are available quickly and there are no problems."
Constable2,Would like better continuity,2/11/2018,4,Continuity with a doctor when you have a long term condition is important other wise you end up having to repeat yourself each time you see someone different. Not having to repeat yourself would be good.
Crestview,3 days trying to get through,11/19/2018,4,"Has taken a while to access an 'on the day' appointment as trying at 8 am 3 days on the trot, by the time I get through they've gone.  Can't do advanced anymore which I find a bit silly."
Crestview,5 days to get appointment,11/19/2018,4,"Maybe I am just unlucky, but I find it very difficult to obtain an appointment, either can not get through on the phone line, or there are no more available. I called 30 times this morning before I got through.  I have called daily for 5 days for this appointment."
Crestview,Access at both surgeries,11/19/2018,5,"I came across today after seeing a Nurse at Alexander Road surgery, to see the Nurse practitioner.  Find 8 am difficult to call due to working hours.  Need perhaps another option to call later."
Crestview,Access to nurses is easy,7/10/2018,5,"Always get appointment with the nurses easily.
I have only needed to see a GP once and I did within 2 hours of the phone call as it was an emergency.
Asking extra questions works as they are short on GP's, so this has become a nurse led surgery."
Crestview,Access to services challenging,7/10/2018,4,Always found the people lovely here. It has become more and more difficult to get an appointment though. I know there are less and less GP's and the NHS is under strain. I have to see a heart specialist and will not see one at the Norfolk and Norwich until 9 2018
Crestview,Ages to get through,11/19/2018,4,"Do not like the 8 O'Clock phone appointment, it takes ages to get through.  More communication to give us more options would be good."
Crestview,All is great,6/7/2018,5,Been coming to the surgery for 18 years and all is great for me.
Crestview,All is great,12/4/2018,5,Been coming to surgery for 18 years and all is great for me.
Crestview,Appointment access OK,12/14/2018,4,"I find that I can get an appointment when I need one, however this is quite rare.  I take care of myself and think that just helps."
Crestview,Appointment booking could be better,12/4/2018,4,Wish could book for a couple of days later. Currently today morning 20 mins late.
Crestview,Appointments are difficult & not listened to,12/4/2018,3,"Booked today's appointment 3 weeks ago, but on the day appointments are very difficult to get. I do not really feel listened to either. Moved here when I moved house recently. Feel that going back to old system of turning up and taking a ticket would work well."
Crestview,Awful waiting time,6/21/2016,3,Everytime I go hear the waiting time is 45-1hr after appointment time and there knowledge of mental health care is non existent and no arrangements made for people with anxiety think extra training is needed for this area
Crestview,Called on a Saturday,12/23/2021,4,"Got an appointment today. Initially we missed the ring back last week, but the GP called again on a Saturday afternoon and I was told to ring first thing on Monday. I did do that which took ages to get through. (It was explained that this is busiest time to call a surgery).  In the end we did get through and being seen here as no appointments at Alexandra road which is closer to us.  Pleased to be seen though"
Crestview,Cannot fault,11/19/2018,5,"Rang today near 11 am and got an appointment for my mother today within 30 minutes, which we felt was excellent. Cannot fault them."
Crestview,Cannot get through on the telephone,7/10/2018,3,Only issue here is trying to get through on the telephone for appointment. I did get through eventually and able to see GP on the day. Appointments can run up to an hour late.
Crestview,Coming here is more convenient,7/12/2018,4,I was sad that the hospital (Lowestoft) was closed. I couldn't get to Kirkley Mill for blood as 3 buses away for me. Coming here is more convenient.
Crestview,Convenient to get to,12/4/2018,4,I was sad that the hospital (Lowestoft) was closed. I couldn't get to Kirkley Mill for blood as 3 buses away for me. Coming here is more convenient.
Crestview,Doctor quite rude,5/4/2018,4,Doctor quite rude. Try and stay at Alexander rd for my appointments
Crestview,Efficient vaccination,12/23/2021,5,"Was left a message to make my choice of where I would like my vaccination 1st time, but had to go to a different site for my 2nd dose in Oulton Broad. All extremely efficient though."
Crestview,excellent,9/14/2017,4,Went to nurse one afternoon in March. They immediately sent me to A &E at James Paget hospital.  Seen by doctors in evening and immediately had life saving operation next morning.  Had stoma and was told it was not reversible.  Excellent care.
Crestview,Extended hours info,11/19/2019,4,We do have trouble getting an appointment and I would happily trave to another site but never been offered it. I didn’t know about until was just told by the HWS CDO.
Crestview,Generally get appointments when needed,3/4/2019,3,"Do not mind the 'on the day' system. It does take ages to get through, but generally get an appointment when needed."
Crestview,Generally pleased with care,6/7/2018,4,"Wish could book for a couple of days later. Currently today, running 20 mins late."
Crestview,Get an appointment easily,8/9/2016,4,Seem to get in relatively easily
Crestview,Geting an appointment is very difficult,7/12/2018,3,"Booked today's appointment 3 weeks ago, but on-the-day appointments are very difficult to get. I do not really feel listened to either. Moved here when I moved house recently. I feel that going back to old system of turning up and taking a ticket would work well."
Crestview,Good on the day system,11/19/2018,4,"I called today and got an appointment straight away, so I cannot fault it.  You do wait a while to get through first thing, but if you call a bit later you do get through quicker and there are still appointments, which is unusual as my previous practice ran out half an hour after the surgery opened."
Crestview,Good with the kids,11/19/2019,4,"Find it difficult to get through on telephone. Reception can be very rude, depending on who you get.
They are however very good when it comes to the kids. Listen well and see them quickly. On one occasion I would have had to have gone to A&E as I was very worried."
Crestview,Great service all round,3/17/2016,5,I have every confidence in my surgery. I have dual sensory loss and they are very good and caring.
Crestview,Here as can’t get in at Alex Rd,11/19/2019,2,"I am under Alexander road but they couldn’t get me in, so my ill mum has brought me here today. Rang at 8am but by time got through none were available at Alexander road.
Reoccurring issue and they just keep giving me antibiotics every month. I want a ENT referral and will be pushing for it today."
Crestview,I find them very rude,7/10/2018,3,"Getting an appointment is difficult. Reception staff ask what the problem is. I said it was confidential, but they said they need to know so the GP has a note of it before they see me. so I disclosed. However, when I saw the GP they did not know why I was there, so I do not believe what they said. They are not medically trained and are the gatekeepers. I find them very rude with it too."
Crestview,Lack of communication,11/19/2018,4,"There is a lack of communication between each professional that I see here and at the hospital, leading to no continuity, No one ever seems to know where I am with my conditions.  Haven't seen a GP for more than a year. Seem to always be repeating myself which is frustrating."
Crestview,Lack of info wasting my time,11/19/2018,2,Nurses and doctors at this practice need to inform patients that they can self-refer for physio.  I have wasted a few weeks because of this.
Crestview,Like appointment system,11/19/2018,4,"I like the appointment system, it works well.  The staff are lovely.  My only negative is that the music can be too loud in the waiting room"
Crestview,Mixed on the staff front,11/19/2018,5,The GP's and Nurse practitioners are great and always helpful.  I do not find the reception staff are always as helpful.
Crestview,Never see same person,11/19/2018,3,"Over these 3 years I have had shoulder issues.  As I barely ever see the same person twice, no one ever does anything other than inject with steroid or give me pills.  I eventually self-referred for physio.  They say I have arthritis but have done no blood tests, x-rays or anything to prove that this is the diagnosis. It's like they are guessing and actually not interested.  it is affecting my life.  One GP said 'you seem depressed, do you need tablets?!' I said 'No, but I am fed up'.  I just want to be looked after and get the right treatment/diagnosis for this."
Crestview,Not been here long,11/19/2019,4,"Seeing GP today, but I rang 2 days on trot, 40 times today before I got onto the holding system.
I will register for online access to help I think"
Crestview,Not too bad overall,11/19/2018,4,"My experience here has been very mixed.  You now can only get appointments on the day, and generally you do get through and get one.  Not being able to book an appointment for a specific GP as there has been so many different GP's here, I do not think we have a dedicated one.  When you fill out forms, it asks 'who is your GP', and I am unable to give a name anymore."
Crestview,Not too long to wait,12/23/2021,4,Called the surgery a couple of weeks ago and now I have to come back for a blood test in 2 weeks. As this is not particularly urgent I think that is a fair timescale of waiting.
Crestview,Phlebotomist very kind to see me,7/10/2018,4,"I arrived today to have a blood test at the surgery and so checked in on the system.20 minutes later the Phlebotomist was with her bag, about to leave the surgery and she looked at me realising I was on her list. She kind took me in and took the blood. Seemed that the screen had not worked as she had had no notification telling her I was there.
I was thankful to her."
Crestview,poor receptionists,6/22/2017,4,Receptionists not all great
Crestview,really good experience & excellent doctor,4/20/2015,5,I registered as a temporary patient as I was visiting family in Lowestoft and the receptionist was very helpful to get my son seen asap.  He had been seen twice by out of hours doctors and they were very pointless. He had a temp for three days I couldn't get down. The doctor listened to all my concerns and then spent 25 minutes examining him and found out that he had a bad case of tonsillitis. The doctor was excellent and very friendly.
Crestview,Receptionists so rude,11/19/2019,2,"The way a particular receptionist talks to me is unacceptable. So abrupt. You stand at the desk and it’s ‘yes!’ No smile,nothing. I asked if you need to go to ‘charm school’ to work here, because they need to.
Screen not working today didn’t help.
Doctor said to book appointment in 2 weeks and she said they cannot do it that far in advance. So I suggested she tells the Doctor that.
Appointment runs late, message says, ‘if appointment more than 10mins late, speak to receptionist.’ So you do and it’s a ‘well they are busy seeing other people’. Just a diabolical response when you have information telling you to flag it up, and that’s what you get.
It’s so frustrating. We are moving house soon and out of this surgery."
Crestview,Rude staff so went elsewhere,7/10/2018,2,"I rang the surgery for an appointment as I was extremely unwell. The receptionist did not deem it to be a need for an 'on the day' appointment. The staff member was extremely rude there. One week later and I was still experiencing the same illness so I called Alexandra road surgery with the same issue and they were lovely and got me into on the same day to see a GP. I do not use the surgery much as I too work in the NHS, so understand the challenges. This experience showed me the disparity between services, and that a receptionist is a gatekeeper. I felt a call from a GP would have been the minimum they could have offered."
Crestview,Some staff are rude,11/19/2018,5,Some of the receptionists can be rude on the phone.  I find being asked more questions than before intrusive.  I do now know why as the HWS CDO explained and so I understand now why this is.  Some days though due to health I would still say that I do not wish to disclose.
Crestview,Soon got appointment,11/19/2018,5,"I soon got this appointment.  It is a follow up to key 'eye on things' and I was seen quickly, which is great."
Crestview,The service has improved,8/1/2018,4,This service is much better now. It has taken time to get established but I now can look each time for my next 6 week test as I'm on warfarin.
Crestview,Used it 3 times,7/10/2018,5,"I have only been here a year, and so only used the surgery 3 times. Every time though I have seen a nurse which is fine. Everything has always been fine for me."
Cutlers Hill,1991 excellent service - 8 + partners now 2,6/28/2019,1,"My GP left 18 months ago. no replacement  GP's off sick/stress or retired
overworked long waiting time for appointment - little communication between specialists.
 I have been to NHNN, RHIM (London) Ipswich, N&NUH JPH Aldeburgh, Loddon.Beccles, Sol;e Bay, CutlersHill, PSH, Dentist, but little exchange of info
also home visits from Falls prevention team, podiatry, Neuro nurse and physio, Continence delivery service within the last year !"
Cutlers Hill,4 weeks wait to see GP,7/12/2018,2,Trying to get appointment here is really difficult. Waiting up to 4 weeks to see 'any' GP. I have now moved surgeries to Bungay as I moved house recently.
Cutlers Hill,6 week wait,6/14/2016,3,Had to wait 6 weeks for appointment. Concerns around my angina medication so would have liked it sooner. A lovely surgery nonetheless
Cutlers Hill,Able to see my previous midwife elsewhere,8/21/2018,3,"I was not particularly happy with what I heard about the local Midwifery team, so I was very pleased to be able to have the choice to see my midwife from previous pregnancy at a different surgery."
Cutlers Hill,Access good for me,10/2/2020,5,"I have had to come here two days on the trot, and so I think that is good. A lovely surgery, and I cannot fault it."
Cutlers Hill,All doctors and nurses are welcoming,9/16/2015,4,Always receive a friendly welcome at the surgery from all the staff and they look after us well when we need to go for regular appointments.
Cutlers Hill,"Always a warm receptionist, helpful",5/11/2021,5,"At this challenging time, it would be understandable if staff were to feel pressured and yet my experience has been that they are committed to providing reassurance and manage to respond appropriately at all times....pharmacy staff are particularly efficient and pleasant to deal with...."
Cutlers Hill,Appointment booking is awful,6/5/2018,4,You can only get appointments for 2-3 weeks time or call at 8am. Being short staffed has had a knock on effect to patients. What the future holds is anyone's guess.
Cutlers Hill,Appointment issues,4/25/2016,4,It is really hard to get and appointment here. Unless it is really urgent I wait 2-3 weeks.
Cutlers Hill,Appointment system is not great,6/4/2019,3,Don't like the system. It's taken 3 weeks now to see a GP if I refuse to see a nurse. I know about the shortage of GPs but when you are so unwell it is no consolation.
Cutlers Hill,Appointments readily available,7/10/2015,5,Helpful staff & appointments always offered promptly
Cutlers Hill,Brilliant service from Livi,4/26/2023,5,"Called the Doctors for an triage appointment that day, they booked me in with a livi doctor who called me within an hour. The doctor was based in London (I asked) she was absolutely brilliant, so helpful and didn't rush me. She took the time to discuss the problem and prescribed me some medication, which I collected at lunchtime. what a brilliant service, we are so lucky to have Cutlers Hill Surgery."
Cutlers Hill,Brilliant Surgery and lovely friendly staff,5/28/2021,5,Have recently moved here and cannot believe how lucky I am is to have such am amazing surgery on my doorstep. The staff are so lovely and friendly.
Cutlers Hill,"Called first thing, triaged and seen that day",7/12/2022,5,"called the surgery, triaged by a lovely clinician and saw a doctor within 2 hours. brilliant service. thank you"
Cutlers Hill,Can take three weeks to get a GP appointment,1/26/2019,4,"Apart from that, friendly reception staff and I have had a good experience when using the surgery"
Cutlers Hill,Capacity concerns,2/13/2019,4,"I do not use the service very often but I am concerned about the capacity for the appointments and staff. There is inevitably more building work going on, it is a worry."
Cutlers Hill,clinicians are brilliant,7/12/2022,5,"We all know there is a national shortage of doctors and they only have 2 at Cutlers Hill. I am really positive about the practice. The clinicians they have on-site Nurse Practitioners, Urgent Care Practitioners and Mental Health nurse are absolutely brilliant and really knowledgeable. The NHS is changing, evolving and the days of always seeing a GP for everything are outnumbered. These clinicians are well trained and study for their qualifications, one in particular specialises in women's health, which is so helpful for menopause questions. I have never had a problem with this Surgery they are always helpful, kind and caring. I love the same day system and feel its so much better than having to wait for a routine appointment. I don't think patients realise how good this surgery is."
Cutlers Hill,Couldn't get an appointment for nose,6/5/2018,2,"Broke my nose. Went in for an appointment at the surgery and had to sit for hours and did not get seen, just told I had to try again tomorrow as you can't get appointments for that. Get told not to use A&E for such things but if local service is overrun, what choice do you have!"
Cutlers Hill,Determined to stay with this surgery,6/5/2018,4,I currently can get appointments when I need one here. I have moved house but keen to stay under this surgery as it is better than most.
Cutlers Hill,difficulty seeing GP,7/5/2016,4,It is often difficult to see my personal GP without waiting 2-3 weeks for an appointment  My GP has changed 3 times in 18 months.  The service is not as good as in Scotland where I lived for 23 years
Cutlers Hill,Doctor is fantastic,4/25/2016,5,"My own doctor is a fantastic GP. He has been so understanding of me as a new patient to the surgery. He has helped me with bladder and prostrate problems with an above average caring nature. I also have high cholesterol problems so he monitors through blood tests at the Patrick Stead Hospital, Halesworth."
Cutlers Hill,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Reliable and caring.  Don't feel rushed
Cutlers Hill,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Not had to make an appointment on the day as yet so do not know how well this system works.
Doctor seems caring and knowledgeable about you.  Waiting times are what you expect now.  Can book up to two weeks ahead"
Cutlers Hill,Excellent,5/18/2015,5,Doctors full attention and not rushed.  Also several visits to James Paget and had very good treatment.
Cutlers Hill,Excellent treatment,3/16/2017,5,I had a trigger finger and I asked for an appointment and was told to phone the next day. the doctor I saw was very annoyed that I could not see anyone the day before.  My finger was very painful and I had to have gas and air to have the finger straightened! Eventually I went to the Norfolk and Norwich hospital and I had an injection which helped.  The consultant was very kind
Cutlers Hill,Excellent.,4/26/2022,5,"No problems  with the triage service, phone calls from doctors or admin staff and receptionists. Everybody is very helpful and efficient. Considering the problems that Covid has caused over the last two years, the service has continued to be excellent."
Cutlers Hill,Excellent. Doctors take their time.,9/21/2017,5,Sometimes there is a bit of a wait in the waiting room but that is because doctors take as long as the patient needs.  Good
Cutlers Hill,Failed communication,6/4/2019,3,"I have to advocate for my parents (my father is terminally ill and my mother doesn't drive). When they need an appointment I call on their behalf and we get put on 'triage'. I always ask the surgery to call ME as I have to travel to pick them up, but they ALWAYS call mum and she gets very distressed. ""Communication breakdown"""
Cutlers Hill,Fine with getting appointments,6/5/2018,4,"As we are quite rural, it is where we go to the surgery, when we need an appointment we do however get one."
Cutlers Hill,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,5,The reception staff went above and beyond today to sort out my medication that I forgot to order. They were so helpful. What a great service.
Cutlers Hill,Generally good,2/13/2019,4,"Things are generally good here.  Only thing that needs improving is the time keeping at appointments, 30 minutes is the norm.  Just feel they could communicate that better on the check-in screens, which state things are 'on-time' when you check in."
Cutlers Hill,Get seen if urgent,7/12/2018,4,"Whenever we have needed urgent attention we have got it. If you need non-urgent appointments, yes the wait is quite long, but as it is 'non-urgent' this should be expected."
Cutlers Hill,Getting appointments can be a struggle,6/5/2018,4,This last month has been much more difficult to get an appointment than it used to be.
Cutlers Hill,Good,5/18/2015,4,"GP services, good experience"
Cutlers Hill,Good,5/18/2015,5,Husband diabetic- very good treatment/appointments/doctors & explanations.
Cutlers Hill,Good,5/18/2015,4,I find this surgery is very good and have sorted out my problems.
Cutlers Hill,Good for children appointments,7/12/2018,4,"When you need to get your children seen, they are extremely good, but not as good at getting appointments as an adult. Everyone is very lovely though"
Cutlers Hill,Good overall,2/13/2019,4,"I find the treatment here really good, although it is difficult to access when you need it.  It has to be an 'emergency' or about 6 weeks to wait."
Cutlers Hill,GP listens,4/25/2016,5,My doctor at Cutlers Hill always has time to listen and usually provides a solution.
Cutlers Hill,Great considering the challenges,10/2/2020,5,"I am fully aware of the challenges this surgery has with lack of GP's.  A national crisis, which is well known.  So under these circumstances I am extremely grateful that I do see a GP when I need to, which is rare, and on other occasions I have seen Nurses, who see to my needs, and I have never had a 're-visit' due to anything they may have missed.
Great care considering the challenges"
Cutlers Hill,Great doctors and staff.,4/4/2023,5,"Quick same day triage tel call, and appt given  that morning. The GP was kind and respectful and very thorough.  The receptionist was very courteous and understanding."
Cutlers Hill,Great doctors surgery,6/7/2019,5,Got an appointment to see a doctor within 3 weeks! Had to wait upto 8 weeks for an appointment at my old practice. Staff are friendly and very helpful.
Cutlers Hill,Great friendly service even with Covid,1/8/2021,5,Always happy to help and advise and home delivery of medication is exemplary
Cutlers Hill,Happy,5/18/2015,5,Since moving to Halesworth 4 years ago I have found the surgery to be very good. If it is urgent I speak to Triage and if necessary an appointment is issued fairly promptly. The local pharmacists are also very good.
Cutlers Hill,Happy,5/18/2015,4,really quick reaction to a need for a referral letter to a hospital followed up by an equally speedy letter explaining why the treatment was required.
Cutlers Hill,Happy,5/18/2015,5,When we have needed to be seen quickly the doctors phone back and have always seen us on the same day.
Cutlers Hill,Have been with this practice for decades,6/9/2022,5,"Only ever seen two doctors, so continuity has been great."
Cutlers Hill,Have requested phone call from Nurse,9/27/2022,1,Requested online form appointment for help with HRT. This has gone on for weeks as no phone call received. I have call register on mobile. Said phoned three times. Nothing my end. Phoned back to complain and then said would ring again nothing.. phoned again cannot offer any face to face appointment. Ring in.. however I teach so unable to do this. No help at all and desperate to talk to someone.
Cutlers Hill,Helpful most of the time when staff are available,4/2/2017,5,Why is the Patrick Stead hospital never mentioned. It's closure will impact seriously on the local community.
Cutlers Hill,Less GP's than ever,10/2/2020,4,"This surgery is struggling as we have less GP's than ever before, yet in our area we do have a high need.  I personally have seen Nurse Practitioner and Nurses, and they have been excellent.  You do trust that if you need to see a GP you will, but sometimes I worry that seeing others can be delay tactics, however I do understand why this could also happen."
Cutlers Hill,Lovely staff,10/2/2020,5,"Do not use the surgery very often, but when I have needed it, it has been excellent.  The staff are particularly lovely."
Cutlers Hill,Mixed experience,2/13/2019,4,"Seeing a nurse today to hear about blood test results, so this appointment was easy to make.  'On the day' are limited and there is only 1 GP accessible for this. Advanced for a GP you have to wait about 6 weeks, so it is quite a difficult situation.  The care is amazing.  It is just capacity."
Cutlers Hill,Never had foot assessment,7/5/2016,4,Never had foot assessment.  Seen nurse but no referral made. Had type 2 diabetes for years.
Cutlers Hill,not good,5/18/2015,2,In the NHS I find that I have to work hard to get myself the physio I need and the Occ therapy and help with the people who make splints... I can wait so long - the longer I wait the worse the problem gets.  I am suffering from a stroke.
Cutlers Hill,Not up to speed over essential prescriptions.,4/1/2023,3,"Critically needed hypertension meds not available, so just left out of my bundle!
And
Had one repeat prescription, but when asked for the following one was told doctor hadnt authorised repeat!!
In spite of the fact that I had had one already.."
Cutlers Hill,Nurses Brilliant Docs not,1/17/2022,3,"I went to the doctors to try get some more help with my osteoarthritis one doctor offered me help on the phone went in saw another Doctor, he was horrible nasty and rude felt like doing myself in after I saw him complained when asked for a review on visit this was 2 years ago never been back since just in agony every day,  62 years old received no empathy at all, as I was a Healthcare worker at the beginning of Covid-19 I also mentioned I was concerned about getting covid, he said oh another one on the Covid bandwagon rude nasty man all other staff and nurses brilliant there."
Cutlers Hill,Nurses excellent,8/27/2015,4,"Being an older person and having high blood pressure I have to visit the surgery occasionally and whilst the nurses I see are excellent, I haven't seen a doctor for over a year"
Cutlers Hill,On the day or 6 weeks,2/13/2019,4,"There is a difficulty here, as it may be at other surgeries with the term 'emergency', which means you can get an appointment on the day.  However many things do not come into that category, but if you then do not say that you can be waiting for 6 weeks which is far too long.
The term 'emergency' is really the wrong term to use.  There is a gap between needing something that day and being able to wait 6 weeks for what I usually call for.  So now I just say that I need to see someone today as I have left it a week."
Cutlers Hill,Poor,5/18/2015,1,"My husband was told someone would be sent to help with his depression.  He had had a seizure nearly 2 months before, which had an explanation, with a 3% chance of recurrence. (it never recurred until his death).  The doctor only spoke to me on the phone which was odd.  When I came back at the end of an hour the doctor spent with my husband they told my husband he had a lot of problems and would probably never drive again.  A week later the report diagnosed him with epilepsy, dementia probably Alzheimers as well as depression and Dyslexia - which I had left a note about, plus notes on another problem for discussion.  I'm sure after 50 years of marriage that I would have noticed if he had dementia.  The doctor hadn't used the notes to discuss with either of us and changed the info on it and wrote in the report as if they had been told by one of us.  This precipitated 18 months of distress to get his license back, visits to Addenbrookes to disprove diagnosis.  We couldn't understand how a 1 hour interview could get all these diagnoses.  Our GP was initially supportive and then changed and said we must have misunderstood."
Cutlers Hill,Quick referal,7/12/2018,4,"I was referred by my GP to James Paget Hospital and there was no delay, however when things did not heal as expected I got an urgent appointment with GP again and he re-referred me and I was seen very quickly. So I consider the surgery to be very supportive."
Cutlers Hill,Remote LIVI gp telephone consultation,5/4/2023,1,Rang surgery for appointment. They later called back to say telephone consultation would take place that morning with  a LIVI remote gp.  Call did take place but telephone line was so bad I suspect dr wasn’t in the uk.  At the end of the call I was no wiser as to the diagnosis.
Cutlers Hill,Ring back didn't happen,7/12/2018,3,"Trying to get an appointment is a challenge. My GP asked to see me in November and was supposed to call me, I never got the call. When I popped in the surgery in the New Year (2018) the reception re-booked the telephone appointment, and the doctor still hadn't called. Yet it was the GP saying they needed to see me.
I finally get an appointment for 6 weeks time (today) and I am 40 minutes past the time, though when I checked in it said all was running on time."
Cutlers Hill,Supportive,7/12/2018,5,This practice has been so supportive of us as a family. My child's need for assessments around her mental health have always been thorough. They leave no stone unturned.
Cutlers Hill,System could be improved,6/5/2018,3,"If you need to see a GP, you now are triaged, differently though to previous triage system. I understand that system but patients need better informing of these changes."
Cutlers Hill,This surgery is struggling.,6/14/2022,3,"1. Only two GP's, same old story. Locums, and highly trained nurses and support staff all do their best, but patients no longer have a doctor that knows them. 
2. You cannot make an appointment to see a doctor. You must ring up on the day, then wait for a triage phone call, then you get assigned to someone. The impression is that unless you have an emergency, you should not be calling. Oh, and you must have your emergency before 1.00 in the afternoon.
3. My husband has vascular dementia. In the 5 years we have lived here the doctor has seen him twice for his dementia, and only because I begged for an appointment. He was at Carlton House in Lowestoft, who have also seen him  twice. We received no referrals to any support group, no information, no support. The NHS appears unable to deal with dementia at all.
4. As a carer I have recieved no care whatsoever."
Cutlers Hill,very good,9/13/2022,5,"can be seen on day if required
non urgent appointments are some time later but that is OK with me"
Cutlers Hill,very poor care,5/15/2019,1,Impossible to get an appointment with own doctor. Even long wait to see locum. Prescriptions.  lost twice by pharmacy.
Cutlers Hill,"Welcoming, friendly and well organised",5/19/2015,4,"I registered with the practice within the last year. I'm impressed with the quiet efficiency, the time allowed for appointments and facilities such as the dispensary and the blood testing service at Patrick Stead hospital. Both nurses and doctors treat you like a grown up, very refreshing."
Cutlers Hill,Well looked after,7/12/2018,5,"My GP has been excellent around my treatment. I have had numerous operations and need for regular wound changes. I can book in advance, which can take a lot of time, however they are so good at looking after me."
Cutlers Hill,Works well for me.,6/4/2019,5,"Been under this surgery for 30 years and they work so hard, you know they have challenges, but you never hear them complain about it.
I have been able to come in today and have some stitches out, rather than have to go to 'Norfolk and Norwich', so that is very convenient. Works well for me and always has."
Deben,"1 doctor, no appointment available.",10/3/2016,1,"As there was only one doctor out of six on duty and they were out on an emergency. Because they could not see me we've had to go to A & E. Normally, getting appointments is not too bad. There have been a number of doctors coming and going but the practice do not keep patients informed."
Deben,3 months to send a referral letter,1/19/2016,4,Letter was finally sent after it was chased. When asked why this happened I was informed that I'd have to make a formal complaint to get an apology if it was their fault. Who is at fault isn't up for dispute. The info was received it just wasn't forwarded
Deben,4 star,5/8/2015,4,4 star
Deben,57 years a patient here!,1/23/2019,4,I have been a patient here for 57 years so it must suit me! It could be a bit easier to get an appointment.  But I suppose that is just down to demand. The nurse practitioner is lovely-so reassuring and professional. Otherwise I wouldn’t want to change very much other than the wait for appointments. I won’t have any problem with getting to the new site as long as there is a car park.
Deben,A week and a half for a routine appointment,8/3/2019,4,It takes a week and a bit for a routine appointment. I am thinking of transferring to another practice which is closer to me so I won't be transferring when they move.
Deben,A week's wait for an appt.,9/26/2017,4,At least a weeks wait for an appointment which can feel along time.
Deben,All good.,1/23/2019,5,"I find this surgery very good. Everything works well for me. Appointments, repeat prescriptions-all good. Only slight thing is I am never seen on time, usually it is only 10-15 minutes but I have waited 45. I welcome the move to new premises, this building isn’t really weak=ll suited for the purpose it services. The upstairs consulting rooms aren’t very accessible. I won’t have any transport difficulties in getting to the Tooks site) as my husband drives me."
Deben,Always been here,11/12/2018,5,My family and I have always been registered here and we have always been very happy-no issues. We can get appointments and although we never see the same doctor twice they all seem very competent as do the nurse practitioners. The new site will be more convenient for us than this one so the sooner the better as far as we are concerned.
Deben,Always been pretty good.,2/27/2019,4,I have been registered here for a few years now and it has always been pretty good. They have always been ok with referrals and with letters to the hospital. I drive so I will go to the new site with the practice but I hope there will be a courtesy bus service for those who don't drive.
Deben,Always happy when I do need to attend,1/23/2019,4,I don’t come to the surgery any more than I have to. I use self help methods and the pharmacist to minimise visits here. I am always happy with the service that I get when I do need to come though. I usually see the nurse practitioner and she is very thorough and listens carefully to me when I describe my symptoms. There are no problems here for me. I will be able to get to the proposed Tooks site fairly easily so I just hope the service will be as good as it is here.
Deben,Always responsive and feel I get quality care,9/12/2020,5,Always get through for appointments. Appointments punctual and feel I am.listened to.
Deben,Always treated with courtesy and sympathy.,11/5/2020,5,Care navigators are helpful and knowledgeable. I have always managed to see my GP when needed and they are very thorough.
Deben,Appointment,4/14/2018,2,Absolute nightmare now to get appointment have to book weeks ahead to see a doctor. Receptionist makes you feel very uncomfortable and ask too many questions you are made to feel uncomfortable when trying to get an appointment
Deben,Appointment system,1/30/2018,3,Feel they just want you 'in & out'. appointments are hard to get as they have 2 slots.In the morning it is hard to get through but when you do they won't book you in for the afternoon. You have to then call again at lunchtime and then most the appointments are gone too. It is really annoying.
Deben,appointments aren't a big issue,8/3/2019,3,"I have to say that I don't think I have ever been seen on time and I have been a patient here since my birth (32 years) Appointments aren't a big issue, not all are 'on the day' so I can get a routine one when I need one. It doesn't feel a 'friendly' place here anymore though  that said I will transfer to the new site with them when they go."
Deben,Appointments sometimes feel too short,8/9/2017,3,"I would like more time in appointments, for the Doctors and Nurses to have time to listen to me, and for me to know they are seeing me as an individual. Some are very good and others seem to be watching the clock."
Deben,Appointments/ medication,9/23/2018,2,Couldn't get appointment for my problem despite being ongoing for weeks. Dealt with over phone by nurse practitioner who sent prescription to local pharmacy incorrectly twice only sorted when pharmacist got involved otherwise I would have paid for two prescriptions to get 6 capsules! Very disappointed
Deben,Attitude is usually very good,1/23/2019,5,"I have been a patient here for 71 years - all my life. Happy with doctors and nurses but, although overall attitudes are usually very good, some reception staff can come over as a bit obstructive sometimes. Also it would be nice to have a bit of music on in the waiting room-it feels a bit like a morgue sometimes. The proposed Tooks site is no further from where I live so there won’t be any transport issues for us. It all looks very good on the artists impression!"
Deben,"Awful, woeful, despicable",1/10/2020,1,"I am absolutely appalled by the staff and doctors at this surgery now. I had to call them repeatedly because of a fault with my phone (not of my doing) and they seem to blame me for this. My doctor conveniently cut me off the phone and I am now number 7 in the queue. 
I have been a patient there since I was born and I have never felt so unhappy and infuriated with the service. I am changing doctors surgery and registering with another surgery.
I appreciate and realise that there is a serious co-vid outbreak and have been very patient in waiting for my conditions to be dealt with. But they are getting worse. 
Avoid."
Deben,Because of thoroughness,11/12/2018,3,Some of the doctors typically run late.  I realise that is because of thoroughness but my issue is that I need to be back at work. It seems to me that there are only on the day appointments or 2-3 weeks delay. The doctors themselves seem very professional and competent. I am happy at the prospect of a move to new premises as travel wouldn't be a problem for me.
Deben,Brilliant Communication,10/31/2017,5,They were brilliant.  Talked through everything; very reassuring
Deben,Brilliant surgery,10/10/2019,5,"Pleasant staff and excellent doctors who are very kind, understanding and sympathetic."
Deben,Brilliant!,8/3/2019,5,This practice is brilliant! My wife (now deceased) and myself moved down here from Norfolk seven years ago to be closer to our daughter and we registered here then. The service is so much better than the practice we attended in Norfolk and I will certainly move with them to the new site.
Deben,"Call times, prescription issues",8/12/2020,3,"Before Deben Road merged it offered a quick and responsive service. Now the call wait times are way to long. I seems to have lost its personal touch. 
Once you then get a phone or actual appointment you can wait 2/3 weeks. 
Prescription's I understand have been difficult during the pandemic because of supply issues, however the Morrison Pharmacy were  much more accommodating and knowledgeable in finding a suitable alternative. 
It certainly doesn't feel like the community led surgery of past days.
The Nurse practitioners are fantastic and my preference to see over current GPs."
Deben,can get appointments ok,12/13/2017,4,Rang up for an appointment to have a flu jab and got one in the week. Normally can get appointments ok and even if you don't get to see a doctor they will try to get you in to see a nurse. Parking is difficult.
Deben,Can take long time to see own GP,9/26/2017,3,"To make an appt. with a specific doctor takes a long time, can be a couple of weeks, which feels too long."
Deben,Cannot get an appointment.,10/3/2016,2,"You can't make advanced appointments at all and have to phone on the day for one. I called Friday for an apt but couldn't be seen until 4.15 which was too late due to the issue. They advised I call 111 to see if they could get someone out so see me. Generally, getting appts is very difficult and they do seem to have staffing problems at the moment. If you call on the day they do try to get you to see a nurse practitioner."
Deben,Can't get much better than this!,2/27/2019,4,I have been a patient here my whole life. I called in yesterday with a problem and I have an appointment today and then a hospital appointment this afternoon. You can't get much better than that! I drive and will happily move with the practice to the new location.
Deben,Cinically it is fine,11/12/2018,3,There is an online booking system but I can't remember my user number which is long and complicated so I 'phone in. My lower overall marks reflect the issues with getting through and securing an appointment. Clinically they are fine.
Deben,Close by me,11/16/2016,2,I am newly arrived in the Country with very little English. Suffolk Refugee Support (SRS) book all my doctor appointments. When I was pregnant I went to the doctors with stomach pain. They sent me home and booked me into the hospital for a scan the next day. When I got home the pain got worse and I was bleeding so called an ambulance. When I got to hospital I miscarried. They surgery is near where I live which is good. I use Language Line. Sometimes it isn't very good as they cannot see what I am talking about. Sometimes I do not get the medicine I think I should have.
Deben,Communicating with patients,6/6/2017,3,"I did not know until recently, that my surgery is going to close by 2020. Most of the time my appointment has ran late."
Deben,Complete faith in new doctors,12/14/2017,5,"Old doctors have left the surgery. Fingers and hands were locked and they referred me to an appointment at the hospital. New doctors at the surgery are very good, the referral was in good timing. Rarely visit in general."
Deben,Constant different doctors,7/12/2020,3,You don’t see the same doctor who has no background on your state of health and well-being
Deben,Constant different doctors,7/12/2020,3,You don’t see the same doctor who has no background on your state of health and well-being
Deben,Could be more understanding,8/9/2017,3,"Having been referred to a service outside the surgery and then not having made any progress with this treatment, I then returned to my doctor and didn't find them to be understanding."
Deben,Difficult to get appointments,5/28/2016,3,it's difficult to get an appointment
Deben,Difficulties hearing and understanding staff,6/22/2016,3,I wear hearing aids and I find it difficult to understand staff and they struggle to understand me.  Waiting times can be between 10-30 minutes but this isn't bad. I like the fact that they put my name on the board and other patients will help me. Sometimes I do not fully understand the explanations given but depending on the doctor some will give me written notes to take home.
Deben,Do not need lectures on what can’t be helped,5/21/2021,2,"Called the docs to get appointment for my little boy as he constantly getting bronch, he gets it whenever he gets a cold so needed advice on what to do/ how best to handle it when it happens. My telephone appointment was rescheduled three times and when the docs did call it was 45 mins later than the expected time. 

Doc went through everything (his birth, history of ashthma etc) and in the end basically said nothing they can do (which I’m ok with as now it’s on little ones records that he still suffers with them - his first bout of bronch ended up in hospital at 8 weeks old) but then the docs proceeded to give me a lecture on how I should have breastfed both of my child as I could have given them the best start/antibodies and helped build their immune system up and breast is best. 

Firstly it’s a mother’s choice as to which she does and there may have been reasons as to why I didn’t breastfeed, secondly motherhood is a very judgmental role - we also don’t need it from the docs too and thirdly had this conversation of been with me 3 weeks ago god knows how I would have reacted because I’ve been coming off my antidepressants for postnatal depression - be considerate of the person you are speaking with. I can’t change what I did/ didn’t do and I don’t need a lecture to make me feel like I’m to blame for my little ones getting poorly. 

Overall I found the experience very upsetting and left the conversation feeling guilty and frustrated."
Deben,Doctors are so professional,1/23/2019,4,Some of the people on the (reception) desk can be a bit rude but not all of them. The loos are sometimes not very clean and the decor in the waiting room is overdue a facelift. That said the doctors and nurses are pleasant and professional and I guess that is the most important thing. I drive so I think the new premises at Tooks will be a real bonus for me.
Deben,Doctors listen,8/9/2017,5,The doctors staff listen to me and get things sorted quickly.
Deben,Don’t feel I’m listening to about,8/12/2020,3,Whilst sympathetic on the phone i don't really get any treatment i need to ease the pain I’m in. Sometimes I feel I’m being a nuisance..
Deben,Efficient and Caring,4/12/2020,5,I waited on the phone for a few minutes and when the receptionist answered she listened to my concerns and arranged a telephone appointment with a doctor. The doctor phoned me and we discussed my concerns. As this did not reach a diagnosis and we both had some concerns she arranged for a face to face appointment.. You can't ask for better service. Thank you
Deben,Everything else is fine,1/23/2019,5,There can be a slight delay in being seen (after the appointment time) but in all honesty everything else is fine so I can live with that. I walk to the surgery but the new premises won’t be too far and it looks very good.
Deben,Everything is good except reception,8/3/2019,5,"Everything is pretty good here apart from the attitude of some of the reception staff. I make an appointment to see the same doctor every time, it takes a bit longer but I value them and think it is worth the extra few days. I would like to go to the new practice when it opens but I will only be able to do that if the bus service is improved."
Deben,excellent,8/31/2017,5,Overall a very good surgery.  Appointments can run behind but in the main OK.
Deben,excellent,8/31/2017,5,Overall very good. Staff can vary. In the main my appointments have run to time
Deben,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,Always been really good.  Can usually get appointment a week in advance
Deben,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,Overall really good.  However on one occasion when I was told to see my own GP on a Friday I was told to call on the Monday.  When I did that they said my GP was only taking emergency appointments so I had to see a nurse practitioner
Deben,excellent,8/31/2017,5,"I have been coming here for years, things have had to change, but I can still see a GP when I need to, so they are doing a good job."
Deben,excellent,8/24/2017,5,Appointments running late and unable to get them easily.  When you get to see the GP/Nurse all is wonderful.
Deben,excellent,8/24/2017,5,Find the surgery excellent.  I do not often use it.  It is good that the nurses see you for the things that you do not need to see a GP for.
Deben,excellent,8/24/2017,5,Getting an appointment very difficult but we get a letter in advance for a review.  I find seeing nurse practiitioner good
Deben,Excellent,7/8/2017,5,Problem getting blood but sorted eventually.
Deben,Excellent,1/8/2017,5,"Fine surgery, great staff."
Deben,Excellent and staff very helpful.,7/8/2017,5,"Staff at Deben Road have been very helpful and kind in sorting medications post surgery, both today but also last week over the phone."
Deben,Excellent care,5/26/2020,5,(Name removed) is a godsend to the surgery! He takes the time to listen to you properly and I never feel rushed or silly
Deben,Excellent care,5/25/2020,5,My Dr is a godsend to the surgery! He takes the time to listen to you properly and I never feel rushed or silly
Deben,Excellent service always,6/5/2020,5,"Never had a problem getting an appointment, friendly practice staff, efficient"
Deben,Fair,8/24/2017,3,Getting an appointment to see a specific GP can now take a month.  On the day appointments go so fast it is very difficult.  I think the new surgery should help with this.
Deben,"Friendly staff, good treatment",8/9/2017,5,"The Surgery has friendly staff, they listen to me and I've had good treatment"
Deben,Generally very happy here,11/12/2018,4,I don't have a problem with getting appointments and I am usually seen on time (though a bit late today). I rate the clinical team very highly in terms of their knowledge and professionalism and I am generally very happy here. I won't have any practical difficulties with the move to the Tooks site.
Deben,Glad to be with this Surgery,8/9/2017,4,I've been a patient with the Deben Road Surgery for many years and pleased to be in their care.
Deben,Good,8/31/2017,4,Find it easy to get an appointment.  Running late today by over half an hour.
Deben,good,8/31/2017,4,Once you see GP/nurse all is good.  Things just tend to be behind even at the beginning of the day
Deben,good,7/3/2019,4,"Doctor always faces patient, who has disabilities, so feels respected"
Deben,Good,7/3/2019,4,Good but had to wait for appointment both at the surgery and at Ipswich hospital
Deben,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Friendly doctors, always seen on time.  To sign in its on a computer so a lot easier and time effective.  Sometimes hard to book an appointment though."
Deben,Good but seeing specific doctor is difficult,1/11/2016,4,To see a specific doctor takes about 2 weeks and I would worry that if I had an ongoing issue.  Seeing the same doctor helps with continuity.  The care and staff have all been very good.  Sometimes the receptionists can be a bit abrupt.  I was told to have a flu jab by my doctor but when I tried to book I was told none were available.  When I said the doctor had requested it she said that I could have an appointment next week
Deben,Good explanations and caring doctor.,7/8/2017,4,All good. Everything was explained about my condition. A very caring doctor.
Deben,Good service everything clearly explained,8/9/2017,5,"All around good service, as a diabetic they explain everything very clearly, brilliant."
Deben,Good with children but some staff are abrupt,9/26/2017,5,"Someone on reception can be abrupt. The Surgery is very good with children, always able to get an appt. for the children very quickly. A Practice Nurse and a Doctor that we see are very good."
Deben,"Good, some staff could communicate better",9/26/2017,4,"Overall very good surgery and service, just a couple of staff who could be better at saying things in a nicer way."
Deben,Good. Getting appointments fine,4/5/2017,4,Very good when trying to get the children an appointment the same day.  Only see the nurse practitioner who is good.  When you call you are given one appointment option but if you can't make it you are not offerred another appointment but told back the next day
Deben,Help if appointments were on ground floor,9/26/2017,3,"I find having consultation rooms upstairs a challenge, especially as there isn't a lift. The recorded message I listen to when telephoning the surgery is I think inappropriate and needs changing."
Deben,I am recently registered.,12/17/2018,3,I am recently registered here having moved to the area from elsewhere. The registration process was fairly straightforward but this is my first visit to see a clinician. That said I am 30 minutes late being called in so far (and still waiting).
Deben,I am so angry! refused re-registration,6/18/2016,4,my daughter went off ro Uni but stayed on the electoral roll. When she returned we wanted her to be re-registered here as she had been before she went away. They refused to take her. I was so angry when she needed medication.
Deben,I can't complain overall,8/3/2019,4,"I find both doctors and nurses to be ok-some are good, some less so. Appointments have never been an issue for me. The waiting room is a bit dark and shabby but usually clean enough. I will move to new site with the practice, the car parking will be a great improvement!"
Deben,I don't like sharing info with/at Reception,9/26/2017,5,"I shouldn't have to go into detail with the receptionist about why I need to see the doctor. The reception is a public area unsuitable for sharing my personal information, and the receptionists aren't nurses or doctors."
Deben,I don't like the single illness rule,2/27/2019,4,"I have been a patient here since 1954 and I currently drive so I will move to the new location as and when the surgery moves.I don't like the 10 minute, one illness rule which means I have to book another appointment. I don't see the same doctor or nurse twice but that seems to be a more general thing from what friends and family tell me. I think they are pretty good overall though."
Deben,I dont want to travel to other surgeries,8/12/2020,4,"I dont see why I should have to start travelling around to other surgeries at this time, Deben road has been my surgery for about 50 years, when you go to your own surgery you get used to seeing your own doctor and I am concerned that if I have to go to the other surgeries you are seeing completely different doctors and they dont really know me and would be lack of consistency of the same doctor. I hope the surgeries do not merge."
Deben,I like going to just one surgery,8/12/2020,3,"I dont like the idea of the 3 surgeries amalgamating together as I like the idea of being seen at one surgery as you get to know the staff and they get to know you,concerned about lack of consistency of service, and the personal touch. There could be transport issues for some people."
Deben,I see nurse practitioners,2/26/2019,4,The reception staff's telephone manner can be less than good but I now realise (following explanation from HWS operative) that this is part of Care Navigation. I usually see nurse practitioners and they are often running a bit late but that's ok as they look after me pretty well. When the practice re-locates I will move with it as I drive.
Deben,I’m happy with my care,1/23/2019,4,I see different doctors/nurses each time I come. They all seem pretty well ok though so no complaints on that score. I don’t really come here that often but I don’t think I have ever been seen on time though that hasn’t really been a problem for me. I won’t have any problem getting to the proposed new site and the building is very impressive in the pictures. All looks good to me.
Deben,impossible to get through to,9/22/2020,1,"Apppointments not available on line anymore.  Wrong telephone number on the web page to ring to make an appointment for a flu vaccination!

Took over 15 minutes to get through to make an appointment!!!!!

Lack on communication with patients.

IS THIS PRACTICE CLOSING DOWN??"
Deben,Inconvenient prescription renewal,5/22/2017,4,Now have to get my prescription renewed monthly rather than 2 monthly. This must take more time and money for the practice
Deben,It is local to me,1/23/2019,4,"This surgery is local to me, I live on Whitehouse and I walk in for appointments. It will be harder to get to the new place. It will be a long journey for me particularly if I’m not feeling well."
Deben,It's difficult to get an appointment,5/28/2016,3,It is difficult to get an appointment with a GP. Always get a nurse practitioner. Receptionists ask what is wrong!
Deben,I've been here for 19 years,12/17/2018,4,"It is a bit dark and shabby here now-it has been a while since it was decorated. Seats are stained as well. Operationally I can be a bit late being called in to my appointments even if the waiting room is quiet, which is a bit strange. I have been a patient here for 19 years but now I don't usually see the same doctor twice in a row which isn't great. Generally though I am pretty satisfied with how I am looked after. With regard to the practice move as long as there is parking at the new site I will have no problem with the new location."
Deben,I've never had any sort of problem.,12/17/2018,5,"I won't have any access problems following the move go the Took's site as I already drive to my appointments. I've never had any problems here, I phone in and they sort me out. I am given information, leaflets and booklets to help me manage my own health which I value. My whole family comes here and we are all happy with how it works for us."
Deben,Lack of care for the elderly,8/30/2016,1,"I moved my mother from this practice, due to her being left in agony with undiagnosed infection, it was only after my insistence that she was admitted to hospital, where they immediately knew what was wrong with her, they could not believe that she had been left to get so bad."
Deben,Liking everything,9/26/2017,5,I like everything about this surgery
Deben,Listen and explain well,8/9/2017,5,"Just lately they have been very good to me, they listen and explain things well. When I needed hospital care they arranged for it to happen quickly."
Deben,Long wait for appointment.,10/3/2016,4,Some staff have not been overly sympathetic when I've been trying to get appointments and I was offered an appt in two weeks time. I tried to see someone today but was told 'no appts were available try tomorrow'. Instead I've gone to A & E.
Deben,Longer wait than I would like,9/26/2017,4,"Friendly staff, waiting longer than I would like."
Deben,must be short staffed,7/3/2019,2,"Access to this surgery is so limited.
I called for 40 minutes with no-one picking up and when they finally did there were no appointments. Then you have to do it all over again for the afternoon appointments. 
It's just so difficult to get to see someone, they must be so short of staff."
Deben,My doctor is fantastic,1/23/2019,5,"I have COPD and my doctor is fantastic - she really goes the extra mile for me. I have been a patient here all of my life and it hasn’t really changed much. Building isn’t so good anymore with the growing demand so I think the planned new building (at the Tooks site) is a good thing, there isn’t any parking here so that should improve."
Deben,My doctor is great,12/17/2018,4,I am happy to wait (a bit longer for an appointment) to see one particular doctor. She is great and she knows me and my condition. I hope I will still be able to see her after the practice move to the Took's site. I will want to stay registered with the practice and attend the new site. It won't be any further for me than the journey now.
Deben,My whole family is registered here,2/27/2019,5,I have been a patient here for 29 years. My whole family is registered here and they look after us well. I am sometimes a bit late going in and the waiting room could do with a bit of a spruce up. The new premises will be neared to me that this location so we will all move (four people) no problem.
Deben,Nigh on impossible to get an appointment,7/3/2018,2,That's if you can get past the receptionist and if you do very rare you see a GP
Deben,No referral made although promised,8/9/2017,2,"I've been going to the Surgery for 8 months with the same problem, not helped seeing different people, I was told I'd be referred to the hospital and then when I looked into why nothing had happened it turned out no referral had been made."
Deben,No worries about the move,1/23/2019,4,I don’t have any worries about the proposed move to the Tooks site - in fact is will be better for me provided there is parking as I drive to my appointments. Apart from never being seen on time here everything else about the practice is good. The nurse practitioners are brilliant and they run more to time as well.
Deben,Not a service cant see gp and cant get app,6/24/2021,1,"Waiting for a gp to call me since thursday. It's now thursday, so a week later about my hay fever breathlessness and the need for eye drops that they will not prescribe as I can get them over the counter. Been to 6 pharmacies, they all say I need a prescription. I just give up with this place looking for a different surgery."
Deben,Not easy access for me using a frame,9/26/2017,5,"I need doors that have a push button beside them. As I use a frame to walk this would make a big difference to me, and others."
Deben,not easy to get an appointment,12/5/2015,3,"it is not easy to get an appointment but whenever you visit the surgery is always empty. The reception staff seemed to run the surgery not the doctors, Once through to the doctors  they are very good."
Deben,Not in depth enough,11/12/2018,3,I am now over 90 years old and I have a couple of chronic conditions. Some reception staff are very nice but some a a bit 'matter of fact' in my experience. I feel that when I am with a doctor or nurse practitioner that the consultations are not in sufficient depth. I don't feel they get down to the underlying issues. The move to the proposed building on the old Took's site will be more convenient for me because it is closer to where I live.
Deben,Not to impressed.,11/30/2017,1,"Me and my partner have been patients at this surgery for a lot years now and overall the surgery is ok. But when it comes to requesting repeat prescriptions the system is very unreliable. I have lost count of the times i have gone to pick up mine or my partners prescriptions only to find the surgery has either lost the request, missed items off or just not bothered to put them through the system back to the chemist. I have today had another wasted journey to the chemist only to find that at the last minute they want to reveiw some of the pills my partner is on and the prescription wont be ready till this afternoon. after being promised yesterday after another wasted journey that the prescription would be ready to pick up this morning. The surgery really needs to sort this problem out it can end up leaving patients with out important medication!!! we always order way before the meds are needed because of all the mess ups in the past!!"
Deben,"not very helpful, no home visit",12/17/2019,1,"my dad was due to have blood tests today, he has gout at the minute and cant get shoes or slippers on at the moment, dont they have district nurses anymore, they could have come to his to take his bloods?"
Deben,Nurse helpfully calm,5/31/2016,4,I was a bit annoyed as I didn't want my injection but as the nurse stayed calm it was okay.
Deben,"Nurse practitioner is excellent, otherwise not so good",6/18/2016,3,the nurse practitioner is excellent. However the appointment system is atrocious and receptionists can be rude. I want to move surgery but I think most of the others maybe just as bad
Deben,Nurse practitioners are good,11/12/2018,4,"Nurse practitioners here are good, I rate their medical knowledge. They also run closer to time than the doctors and are easier to get an appointment with. This is a friendly place but has got busier over the years. I have been a patient all my life and the increased demand on the practice is obvious. I still drive, so the proposed move to the Tooks site is fine by me so as long as appointments for Deben Road patients (as opposed to co-located practice patients) are protected."
Deben,nurses are great,8/3/2019,4,"Mostly when I come in I see one of the nurses, they are great. I think that appointments are reasonably available and I rate the service that I get here. The proposed new site is a bit further away but I will transfer when they move as I think the local alternatives are not as good as here from what I hear,"
Deben,One or two staff could be friendlier,9/26/2017,4,There are one or two staff who could be more friendly when they communicate.
Deben,"Otherwise, pretty good",2/26/2019,3,I have been a patient here for about 40 years. I am usually seen late with no apology given but otherwise the service is pretty good. The new site (Took's) is no further from where I live and so there will be no problem with me getting there and I will transfer with the practice.
Deben,Out of their hands,1/23/2019,3,"We have been patients here for a number of years and we rate the doctors and nurses highly. It seems very difficult to get an appointment now, the wait on the telephone seems very long, it all seems less accessible than it used to be. Reception try their best (when you are through to them) but it is out of their hands sometimes. Neither of us drive so the journey up to Tooks will be a bit of a problem. I don’t know what I will do when they move."
Deben,Paramedic is absolutely brilliant,11/12/2018,5,The paramedic does home visits and he is absolutely brilliant!! I have mobility problems so I need my appointments to be on the ground floor and that doesn't always happen. Also I have struggled sometimes when my medication has been altered by my consultant at the hospital but the practice doesn't seem to either receive or possibly act on the changes.
Deben,poor,9/30/2019,2,Difficult to get an appointment. Always told to call back in the morning but line constantly engaged!  Receptionists not friendly
Deben,Poor in comparrison to my old surgery,6/21/2021,2,No continuity of care. Each time you speak to someone different.
Deben,Poor quality service,6/22/2021,2,Lack of communication and quality of care missing since the merger
Deben,Prefer nurse practitioners,11/12/2018,3,"When I phone for an appointment the receptionists ask a lot of intrusive questions and their attitude can be 'miserable'. I understand the idea of triage to most appropriate services but my experience when my son was unwell with tonsillitis we didn't get an on the day appointment so he deteriorated and ended up in hospital very unwell with quinsy which I believe was due to a decision by a medically untrained receptionist. I don't want to be made to feel a burden when I ring up. I prefer nurse practitioners to doctors, they are more accessible. I think the practice would benefit from having more specialist practitioners. There used to be a doctor who have cortisone injections, he left and hasn't been replaced (by someone with similar skills) plus I don't think the clinicians generally are good with children on the autism spectrum."
Deben,prescription request are a nightmare,7/12/2020,1,"As a long term pain patient, tablets are a life changing help. Messing about with the requests by different drs not knowing my full info and questioning my meds which are strong pain killers and nerve blockers, holds up the reissue regularly have been without meds on a lot of times which is really bad painwise and effects my daily life, which is poor most days."
Deben,Pretty good overall,2/27/2019,4,"I've been registered here for a while and never had any difficulty that springs to mind. Nurses and doctors that I have seen have all been fine. So,overall it has been pretty good. I will go to Took's when the surgery re-locates. It is not much further and closer than re-registering at another surgery."
Deben,Really hard to get help,9/17/2020,2,Not easy now to get appointment or even a telephone consultation. Very disappointed been waiting 9 hours for call back
Deben,Receptionist not at desk all the time.,6/3/2019,4,Would like Receptionist to attend at desk at all time. Not have to ring a bell.
Deben,registration was straightforward,2/27/2019,3,This is my first visit as I have recently moved to Ipswich and needed a new surgery. I found the registration very straightforward and the staff involved were helpful. I do drive so I will move to the new site with the practice when it relocates.
Deben,Repeat prescriptions a nightmare,2/16/2021,1,"Requested a repeat prescription but after a week it hadn’t been sent through to the pharmacy so had to contact the surgery only to be told that she had been off sick! Is there only one person dealing with prescriptions ? More importantly they hadn’t dealt with a new item that had been requested by the hospital, apparently they had a backlog of communication from the hospital, took over a week to sort out with numerous phone calls, trips to the pharmacy hoping that the new item had been sent through, only once the hospital got involved did they resolve the problem, my husband had almost run out of very important eye drops for his glaucoma, terrible service"
Deben,Requests for repeat prescriptions often delay,12/14/2020,1,Always having to chase up delayed or incomplete prescriptions. No repore with doctors as you never see or talk to the same one twice.
Deben,Rubbish. Can’t get through to them.,10/11/2020,1,Mum saw nurse practitioner and was misdiagnosed. This is the second time it’s happened. Appalling and no doctor seems to stay
Deben,Rude and useless,12/2/2019,1,"Heavily pregnant, with many gallstones symptoms and family history of the issue, 2 doctors and a nurse practitioner refuse to test and will blame everything you say on pregnancy."
Deben,Rude and useless,12/2/2019,1,"Heavily pregnant, with many gallstones symptoms and family history of the issue, 2 doctors and a nurse practitioner refuse to test and will blame everything you say on pregnancy."
Deben,Service going downhill,9/12/2020,4,"Getting shunted around to Chesterfield Drive and Norwich Road surgeries is not good for care, especially when have experienced a mis-diagnosis by Chesterfield Drive surgery. The plan to merge these practices is not going to be good for patient care and will become more difficult for patients without transport - even more so with the planned move to the former Tooks Bakery site."
Deben,Some clinical staff seem in a hurry,8/9/2017,4,"When I've seen a Nurse Practitioner I've felt I had the the time I needed, but then in my appt. with another Clinician they came across as everything being in a hurry, I came away feeling I'd been an inconvenience."
Deben,Some staff can come across as abrupt & long wait for appointments,9/26/2017,5,"Sometimes the staff on reception can come across as being short with me, this happened recently and I was then only doing what the nurse had asked me to. Appointments can take up to two weeks to come through."
Deben,sometimes in and out in 5 minutes,2/27/2019,4,I find that the nurses don't demonstrate compassion-I have been in and out in less than five minutes-that's not long enough to get all my needs articulated. I don't feel that I am properly listened to and it has delayed my medical progress. I have had to escalate myself to a GP to get sorted. All of that said I will move with the practice because I think it is better than the alternatives locally.
Deben,"Sometimes, staff can be a little abrupt",8/9/2017,4,"Sometimes, some of the staff can come across as being a little bit abrupt."
Deben,Speaking to some of the staff Is awful.,9/11/2020,1,Some of the receptionists are unsympathetic and unhelpful.
Deben,Staff members helpfulness can vary,12/17/2015,4,Some members of staff can be really helpful but others are less so and can be abrupt when dealing with you.
Deben,Stop giving me the nurse practitioner.,6/5/2018,1,"3 separate ailments I have been told nothing is wrong by nurse practitioner.
All 3 Times have been issues once I went private and I had a real problem."
Deben,Taken 73 minutes to get through,7/12/2020,1,First call I was in a queue for 44 minutes only to get cut off when I was No 1 in the queue then phoned again only to wait another 29 minutes to be asked to phone in a few days as she didn’t know when the next flu clinic was.
Deben,terrible service takes 20 minutes on phone,9/16/2020,1,absolutely terrible service takes over 20 minutes just to get through and book a nurse appointment - left queueing on the phone and not moving forward- service gone completely downhill since one doctor left. terrible terrible service.
Deben,The doctors are mostly fine,8/3/2019,3,Our family have all been registered here for ages but they don't seem as efficient (administration wise) as they used to be. I have one particular issue which I haven't been able to resolve. I can make an appointment for my mother but not for my 17 year old daughter! I don't think much of the attitude of some (not all) of the reception staff but the doctors and nurses themselves are all fine. I (and my family) will move with the practice.
Deben,The surgery is excellent,7/16/2015,5,My surgery is excellent. Always get an appointment every time I ring. Very empathetic. Nurse Practitioners are excellent. Overall rate my surgery 10/10
Deben,They are so organised,12/17/2018,5,They are so organised and they care here. This wasn't the case in my previous surgery. I think it is all fantastic but my doctor goes above and beyond for me when I was poorly. I hope this high level of quality service continues after the move to Took's. I am happy to attend there as it will be purpose built and not as 'warren like' as this place.
Deben,They do the best with what they have got,11/12/2018,4,"They do the best with what they have got in view of the big demand. Priorities exist and I understand that some people have greater needs and their care needs to be promoted. With regard to the relocation, I live mid way between these premises and Tooks so I won't have a problem."
Deben,They do well,8/3/2019,4,My 3 stars for waiting at appointment might be a bit harsh-I am later today than is usual. In fact I think they do well given the restrictions imposed by the current premises. Ordinary (routine appointments) with any doctor are good but it can take between 2-3 weeks to see a specific clinician. I am pretty happy overall and I will definitely move with the practice to the new premises when they are open.
Deben,Too long wait time for making appointments,2/17/2018,3,The repeat prescription system does not work and staff cannot correct it   example tablets 1 a day issued in December cannot 're order until March 28 tablets for 90 days does not equal 1 a day
Deben,Totally changed for the worst of experiences!,5/16/2021,1,"I am a patient with quite alot of health problems and since my doctor, who I would always try to see, has gone there just doesn't seem to be that care and support there once was. I have been a patient here for 36 years and have been made to feel in the last 2 years as if I didn't matter and was nothing but a number on a piece of paper to hurry along.

This is supposed to be a caring profession but since several doctors have all left it has gone more and more downhill, you never know who you may talk to or see. There's no information about ANY of the DRS and every time you speak to someone different who I've never heard of. It always seems such a bother to have a double app because that's what I have to do if I want to talk about more than one thing which is common for someone who has a number of health conditions. 

Just not happy here anymore."
Deben,Trying to get appointment,11/8/2020,3,"Really gone downhill, feel there is a lack of GPs"
Deben,Trying to get through by phone is impossible,10/22/2020,3,"I'm trying to phone for a flu jab - every time I try I'm in a queue that is so slow to go down - 15 minutes sat at number 3 in the queue last time.
Just now I was no 1 in the queue for over 10 minutes then the line just went dead. 
I do not have the time or mobile credit to keep on trying to get through so I guess I'll just have to risk not getting a flu jab."
Deben,Unable to contact by phone and a useless email,6/28/2021,1,I need to speak with a doctor about previous condition and medication
Deben,Unhelpful receptionists,11/28/2020,1,"When asked by the doctor to go downstairs and make an urgent blood test l was unable to do so, the receptionists insisted that l would have to return home and telephone reception to do this"
Deben,Usually appointment can be booked quickly.,10/27/2017,5,Can usually get an appointment quickly.  The staff are always polite.  Doctor and staff knowledgeable and signpost to other relevant services.
Deben,Usually helpful,9/26/2017,3,Usually I find most staff helpful.
Deben,Very compassionate & supportive clinical staff,8/9/2017,5,"Regular visitor to the Surgery, clinical staff are very compassionate and very supportive."
Deben,very friendly and efficient,2/1/2021,5,I was able to see a doctor within a few days
Deben,Very good all round,8/3/2019,4,"I am nearly 80 now and I am coming here more and more frequently unfortunately-it is very good all round. I would value being able to see the same doctor on each visit but I think that is a thing of the past now and not just at this practice. I still drive and I value the quality of the service here so I will transfer when they move, I don't have any issues with that."
Deben,Very good considering demand,1/23/2019,5,In terms of the current site/staff it all works very well for me. It is very good considering the huge demands now. Timeliness isn’t always 100% but I totally understand why this would be the case. I drive so I won’t have any access difficulties with the proposed new site and the impression of the building looks very impressive!
Deben,"very good. find staff nearly always helpful,",2/5/2019,5,"contacted surgery as needed strong painkillers after op. and received a text saying prescription was at pharmacy for collection . another time when stating my husbands symptoms to receptionist I was put through to a doctor and advised to phone ambulance,He had suffered a T.I.A. although he did not have usual noticeable symptons ."
Deben,Very happy with clinicians,11/12/2018,5,I have often had to wait past my appointment time. I don't object because extra time is found for those who need it. I am very happy with the clinicians and I am happy with either doctors or nurse practitioners. Online booking doesn't work for me-I do other stuff online and I wish I could use it. When the practice moves I drive so it will be easier for me as I assume there will be car parking.
Deben,Very hard to get an appointment these days,8/3/2018,3,The receptionist is very intimidating when you try to get an appointment and almost seems to be trying to diagnose.
Deben,Very pleased with medical care,11/12/2018,4,My star rating would have been a 5 if I could make an appointment for a few days in the future but I can't. Only on the day or weeks in advance. I am 30 minutes late in going into my consultation today But in fairness that isn't usual. Generally I am very pleased with my medical care. When the practice moves in 2021 I will be pleased to move with them.
Deben,Very upsetting approach,4/29/2020,1,"My step Father, usually a, stoic man is having chemo for quite serious cancer. All very emotional along with appointments especially during the pandemic. He has to have a blood test the day before chemo, which informs the chemo. The gp surgery has, to do this. I overheard the very poor attitude of the care nav saying the only app was somewhere else or on 4 days before. It was horrible to listen to him keep saying but I can't make and the staff member respond so coldly and at times, with rudeness. This is unacceptable, treating someone on their late 70s who cas, a, serious illness with such rigidity and coldness. He is going across town to Riverside but it was, so upsetting for him. And in the through of very aggressive body wrenching chemo. Need to do better Deben. The ccgs pay you to take the blood...the hospitals could do a much better and more coordinated approach. Maybe care navs need training on treating people in a dignified, kind and personable way."
Deben,Wasting time & money,5/22/2017,4,"Being given different  medication that i believe is cheaper has meant repeat visits to the doctor when they do not work, wasting time and money"
Deben,Well looked after here,12/17/2018,5,I've always felt well looked after here. My visits (not that frequent!) have always gone without event. I've always thought my consultations were thorough though. I would like a bit more continuity-I seem to see different doctors each time I come in! I live between here and the proposed new site (Tooks) so it won't make much difference in terms of getting there.
Debenham,2-3 weeks waiting,9/12/2019,4,"Waiting 2-3 weeks ahead before appointment is given. They are amazing here both the doctors and the front desk staff, but they often seem pushed for time but I appreciate it is not their fault."
Debenham,A bit frustrating,10/11/2021,4,"The care has been good, it's just frustrating trying to get to the bottom of my husbands problems but this is probably the same as pre covid and I understand that the doctors have to rule things out before looking at other things."
Debenham,A bit up and down with certain staff.,10/8/2017,3,A bit up and down depending on the staff member. Would be great if I could communicate with the surgery by email but this is not allowed.
Debenham,A good practice,11/17/2016,5,"Most staff are good but on occasions it is a little less caring.  Generally it's a very good practice.  When in the practice I don't like having to tel the receptionist why I need an appointment, especially with other patients being so close.  Very helpful staff and they do their best"
Debenham,A good service,11/1/2016,5,"A very good service. I was seen quickly the only problem was that after seeing the nurse I then had to wait until the pharmacy opened 15 minutes later, not a big problem and they did call me over as soon as they opened having got the prescription ready."
Debenham,A good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"Its a good surgery, getting appointments can mean a bit of a wait for non urgent appointments which isn't a problem. It's good to have the option of going to one of the other surgery sites."
Debenham,A good surgery,4/27/2016,4,It's a good surgery.
Debenham,A great surgery,1/23/2018,5,A great surgery. I use online systems for appointments and prescriptions which works well but I do tend to call the surgery to book most appointments or if I need any additional advice or its not straight forward.
Debenham,A range of appointments available but poor communications for rest results.,10/8/2017,5,"I like the fact you can get to see the GP when needed, a nurse when less urgent and  telephone consultations, all work really well. On occasions I've been told I will be called with test results but this doesn't happen."
Debenham,A very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,A very good surgery. appointments are fairly easy to get. For routine issues there may be a bit of a wait but that's okay. They'v even offered GP+ appointmets as a alternative.
Debenham,A very good surgery with friendly staff.,9/8/2017,5,A very good surgery. I like to see my GP and it can mean a bit of a longer wait on occasions. Friendly staff in reception and the pharmacy is great. It would just be nice to see my GP quicker at times.
Debenham,Absolute shambles,4/23/2019,2,"I have been with the surgery all my life and it seems that the GPs really don’t give a toss about us younger people... please see my reasons below 


1. When going for mental health assistance I was first told to go to wellbeing Suffolk.. I did and was chucked on a waiting list with no further help, then put on sertraline and after 3 months I advised my doctor that I was not taking well to them, he only kept upping the dose age which kept making the side effects worse! 
2. Weight, since a young age of 16 I have always been told by doctors and nurses at the surgery that I am obese, with no offer of help! Now 19 I am suffering with my weight no matter what I do and they still just won’t help, all I got from my appointment today after explaining everything was “good luck” having previously been told my family would survive a famine ! I was also told I’m not big enough to have help YET
3. Having recently nearly passed out at work I was advised to see a gp so I did, he spent 3 minutes - I timed it- with me and basically said wait and see even tho I made my previous asthma aware to them. After this appointment I still was under the weather so went to out of hours to be told I have minor asthma which is aggravated by illness such as a cold! Then given an inhaler —- were they just waiting for me to have an asthma attack or pass out before helping me? 

The nurses I can’t fault as they go above and beyond but I have really lost faith in my doctors!"
Debenham,Absolutely terrible,6/9/2020,1,"Forced to travel miles to Debenham because the Grundisburgh practice is PART TIME, absolutely pathetic, made me drive to Debenham for appointment with a heart condition & when I got there Doctor told me I looked awful & needed me to get to Ipswich hospital immediately ! Due to location quicker to drive myself there than wait for an ambulance.  Now 18 months later my daughter is ill had had 4 phone consultations & seen doctor once, still can’t diagnosed what is wrong with her & constantly make me drive around to different practices for medication, dropping off samples that then get forgotten so I have to go back & collect & take to the hospital myself. Absolute joke.  one of the the receptionists is their only asset."
Debenham,Access is very good,5/13/2022,4,"Access to appointments is very good, I've not had any issues getting to see a GP when I've needed to. During the pandemic however it was a bit different and regular checks were stopped which I believe had a negative impact on a family members health.  Because checks weren't done opportunities to spot issues were missed and delayed diagnosis."
Debenham,All staff are very friendly,4/25/2016,5,I've had to come to the Debenham surgery today for an appointment as none were available at Grundisburgh. All the staff are very friendly and you don't feel they are clock watching to make sure you leave your appointment on time.
Debenham,All staff are very helpful,12/21/2021,5,"All the medical, administrative and pharmacy staff are very helpful and professional. Even when dealing with a high volume of patients and enquiries , they are always doing their best to help. They are especially good when my children are unwell and have provided phenomenal care to my wife during her prolonged illness"
Debenham,All treatment received has been great,4/27/2016,5,All treatment I've received has been great. The nurses have been changing my dressings regularly which has been good. Using the booking in computer is a little difficult and I prefer to talk to a receptionist.
Debenham,All works OK,5/11/2021,4,"Econsult works really well and probably gets you an appointment more easily than having to call the surgery. I do think it has been more difficult this year when trying to get a flu vaccination as appointments seem very limited, which I assume is down to the supply of vaccines."
Debenham,"All works well, GP's good",11/17/2016,5,Explanations from practitioners  are particularly good as they spend time with you.  Everything works well at the surgery
Debenham,Alright at the moment,11/28/2022,5,The surgery is friendly and efficient and I find that Ask My GP works well and I'm able to get a face to face appointment when needed. I try to keep with the same GP when I can but I don't visit often and everything runs smoothly and works well from my perspective.
Debenham,Always friendly and helpful,11/25/2022,5,"I use the Otley surgery and the staff there are always so helpful. I know I can't name names but the male dispensing staff member, works above and beyond every time to make sure our medicines are correct. It is nice to feel that you are being cared for in today's world and his "" be safe"" as you leave is so touching."
Debenham,Always helpful,1/15/2019,5,Small procedures can be done in house. Try hard to fit you in for urgent appointments.
Debenham,"Always well informed, would like continuity",9/4/2018,3,Got a quick appointment with the nurse this morning. Like to see the same doctor if possible. Good message on the phone which explained things well. Doctors are assuring when talking to them.
Debenham,Amazing nurse,8/10/2020,5,Whilst waiting in my car to attend an appointment at the Otley surgery I was really impressed by the nurse who was dealing with patients in such a brilliant way. She was so happy and cheerful with people and helped a young mother with a baby waiting in the wet to get out of the rain. She herself was getting wet going in and out of the surgery to patients cars but she remained cheerful throughout. I then needed to get a sample for my son tested before they were being picked up by the courier and she ensured this happened in time. It was so lovely to see someone so helpful and cheerful considering the more difficult circumstances she was obviously working in.
Debenham,Appointment access is fine,2/25/2022,5,I've used econsult to contact the surgery and this has worked well as it's quick and you're offered appointments or call backs so access to appointments has been fine and it's worked well. The doctors are lovely and you have a choice of who to see depending on the issues so that is great. From my point of view its all done well.
Debenham,Appointments,2/25/2022,5,Appointments are mostly telephone calls but I don't find they are appropriate for all issues and would prefer a face to face appointment but the clinical care is good here and the surgery overall is great.  It's just the inconvenience when you don't live locally that you have to drop samples off and then wait before talking to a GP on the phone and then coming in again when you then need to be seen.  I have used econsult and this has worked well as you get a response quickly and issues are sorted out.
Debenham,Appointments are never on time,4/27/2016,3,Appointments are never on time and because I work this is problematic. Generally the care is good but getting appointments is particularly difficult at each of the surgeries.
Debenham,Appointments easy to get,5/13/2022,4,"I don't need to visit the surgery much but when I've needed an appointment recently I've not had any problems and they are easy to get, you just need to talk to a GP first and then they invite you in."
Debenham,Appointments easy to get,1/3/2019,5,Flexible with when appointments are available and they are easy enough to get
Debenham,Appointments ok to get,2/25/2022,5,Its ok to get general appointments and all my diabetic checks have taken place and the support provided is very good if any issues do come up. From a medical perspective they do a very good job. It would be nice if outside waiting is continuing to have a covered area to wait in.
Debenham,Appointments seem random,2/5/2019,3,"Getting an appointment at the time you would like at Debenham is very much dependent, in my experience, on who is on the desk at the time you contact. I was told that I would be asked to go back for 12 month diabetic checks, but was called in much earlier and in my opinion taking up someone else's appointment. I wasn't given a clear explanation why I was called in earlier either."
Debenham,Asked for house call for visitor and got one,5/24/2016,4,"We had an elderly relative staying and we asked for a house call and they happily came out. Sometimes explanations can be a little lacking in detail. Access could be improved for the health visitors, appointments are often made later in the day which can make picking up children difficult."
Debenham,barrier to getting appointments,5/24/2016,3,Staff can be a bit of a barrier to getting appointments
Debenham,Been difficult,11/28/2022,3,Been trying to get a face to face appointment for a couple of months via Ask My GP and only today have I been given one. Reception were helpful and did the Ask My GP entry for me as I was in too much pain to do it. Depending who you talk to changes how things are dealt with and its just a lot more difficult to get seen now than it used to be.
Debenham,Blood tests can take a couple of weeks,11/22/2018,4,The blood tests at the surgery are busy and it can take 2-3 weeks at times to get an appointment. The person who takes the blood is really lovely.
Debenham,Booked appointment easily,10/8/2017,4,Booked appointment easily. Equipment for blood test wasn't available so had to re arrange another appointment with the right test tube at a different surgery a week later.
Debenham,Booking in is a problem,11/17/2016,4,the machine for booking in can be problematic.  Waiting times not as good as many years ago
Debenham,Booking machine needs fixing,9/4/2018,4,Its good in every way apart from the booking in machine never works.
Debenham,Brilliant and outstanding but need more toys in waiting area,3/20/2017,5,"Brilliant and outstanding.  Like having the flexibility of Otley and Grundisburgh.  Getting to see the practice nurse is quite difficult.  It would be good to have additional toys in the waiting room,"
Debenham,brilliant surgery,9/14/2022,5,"Very caring, brilliant surgery.  We get far more here than we did at our last surgery"
Debenham,Brilliant surgery,11/17/2016,5,A brilliant surgery.  The staff are so nice.  The flu day is a great way of bringing the community together.  We have lots of reasons to be thankful for this surgery
Debenham,Call back phone consultation seems good,9/12/2019,4,Staff work within the parameters given. They have a patient call back phone consultation before an appointment is given which is new in last 3-5 months or so.
Debenham,Call backs work well,1/3/2019,5,"Not too bad to see a specific doctor, if urgent you do get to see someone on the day and the call backs from doctors work well. Staff are helpful and accommodating when things need sorting. I have had a hiccup with a prescription being lost but they sorted it for us the next day."
Debenham,Can always get an appointment.,10/8/2017,5,"Can always get an appointment, getting through on the phone can take sometime and nothing to improve."
Debenham,Can be a long wait for an appointment,6/4/2019,4,I am happy overall with this surgery but waiting for an appointment lot can be a bit lengthy but I do realise it's not a easy job for them.
Debenham,"Can get appointment fine, staff very polite",3/30/2017,4,Having to attend the pharmacy at the other end of the village is difficult.  As is accessing the surgery from the Coopersfield end.  Very polite.  You can more or less get an appointment when needed
Debenham,Can get appointments,10/8/2017,5,I like that we can make appointments when needed and use online booking which is good. It would be good if doctors specialties/interests could be listed online.
Debenham,Can wait a while before going into GP room,9/12/2019,4,Can have to wait up to 45 mins at appointment on the odd occasion which can be frustrating. Staff and GP's are very good. Its is good that they open late.
Debenham,Care and attention has been great,9/2/2016,5,Our doctor is great he will always call us to discuss any issues we have and the care and attention has been great during very difficult times
Debenham,Care generally good,6/21/2016,4,Care has generally been good but treatment explanation has been a bit lacking and medication has been prescribed which conflicts with other medication I'm on.
Debenham,Care is good,2/13/2018,5,"Never had a problem, the care is good and you can get appointments. You do have to say why you need an appointment now which is a change."
Debenham,Care provided is good but having to travel to a different surgery is not.,10/8/2017,2,Having appointments at the surgery is ok but being asked to travel to one of the other surgeries is not. Getting to see anyone is difficult but the care provided is good.
Debenham,Care very good,5/8/2021,4,"The care given by doctors and nurses is very good but at times it does feel like you are almost jumping through hoops to get a face to face appointment, although you do get them. For my mum and dad a telephone consultation does not always work and I feel that seeing a patient in person can really add to the picture the clinician gets.  The other issue is that there is an assumption at times that people are able to access the internet. Mum for example gets her text messages to her phone but her mobile is basic and has no internet access so the links that she is sent are not accessible. To get the information in hard copy form is not always simple either, surely it should be an instant offer by the practice to provide written information if requested. On one occasion I had to contact an IT company for the information to be sent to me by email, it should've been simpler to get. My mobile is registered for appointments for me and my dad but I can't have my mums as well as messages do not say which patient they apply to and it would potentially get very confusing."
Debenham,Caring and thorough,8/8/2018,4,"You used to be able to get appointments very quickly, this is now slower but the care provided and staff are caring and thorough. Instead of syringing ears it would be good if the surgery had the suction device that the consultant used. I know I need a regular screening test but because I haven't  had a letter yet I can't book an appointment and the same applies to my childs meningitis vaccination."
Debenham,Chairs are a big improvement,11/22/2018,5,Very pleased with the surgery and the appointment system. It runs well and reduces the amount of time you need to wait around. The chairs are a big improvement and the ones with arms are good to help you get up. Staff are very good and I get all the information I require. In urgent situations appointments are available. It can take time to get through on the phone in the morning and its easier to walk to the surgery at times.
Debenham,Complaint,7/16/2018,1,My granddaughter had an appointment with Dr xxx about her weight she tries so hard and then to be told by Dr xxx that because of her genetics there is nothing he can do saying this to a young lady is not good ethics I know my family are on the large size but there is no reason to give up on her
Debenham,Completely pleased with the surgery,6/4/2018,5,"Whenever I do come to the surgery, it all works well for me, Its neat and tidy. Very satisfied with the service. Staff are friendly and attentive, I have confidence in their ability."
Debenham,Could not get an appointment for my daughter,9/14/2020,1,"Very difficult to get an appointment with a doctor. Grundisburgh surgery hardly open for prescriptions and no longer open for appointments. 
What are all our GPS doing? They certainly aren’t treating patients."
Debenham,Debenham FLU session.,10/15/2020,5,"We have nothing but praise for the way this flu immunisation exercise was conducted at Debenham, in the most difficult of circumstances. We would like to congratulate both the surgery and the DS&L staff for their commitment, professionalism and dedication on the day to the clinical task on hand. Well done to all. Thank you."
Debenham,Difficult to get nurse appointments,1/3/2019,3,"Very difficult to get appointments. Have had to wait 6 weeks to have a coil fitted and then on the morning of the appointment it was cancelled as the coil wasn't available, then I was told they no longer fitted them and I 'd have to go to the sexual health clinic in Ipswich. Again I had issues getting an appointment and it took 8 weeks to get it fitted in the end. Nurse appointments at the surgery are very difficult to get. I was told I'd missed my last appointment but I had deliberately arranged it so my daughter could have an appointment at the same time so I would never have booked it for the day before."
Debenham,Difficult to get to see doctor,3/1/2018,3,Very difficult to see a doctor but also getting blood tests and dressings. I don't drive but have had to go to the hospital for an INR blood test. they managed to squeeze me in for a blood test today which was very good. It would be good to have emergency INR appointments available. The nurses are very practical and give good support.
Debenham,Difficulties with the system,11/28/2022,3,"I've found it difficult to get to see a doctor and I keep getting errors when completing the Ask My GP form, so for me it's been a total disaster and not worked. I've had so many issues with it that don't seem to be solvable that I don't even bother with it now. I've had issues with the system not showing the responses or entries which means it is pointless to use it.  I am happy though that the reception team will complete the form for me which is great.  The other difficulty is that when I'm waiting for a call back the phone only rings a couple of times before they hang up which isn't enough for me to stop work and answer it. It then means I have to call the surgery back to say I've missed the call, listening to the long message and then wait in the queue to then wait again for them to call back.  It's just a lot more hassle than it used to be."
Debenham,difficulty getting a test done,6/22/2018,4,"I was told by my GP to arrange a 24 hour ECG with reception which I did and was told I was 12th in line to receive the equipment. A few weeks later when visiting the surgery I checked where I was and was told I wasn't on the list, I was then added again and was again 12th and told I wouldn't receive the equipment until May. I've had all the other tests and I'm just waiting to have this one now. If there is such a wait for the equipment may be another one could be purchased."
Debenham,Dispensary staff really good,5/8/2021,5,"Whenever we've needed to get medication quickly the dispensary staff have been really great. In the past I've needed to get medication for my parents for their conditions and they do all they can to get it in by the end of the day for you. More recently we ran out of an antibiotic for my son, thinking we already had some there but they managed to arrange for a bottle to be ordered in for later in the day, brilliant."
Debenham,Do their best,8/8/2018,4,"They do what they do and well, they are so friendly. It is difficult to get appointments, I can understand this but seeing the nurse can be just as difficult. They do their best and theres not much they could do better."
Debenham,Doctor has been great,4/25/2016,5,The doctor I've seen is absolutely great. The way I've been treated is wonderful. I've moved recently but have been very impressed by the support I've been given.
Debenham,Doctor was very reassuring,4/1/2019,5,"I saw a very nice young doctor recently. She was so caring, friendly and approachable, really took an interest and was very reassuring.  I managed to get an appointment fairly quickly and was happy with everything."
Debenham,Doctors are friendly.,10/8/2017,4,"Doctors are very friendly. The building is small, especially the waiting area. Waiting to see a specific doctor can be a little long."
Debenham,Doctors explain well,1/3/2019,5,"Friendly and approachable staff, you can mostly get appointments when you need them. Doctors explain things well and don't make you feel silly for asking questions, generally works well for me."
Debenham,"Doctors really listen, have time for you and",4/27/2016,5,"Doctors really listen, have time for you, have genuine concern and offer good advice. Over the years there have been occasions where I have had to wait at least 1/2 hour for my appointment. The automated phone booking system is not flexible enough and it would help to be able to book by date.  I've had no problems getting appointments on the day and have used the later appointment times on a thursday"
Debenham,Don't answer phone when website states they're open,5/19/2017,2,They do not pick up phone even when it's supposed to be open- poor service when so few local branches
Debenham,Dr (name removed) - Compliment,11/30/2021,3,"I should like to convey my compliments, applause, gratitude and regards in respect of Dr (name removed). He couldn't do more for me and his attention to my condition was exemplary and sincere. Dr (name removed) instilled such confidence and a duty of care which I found quite remarkable and personable. Please stay at the Debenham Surgery, as you are very much appreciated, regarded and respected. (submitted by son, on behalf of patient)"
Debenham,Drive-by flu jab session a success.,9/10/2020,5,"I wrote the following letter on returning from the “drive-by” flu session yesterday.
Dear Manager
Please pass on a big thank-you to everyone associated with today’s mammoth undertaking in dispensing flu jabs. It was so very well-organised from start to finish - text reminders, parking marshals, helpful staff on hand for advice and excellent “jabbers”.
Not the best weather for you all but behind the masks we could tell there were plenty of smiles.
Well done again.
Kind regards,
A Patient"
Debenham,DRIVE-IN FLU JAB SESSION,10/13/2020,5,This was a major logistic task for the Surgery and I believe they coped extremely well under difficult circumstances.  Access to the site was quite busy but there were a lot of staff around to help.  If this is to be a regular occurrence perhaps there could be arranged a one way system in operation in Gracechurch Street.  Overall - Well Done !!
Debenham,E consult works well,5/8/2021,5,I've used the e consult system on the website a few times and find it really useful for non urgent matters. The doctors have always called back by the time advised on the email confirmation and the issues have always been quick to sort out. Being a generic system some of the boxes or questions are not always relevant but its worked well for our family. It saves having to make a call during work hours as it can be done at any point. A great way to contact the practice.
Debenham,Easier to get appointments,2/13/2018,4,Referrals are made and things get sorted out. Have had an issue when I was told I could only discuss certain issues in an appointment with a doctor but appointments are now easier to get.
Debenham,Easy access,11/17/2016,5,It's easy to get to.  Due to my needs it is better to see the same GP to maintain continuity.  Seeing the same GP can mean sightly long waits
Debenham,Easy access to appointments,11/17/2016,5,I like the fact you can get an appointment when needed and they are all very friendly and helpful.  I'm not worried about who I see
Debenham,Easy to use system,11/28/2022,5,I called the surgery this morning and was told about the Ask My GP system. I found that it was pretty easy to register with and then to use and I've been given an appointment after talking to the doctor on the phone. I'm happy with the quick turnaround and the appointment.  I was a bit worried when I was asked to go online but it's all worked well.
Debenham,Econsult works well,10/11/2021,4,Although econsult is a little difficult to use as at times it is a little unclear where information needs to go it is an easier way to contact the surgery and more convenient. I received a call back quickly but it would've been helpful to know when to expect the call as at different times of the day I need to be contacted on my mobile and not the landline. Speaking to the doctor then led to an appointment with them which is great.
Debenham,Effective organisation with helpful staff,9/24/2018,4,"Getting an appointment is straightforward and much can be done online which I find convenient eg: repeat prescriptions, appointments, test results.

Most important the GP's I have encountered have listened carefully to what I have had to say and been thoughtful and careful in their diagnosis, sometimes taking time for further research."
Debenham,Efficient and helpful,6/11/2018,5,Impressed by way doctors will phone up to discuss a condition or give medication advice.
Debenham,Everyone at surgery very friendly and helpful,9/24/2019,5,I sometimes struggle with my speech everyone has been extremely kind and helpful
Debenham,Everyone cares,11/17/2016,5,I've never had a problem.  I like it because everyone cares and they are really helpful.  Even if you need longer than 15 minutes you are always given the time you need and never feel rushed
Debenham,Everyone is very pleasant,4/27/2016,5,"The nice relaxed staff make the surgery. Everyone is very pleasant and approachable. To see any doctor is not a problem but to see a specific doctor can take a couple of weeks. I wouldn't complain about anything, they do a great job. Having to wait to see a doctor is not an issue either."
Debenham,Everything about the practice is excellent,11/25/2019,5,"I can normally get appointments when needed (through the system or sometimes over the phone), all of the people that work at the practice are always very helpful and I feel very confident in the medical team."
Debenham,Excellent,3/10/2017,5,Never had a problem with the surgery. The doctors are pushed for time but they have time for you as a patient and focus on you and not the computer screen. For a family member they were very supportive. From my experience it all runs smoothly
Debenham,Excellent,3/10/2017,5,"Works very well, adapted to getting busier.  The doctors are very good and friendly.  Impressed with how I've been looked after"

Debenham,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Waiting times are generally very good.  Excellent care.  The doctors have even phoned to check how things were going and then followed up and referred to hospital
Debenham,Excellent & caring but facilities are old,3/30/2017,5,"A good, caring surgery;  the building isn't easy to get around but it's an old building not a purpose built one"
Debenham,Excellent all round,3/30/2017,5,A very good surgery.  They organise good support and care.  I've had many different professionals visit me and I feel well supported.  Surgery is one of the best.  MY GP is lovely
Debenham,Excellent and friendly,4/5/2017,5,Very friendly and accommodating.  GP's and nurses are very good.  Don't feel that you're being a nuisance or rushed through.  A friendly family atmosphere where you have time to explain concerns to he doctor

Debenham,"Excellent GP's, appointments sometimes hard to get",3/30/2017,5,"Doctors are great here but referrals through to the hospital took a long time.  Most of the time it works very well, although appointments can be a little tricky to get at times"
Debenham,Excellent Service,6/8/2021,5,My husband and I are new patients at Otley and attended an appointment with the clinician.  She was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble.
Debenham,Excellent service,11/24/2020,5,"Easy to get appointments. All staff are very professional and friendly.
If you have a problem it is dealt with very efficiently."
Debenham,Excellent service,12/14/2016,5,"New staff have started so am just getting to know new receptionist - not problematic.  In remission after suffering from cancer so happy to be a patient in Debenham.  Excellent service, no complaints"
Debenham,Excellent service,11/17/2016,5,"Very lucky, couldn't be better.  I try to see my own doctor to maintain continuity, otherwise you do have to explain everything.  I really do like the flu day at the community centre"
Debenham,Excellent staff,11/17/2016,5,Brilliant staff.  Staff wil always apologise if there has been an emergency and a delay.  The staff will always cal if they want to see you for any reason
Debenham,Excellent staff and doctors,11/17/2016,5,Really excellent staff - very friendly.  The doctors are good.  They do their best and I've never had any problems.  I've always been referred on when needed.  Diabetic nurse has bee really useful
Debenham,Excellent surgery,11/17/2016,5,If it's not urgent I get to see my own GP but if urgent I'll see anyone.  My GP hasn't received a letter from the hospital so I can't start my Warfarin yet.  I've had to order more medication and if I start the warfarin this will then be wasted
Debenham,Excellent surgery & staff,11/17/2016,5,There is very little information about joining the PPG in the surgery and I was unaware they were active.  It's a lovely friendly surgery and staff are great.  You can always get appointments when needed.
Debenham,Excellent traditional practice,3/30/2017,5,I like the 3 practices as it gives you flexibility.  It's also a more traditional family practice
Debenham,Excellent. Easy to get appointments,4/5/2017,5,It's great that you can get appointments when needed and that the GP will always call you to discuss issues rather than requiring you to visit the surgery
Debenham,Excellent. Helpful staff,3/30/2017,5,I'm very happy with the surgery.  The only problem is the long walk to the surgery.  Receptionists are very helpful when trying to book an appointment
Debenham,Fair but lack of staff caused appointments to be cancelled,4/5/2017,3,No diabetic nurse at the surgery and 2 appointments have been cancelled.  There's been a delay in having a further check after an annual review highlighting something was wrong.
Debenham,Fair but over capacity,11/17/2016,3,Having the additional surgeries linked to the practice has impacted on the care provided.  I feel that I can't just pick up the phone and ring if I'm concerned about things.  I've been made to feel that I'm visiting for no reason
Debenham,Fair but some staff issues,11/17/2016,3,At times some staff are not particularly helpful.  I've got used to waiting to see my doctor but if you want to see a good doctor you will have to wait.  The doctors and nurses are all very good.  To be specific it took  2 weeks to be able to see my doctor.  it's a very busy surgery.  I get my prescriptions from the chemist which works well
Debenham,Fair but very hard to see specific doctor,3/20/2017,3,"Seeing a specific doctor is more difficult.  We''ve had to wai t4   weeks to see a specific doctor today, but we like to see the same doctor if possible"
Debenham,Feels less accessible,11/25/2022,4,It's not as easy as it used to be and feels less accessible and that you have to push to get a face to face appointment but the staff are really lovely and have been so great today. The nurse I saw had a lovely disposition and looked in to an issue that I hadn't even come in for which was great.  Once you are in it's been wonderful it just the feeling that the system is less accessible and you have to go online to get seen.
Debenham,Flu jab,10/31/2020,1,"This is obviously a communication issue and in no way a critique about the level of care that this practice provides. They are usually very good.  However, I arrived as instructed by text at Otley College for flu jab - 9-10 am session - 31st October.  There was no-one around.   I talked to three other drivers who had also turned up and were driving around the site.  Went to surgery, it was closed, but thought it worth checking. No answer on phone. Checked website when I got home and seems that today was cancelled and that patients would be notified of alternative dates.  Sadly, this did not happen with myself, nor does it seem with a few others."
Debenham,Flu jab,10/20/2020,5,I went on my mobility scooter and was sent straight to the front of the queue.
Debenham,Flu jab at Debenham Leisure Centre,11/14/2020,5,"I just wanted to say thank you to all the team who were in any way involved in the flu jab delivery in October  at the Leisure Centre. It must have been a massive undertaking for you and given the large numbers of people who turned up, very exhausting for you all - not to mention the appalling weather you had to contend with. I thought it was managed with great efficiency and friendliness and it was great to be able to get it completed from within my own car in such a safe way. Thank you"
Debenham,Friendly and helpful staff,4/27/2016,5,Friendly and helpful staff
Debenham,Friendly and polite staff,11/16/2018,5,"On the whole very good, very quick to get appointments and staff are polite and friendly. The appointment system and the various ways you can get help are good. A 24 hr ECG took 3 weeks to get organised and once I had it the results were then lost which was frustrating. I decided to go private now as I can. Generally though the surgery and all staff are very good."
Debenham,Friendly atmosphere,11/22/2018,5,They are quick to act when something needs to be done and staff create a friendly atmosphere. You can wait a bit to see someone specific but if I can't see them its not an issue. The reception staff are absolutely brilliant but they could do with more staff to help.
Debenham,Friendly service,5/24/2016,5,Having a local service that is friendly is great. Getting to see a doctor is not a problem and I don't mind not seeing the same doctor all the time.
Debenham,Friendly staff,6/4/2019,5,"Friendly staff, excellent service at this surgery.
Parking area is a bit small."
Debenham,Friendly staff,11/22/2018,4,If you want to see a specific doctor its usually within acceptable time-frames but ideally it would be a bit quicker. Staff are friendly. A timed call back would help as it can take some time to hear back. You may have to wait to be seen but you're not rushed in your own appointment.
Debenham,Friendly staff,7/8/2018,3,"Staff are friendly when you are dealing with them. Theres little flexibility with appointments so have needed multiple appointments over different visits which has been very difficult, mobility wise."
Debenham,Friendly staff,4/5/2018,5,"Friendly staff, normally get an appointment when you need one and they are normally very good with the children. There can be quite long delays in the surgery waiting for your appointment. Its frustrating that if you phone in the afternoon you can't book an appointment for the next day, you have to call back in the morning."
Debenham,Friendly staff,9/8/2017,5,"Staff are always friendly, I can get what I want when I need it so no complaints."
Debenham,Friendly surgery,6/22/2018,4,"Local friendly surgery, try to be helpful, I'm happy to travel to other surgery locations if needed. At times you have to wait a couple of weeks to see a specific doctor but if you really need an appointment you will be seen. We see different doctors depending on their speciality and staff are very helpful trying to sort things out for us."
Debenham,Friendly surgery,11/17/2016,5,A very friendly surgery.  I like my GP.  It would be better if we could collect our prescriptions from the surgery not the chemist. The Denham pharmacy is very good.  They will call to discuss any issues
Debenham,Friendly surgery,4/25/2016,5,Having a local service that is friendly is great. Getting to see a doctor is not a problem and I don't mind not seeing the same doctor all the time.

Debenham,"Friendly, helpful staff.",3/30/2017,5,"All friendly and helpful.  Can normally see a doctor, not necessarily your own doctor, when needed.  Getting to see a specific doctor would be better."

Debenham,Good,11/25/2022,5,"I'm happy with how Ask My GP is working, I had some anxiety when it was first introduced but it is working well to get appointments or issues sorted.  Staff are good and the surgery is doing really well. Last week there was a ten day wait for a blood test but this week I got one the next day which was great."
Debenham,Good,2/1/2021,4,I would like more info about the Covid vaccine on the website even if it says we have no news about it. Everyone must be wondering when they will get their jab but there is no mention of it on the web site.

Debenham,Great doctor,11/25/2022,4,"We submitted an Ask My GP for our young son and we're pleased with how great he was with him, very reassuring and kind and had him easily doing everything that was needed. He covered all basis and made sure we knew what to do if anything got worse.  The only issue we had with the system was that we had to contact reception to ask for a different telephone number to be used for the call back as I was working and his father needed to speak to the doctor.  unfortunatley this didn't happen initially but after speaking to reception again it was all sorted."
Debenham,Great nurses,5/8/2021,5,"I injured my finger and visited the nurses for them to assess and then dress the wound, which they have been great at. The reception staff at Grundisburgh, my normal surgery are brilliant so helpful and friendly, they are great at what they do and how they are with you. I've come to Debenham today and wasn't really sure what I was meant to do on arrival as each site seems to vary a bit but treatment and care as normal has been great.

Debenham,Great staff from all departments,12/29/2020,5,"I am a very frequent user of the group practice, usually at Otley, but also either of the other surgeries if necessary. Having 3 increases the likelihood of seeing someone. Also being disabled it can be hard sometimes for me to go, but whoever it is I wish to consult is more than happy to phone me. I find the medical staff to be good listeners and treat my opinion as very relevant, unlike in some places I've been."
Debenham,Great support from GPs,7/16/2015,5,I'm happy to see the nurse practitioner.  The one to one support from the GPs when my husband was unwell was very good and went beyond what I would expect.
Debenham,Great to get reminders,7/1/2019,5,I think it's great that the surgery are reminding eligible patients by text that they can book flu vaccinations. When things are busy its easy to forget. Generally get good support from the surgery and staff are always friendly.
Debenham,Happy to see any GP,1/8/2022,5,"I've had no problems getting appointments for a blood test or for a general appointment with a GP. I'm happy to see any of the GPs and have had no issues calling the surgery for appointments, it all works well."
Debenham,Happy with how it works,10/8/2021,5,"I'm happy to go with the flow with the changes that have been put in place during the pandemic, the triage system works well for me and I don't have to come to the surgery all the time as things can usually be sorted out over the phone."
Debenham,Happy with the surgery,6/4/2018,4,Can generally see someone when you need an appointment. Staff are friendly and helpful but at time a bit more information would be better. I like that you can do your own blood pressure checks in the waiting area. The sign in computer isn't working still.
Debenham,Has got harder to get appointments,4/25/2016,4,Over the last couple of months I've noticed it has got harder to get appointments.
Debenham,Has worked well,5/8/2021,4,Just returned to the surgery so not really sure how things are working at the moment but when I called the other day about my medication I was given a telephone consultation which worked well and I've now got my medication sorted.
Debenham,Have to wait for an appointment with my Dr.,8/4/2016,4,"I've just tried to get an appointment to see my doctor but have been told it will be in three weeks time. I can however, see another doctor sooner."
Debenham,Help not availble and no advice given,7/1/2019,3,I inquired about having a wart removed from my hand after treating at home unsuccessfully and was told it would be arranged. A few weeks later I received a letter saying that treatment was no longer available from the surgery but I wasn't then told what to do next or how to treat.
Debenham,Helpful & kind but need simple explanations,11/17/2016,5,"The doctors have been very helpful and kind.  It would help if explanations were simplified and avoided medical technology.  The practice meets our needs and referrals have all been made promptly..
Being able to see the same doctor is great when they are available.  There are times when this is not possible and we're happy to see any of the GPs."
Debenham,Helpful staff,1/23/2018,5,A great surgery where you can get appointments when needed. I called to be told there were no appointments available but that they would call me when the GP+ appointments were released.  Within 20 minutes I had another call saying an appointment to see the nurse was available. Very helpful staff
Debenham,Helpful staff,4/27/2016,4,Staff are very quick to assist in what ever way they can
Debenham,Here when really needed,4/11/2020,5,"I'm 12 days into Covid and feeling increasingly poorly. I called111 and was called back by a doctor who advised I should be seen and assessed the same day via my usual practice. I called to arrange this and was called back within the hour and an appointment arranged within a further 2 hours. I was met in the car park by the wonderful doctor, who could not have been more attentive and kind. He checked my BP, pulse, and Oxygen levels and listened to my chest and thoroughly reassured me. Truly excellent service in my time of need."
Debenham,Highly rated,9/12/2019,5,I prefer to make my appointments face to face. I do rate this surgery very highly.
Debenham,I feel insecure and uncared for,7/19/2018,1,"At 6 months review they diagnosed HBP so tablet strength was increased considerably. This produced a 'Zombie' like reaction. I was told to stop (taking the tablets) over the 'phone but this didn't help so I went to the emergency doctor at Occold. They were shocked at the strength and said that the tablets should never have been prescribed. So all the tablets were taken away and I was told to get another appointment with my own doctor. However, that has proved impossible so I have self prescribed myself the original dose. I have had to ring 111 twice now as the lethargy has continued. I feel insecure and uncared for."
Debenham,I like the morning call back from GP,9/12/2019,4,They do need to take into consideration patients who work who are trying to seek appointments at times that are at more convenient times. I do like the morning call back from the doctor when they dont have appointments available.
Debenham,Inaccessible Dispensary,5/22/2017,4,"Access to the dispensary is very difficult due to the steps and more often than not the lift doesn't work, making it impossible for someone with mobility problems"
Debenham,Incredibly well run,5/11/2021,5,"Its an incredibly well run surgery, so organised and staff are really friendly. Prescriptions have all been fine and are ready on time, have had one small issue with medication being missed out of the bag but this was sorted quickly. When we've needed appointments for the children they've been seen face to face and we've also been able to arrange home visits for elderly neighbours. The support provided by the GP for caring for my neighbour has been excellent and really appreciated."
Debenham,It works well,1/8/2022,5,I booked a couple of days ago to see a nurse for my annual review and it works very well. I do really struggle to get to the surgery as I have no family locally and there are no buses anymore.
Debenham,Joining the practice,2/25/2022,5,I've just picked up registration forms to join the surgery and the staff member I spoke to was lovely.  So helpful and explained how it all works and how long it is likely to take.
Debenham,"Kind, courteous, professional service.",2/14/2021,5,Managed my health care demands both surgical and medical without fuss. Kept clear and informative dialogue at all times with follow up when needed.
Debenham,Lack of appointments.,9/2/2017,4,A few of my stitches popped open so I called the surgery to see if they could take a look.  I was told there were no appointments available which was disappointing
Debenham,Lack of information,8/8/2018,4,I was told by the nurse that I had something quite seriously wrong and that I would need to see the GP and have a blood test. Appointments to see the GP were not available for 10 days and the blood test would be 20 days which meant that I've had not information about what I should be doing or how serious it is.
Debenham,"Lack of information, nurses good",11/17/2016,4,"If you don't go to the surgery very often you don't find out when the flu sessions are and then you don't get it done.  I hadn't seem anything around the village to let us know.
Like the nurse practitioners"
Debenham,Lack of information.,12/22/2020,4,"My wife and I are in our 80s and both suffer from sundry illnesses. Family and friends in other parts of Suffolk have already had their first Covid vaccinations. Would it not be possible for the practice management to put a message on the website saying what the present position is regarding at least the distant promise of action on this front.  I appreciate that all practices are under severe pressure at present, but surely this would not take long and might give us something to look forward to after Christmas."
Debenham,Level of care is superb,11/17/2016,5,"Everybody is so kind and my level of care is superb.  The information leaflets in the surgery are really good.  
Photographs of staff should be done professionally so that they portray individuals as they really are"
Debenham,Like having the choice of doctors,1/3/2019,4,"I like having the choice of doctors to see, its a friendly local surgery. Can't normally get an appointment when its needed, this appointment has taken since early December to get seen.  They are very busy, this time it hasn't caused a problem but in the past it has resulted in a hospital visit."
Debenham,Like that we're not quizzed as to why we need an appointment. Reception staff polite.,10/8/2017,5,Phoned up yesterday for an appointment today and got one. I was not quizzed about why the appointment was needed which was great. Reception staff were polite and helpful .
Debenham,Like to see the same doctor,1/3/2019,5,"Very pleased with the surgery, you can generally get appointments when needed. I do like to see the same doctor for ongoing issues. Online services aren't great, would be better to be able to book blood tests or injections online but you can't. I have to come to the surgery regularly and not being able to combine appointments is difficult. Its also not easy to get regular medications and its frustrating to have to visit the surgery so often.  I don't see why you have to come in for medication reviews when a conversion on the phone would be as good, especially when I end up telling the nurse about my condition and managing the related medications."
Debenham,Liked the registration checks completed,4/5/2018,5,"When we first registered additional checks were done for my son which I really liked. I like having the other surgery to go to as it gives you flexibility around appointments, which are easy enough to get."
Debenham,Long phone message,11/28/2022,3,The introductory phone message is really long and seems unnecessary. I got cut off mid way through talking to reception and then had to join the queue again. The new system is a big change to the way we used to get appointments and I really don't like the rigmarole that you now have to go through to get an appointment. Generally this surgery and the staff have always been great but I really don't like this change.
Debenham,Lovely helpful staff,6/6/2018,5,"I can't fault our surgery, always get an appointment, fantastic doctors."
Debenham,Manage to see the same person,10/8/2017,4,"I like seeing the same person for certain issues and manage to do this when wanted. Its a well run surgery, the change to the reception area is much better as I prefer to book appointments at the surgery."
Debenham,Marvellous,10/11/2021,5,The reception staff are really great and I get to see my GP regularly and all referrals have been done quickly. I've been given good explanations and considering what the situation is they are all doing amazingly well.
Debenham,May have to wait for a specific doctor,6/22/2018,5,The surgery does what you need. You can get appointments when you need them but you may have to wait a while to see a specific doctor or travel to one of the other surgeries.
Debenham,Mixed experiences,8/8/2018,4,"Getting your doctor of choice is very difficult, it can be weeks to see someone. Its better to see a GP who knows you as they understand your condition and how best to treat. I had an experience with a locum who went in to so much detail that I had many unnecessay tests where as my doctor wouldn't have everything so quickly as they know my history. If you want to talk things through and get information when you're worried its difficult. On another family member the care has been very good, so our experiences have been mixed."
Debenham,More appointments to be available please,9/12/2019,3,They do offer a phone consultation if they cannot fit you in on the day. If I could change anything I would have more available appointments.
Debenham,More appointments would be good,6/4/2019,4,Appointment making - the availability of more appointment slots would be better for me. But overall I am very content with the service here
Debenham,More consideration on appointment times,6/4/2019,1,"I avoid the surgery as much as I can, I find it disappointing to only be offered one appointment slot which is often at a time that is inconvenient for me. I have 3 children and I work so more consideration would be appreciated. Sadly I find some of the reception staff to be blunt and rude, although today's staff are fine."
Debenham,More than adequate,9/12/2019,4,This is more than adequate as a surgery.
Debenham,More than happy,3/8/2022,5,The surgery asked me to come in for a blood test and when I called up I got an appointment quickly with an HCA. I do try to see the same GP if possible to maintain continuity and I believe that my notes identify that I should see the one GP if possible due to my conditions. Obviously if it was an emergency I'd be happy to see any doctor. I'd like to be able to book appointments online but this isn't currently available but it would be useful.
Debenham,Never any appointments or cannot book for next am!,5/22/2017,1,"Never any appointments at Debenham, Otley or grundisburgh- cannot book appointment for following morning so have to take pot luck- also opening hours at not 07.30-6.30 as advertised on website but seem to be from 08.30 when I managed to get through after trying for 1 hour"
Debenham,New to the practice but very pleased,5/8/2021,5,"I transferred to the practice fairly recently after experiencing difficulties at my previous practice. Registering was really quick and simple and the receptionists whenever you speak to them are really lovely, so friendly and cheerful. As soon as we were registered they arranged for my young daughter to have her immunisations quickly as they had not been done by the normal dates at the last practice. Really impressed with everything."
Debenham,"No always empathic, but happy overall.",6/4/2019,4,"Quite happy with the surgery overall, it would be nice if the GP showed a bit more empathy at times. I was a bit disappointed that I had a stent fitted earlier in the year and neither the GP nor the hospital requested a follow up"
Debenham,No complaint whatsoever,6/4/2018,5,"Always able to get an appointment with a doctor when needed. Never have any problems, good staff too."
Debenham,"No Issues, Good surgery",9/12/2019,5,"No issues, good surgery. It is easy to make appointments, the GP call back works well for me, I have had two call backs this week already."
Debenham,No problems getting through,1/3/2019,5,It was straight forward to register as a new patient and getting an appointment so far has worked well. I've had no problems getting through on the phone in the morning its all worked well for me.
Debenham,Non urgent appointments work well,11/22/2018,5,I don't visit often but for non urgent appointments it works well. I tend to phone for appointments and get seen when I need to.
Debenham,Normally get an appointment on the day,11/22/2018,5,"A very good surgery, doctors follow up and call you back. If you need an appointment the same day and call first thing you normally get one the same day even if it means travelling to one of the other surgery sites."
Debenham,"Not a private as it could be, small car park",6/4/2019,4,"The current recorded message on the phone system is way too long and slow, it must be about 4 minutes in length. Can it be re-recorded or be given an option to skip it?
The size of the surgery encroaches on personal privacy, also the car park is too small for the number of patients."
Debenham,Not always as private as I'd like it to be,6/4/2019,5,I really do think that the reception area is not conducive for any privacy also the reception staff seem oblivious to this and seem to talk quite loud and it can be about private details. Also I observe that the check in screen is too open as people can see from the waiting area names and dates of birth.
Debenham,Not always great explanations,4/5/2018,4,"It's an Ok surgery but things are not always explained as well as they should be, I've not been kept informed of what is happening. I have to attend 6 monthly diabetic checks but all my tests are normal."
Debenham,Not informed of problem initially,1/3/2019,2,"I received a letter out of the blue informing me that I had a condition that I wasn't aware of. I spoke to staff to explain it must be a mistake as I do not have the condition and I heard nothing more. Then months later I received another letter saying the same and that I needed to be checked. Again I called and was told I did have the condition and that I needed to come in. The only blood test I had had was years before so I should have been told then surely. I've now had follow up tests, which have been delayed and I'm visiting the surgery now to find out what is happening and the condition I apparently have.  Generally to get appointments  its not too bad."
Debenham,Not overly helpful,11/25/2022,3,I called when I was in pain but was told no appointment was available and that a call back might not happen that day. I'm not online but keep being pushed to use it to get appointments and reception wasn't overly helpful.  I found them more to be a barrier to getting seen.  I had been in hospital and was told to call the surgery if I had any problems but when I did I couldn't be seen. In the end I called 111 who said to go to A&E. I really don't like the system that is in place now it makes it more difficult.
Debenham,Nurse very reassuring,6/20/2017,5,Saw the nurse was very reassuring and explained everything well.. Just have to wait 8 weeks for results to come in.
Debenham,Nurses are good and getting appointments is easy.,10/8/2017,5,"You can come in and get an appointment fairly easily, quite satisfied with the service. All the nurses are very good."
Debenham,Online access works well,1/8/2022,5,I've found that using the online system for appointments works very well for me and allows quick appointments with one of the clinicians.
Debenham,Overall very pleased,7/16/2015,5,Overall very pleased with the service compared with what I've come from its great.
Debenham,Phone consultation not always best,5/8/2021,2,"I'm very disappointed that my 6 week post birth check of both me and my baby has been offered as a phone consultation. I don't feel this is appropriate at all, I can not understand how it is best for a mother to be asked questions over the phone rather than the baby and her being seen by the doctor, especially considering I had a c section. I've also not had a good experience using econsult. After completing the online form and being told I would be contacted by a doctor I wasn't and never was."
Debenham,Phone message is very long,11/16/2018,4,"I like the online prescription ordering which makes it quicker and easier. It would be nice to be able to book nurse appointments online too. I like the appointment system, it means that you will always get one with in a reasonable time frame and there are various options available. The phone message is very long and the main point of the message gets lost, it needs to be more concise. Appointments can run behind but you're given time in your appointment which is good."
Debenham,Pleasant staff. Getting appointments in advance is hard.,10/8/2017,5,"Staff very pleasant, can go to the different surgery locations and can get on the day appointments. Getting a routine appointment took four weeks to see anyone, it would be nice to be able to book appointments for non urgent issues more quickly. For the children they have been great and always willing to see them."
Debenham,"Poor. Hard to get appointments, staff lovely.",3/20/2017,2,"When I tried to get an appointment this week was told nothing was available Thursday or Friday.  A nurse called and I was seen late Friday.  I was told to come back next week but no appointments were available until Wednesday.
Staff are lovely when you get to see them but availability is more difficult"
Debenham,Positive experiences.,6/8/2016,5,During April I recognised that I was experiencing a low and was showing signs of a hypomania so I phoned my surgery and was given an appointment that day. Although the doctor wasn't my usual point of contact she was very considerate. I felt she was listening and understood how I should be  treated - she also made concern finding support - Bipolar UK> This only continues the positive experience I have had with the practice.
Debenham,Practice nurses excellent.,12/11/2021,3,"Face to face seems impossible. Never  a doctor to have an appointment if needed for appointment that day, only other staff. Phoned told to ring 111, 4 hrs later ( told would be 2 hrs) GP called and told to go to A and E for X-ray. Just drop in. It seems incorrect. Was there 8+ hours."
Debenham,Prefer to see doctors rather than locums,7/16/2015,3,I'd like to be able to see the doctors rather than locums that visit.
Debenham,Quick service,5/24/2016,5,"I visited with my grandson, was seen within 5 minutes and got everything we needed."
Debenham,Quickly referred,5/11/2015,5,Visited my doctor as my knee has progressively got worse. She referred me to have physio and gave me contact details to arrange an x-ray. With in days of seeing her I had an appointment for an x ray and have an appointment with the physio team.
Debenham,Quite easy to get appointments,1/3/2019,4,"Its quite easy to get an appointment, if you want to see someone specific it does take longer and can be a couple of weeks. If urgent you do get an appointment quickly especially for the children. It is difficult to get to see a nurse after school hours so we've had to have an asthma check in school time which is a shame"
Debenham,Quite long waits to see a doctor,3/1/2018,4,Feel there are quite long waits to see a doctor but you do get to see a nurse which on my last visit worked very well.
Debenham,Really good care,2/25/2022,5,I've not needed to use the surgery much but when I have the care has been really good. Having the phone consultations means you don't have to come to the surgery for everything which is great. Staff are good at what they do providing a caring service. I wonder whether it would be possible to offer video consultations so that you still don't have to go to the surgery but the doctor is able to see you.
Debenham,Reception lovely,5/8/2015,4,"Go on the waiting list if you want an appointment the same week, You wait for a call back with a cancellation or  a phone call from the Dr. They do what they can."
Debenham,regularly get things wrong with prescriptions,8/20/2020,2,"They often cant find my prescription and most of the time something is missing.  nor can they handle changes,  request and repeats

Also on another occasion sent blood test by email and they ignored

Booking cant book more than 1 x month ahead so repeat needs sy 3 x monthly cant be booked ahead"
Debenham,Relaxed about who I see,1/8/2022,3,"I'm fairly relaxed about who I see but when you request a specific person through Ask My GP you don't always get them and may be given a nurse. I live in Otley but often get asked to travel to Debenham for appointments which is frustrating.  I don't feel that the information provided about how Ask My GP will use my data is explained well at all and it says that the information is semi anonymous, surely it is either anonymous or its not."
Debenham,resetting password,5/26/2021,5,Fantastic. so helpful and quick.
Debenham,Seeing a specific gp takes time.,12/12/2017,3,When you ring up to see a specific GP it can take a couple of weeks to see them.
Debenham,Small and friendly,4/5/2018,5,"Its a community surgery, small and friendly."
Debenham,Staff are good,3/1/2018,4,"The staff are good, they're nice and pleasant. Quite flexible with appointments and not too perturbed by the new questions receptionists asked, I can understand why they are asking. Prescriptions are filled accurately and I got my appointment for my blood test."
Debenham,Staff are lovely,4/5/2018,5,Brilliant. Can get an appointment when you need one. The staff are lovely and always try to help. You can always go to the other surgery site too. Its a good practice.
Debenham,Staff are polite and helpful,3/1/2018,5,Staff are polite and helpful. It's difficult to get appointments with a doctor with the change in the system. If you have a mental health issue sometimes this is all the doctor sees rather than treating the person as a whole and looking for other issues.
Debenham,Staff are very good,1/23/2018,5,"The change in the system where by you can only see a nurse on the day and not a doctor can be difficult. You don't have a choice and I would prefer at time to have the choice rather than just seeing the nurse. With ongoing issues you can waste time of the nurse if you know that you will need to see the GP anyway.  Staff have been very good, very caring and supportive and great in an urgent situation."
Debenham,Staff attitudes are very good,4/5/2018,4,"Can get appointments when you need with a GP but you can see your own GP if you prefer. Staff attitudes are very good. I do like that its a small community surgery. The decoration could be improved, if you were a new patient it would be a bit confusing where reception is."
Debenham,Staff have been excellent,4/27/2016,5,We've just moved but so far all staff have been excellent and I've been very impressed. Very approachable and prompt dealing with us. We brought the new patient forms in a couple of weeks before we moved and by the time we moved in everything was sorted. It would've been great to get a welcome pack with contact details so we know who to call.
Debenham,Staff helpful,1/8/2022,5,After injuring my hand I have been able to book appointments to have the dressings re-done and there's no problem getting appointments for blood tests. It can be a little wait for them but nothing too bad. The staff are very helpful and supportive.
Debenham,Staff very helpful,7/8/2018,5,"They've been brilliant. Been fitted in this morning and I'm happy with how the system works. When waiting for a call back it can be difficult as you don't know when they will be calling you back and you may have to take children to school, being given a timeframe would help. Staff are very helpful, I've never had a problem,"
Debenham,Still can see a Dr. at short notice,1/12/2020,5,Even in this terrible time of Covid the doctor still has time for us.
Debenham,Supportive reception staff,11/25/2022,4,"When I called today, I was told that the new system to get an appointment was online, so they explained how to register with Ask My GP, and what I had to do, and it all worked well. Within 20 minutes of submitting the form I had a call back from a doctor and was then invited in for an appointment with a doctor.  It has worked so well this morning I don't really feel anything needs to change. The staff have all been great and have explained everything so well."
Debenham,Supports you well,4/5/2018,4,Its quite easy to get appointments. Generally a good surgery that supports you well when you need them.
Debenham,Surgery is good,6/4/2019,4,I would like to be able to get my medication from the surgery instead of the local pharmacy as they sometimes don't have everything that is prescribed to me in stock. This can be an inconvenience to me. The surgery is very good though.
Debenham,Surgery works to high standards,4/27/2016,5,On occasions staff do not always listen to what you are actually saying which is very frustrating. The surgery generally works to high standards. It does feel that there are not enough advanced appointments available and to ensure an appointment on the day you need to ring early which can be difficult when you work.
Debenham,Swift service with helpful staff,9/4/2018,5,Brilliant. You can get to see someone quickly. Staff are helpful and it all works really well.
Debenham,Temperamental check in screen,9/12/2019,5,"Professional approach, time to listen. Staff very good, they are polite both face to face and on the phone. The check in screen can be temperamental. Waiting for a general appointment is about 2 weeks."
Debenham,The Flu Jab event,12/10/2020,4,"To everyone who had a part to play in the Flu jab event.
Thank you so much for your work to keep us safe from flu.  Not a great day for the weather for you, but I hope you all realise the heartfelt gratitude of most of us.
BW"
Debenham,The nurses are very caring,9/2/2016,5,I find the nurses very caring and very happy to spend time with me. On one occasion they realised I was upset (not related to the visit) and so actually asked what was wrong and kindly spent time with me discussing the issues.
Debenham,The people make the surgery,4/25/2016,5,"The people make the surgery, they have very good staff. Sometimes the wait to see a doctor can be 20 minutes but this is understandable and doesn't worry me."
Debenham,The pharmacy has been great,9/2/2016,4,The pharmacy works very well and have been great with all my medication. They are very good at keeping me informed of any changes. The doctors are also very good and been very supportive.
Debenham,The staff are very pleasant and professional,10/17/2018,5,Easy to get appointments. Helpful in the pharmacy. Will deal with emergencies quickly. Feel you are recognised.
Debenham,They act quickly,7/8/2018,5,Been a very good surgery over the last 4 years. They give you good attention and once concerned they act quickly and its good that they look at everything holistically and think ahead.
Debenham,They look after me,7/4/2017,5,They look after me.  If I have problems they sort me out
Debenham,They need a queue system on the phone,9/12/2019,4,"This is a good surgery apart from the phone and getting access, the frustrating things is that the phone does not have a queue system on it so you can can redial 20 times or more only to be told there are no appointments available on the day, they put me in for the following Wednesday which was ok but I really wanted to see someone on the day."
Debenham,They will do home visits if necessary,9/12/2019,4,Everything is fine here. They will come out and do a home visit if needed. The car park is a bit small.
Debenham,Thought through service,11/22/2018,4,Everybody is polite and they do their best to get you seen. Getting an appointment this time was more problematic as the appointment has been rearranged twice but it was for something non urgent and a one off issue. Its a thought through service where you see the right person for the right reason. Its good that I get to mainly see the same doctor when I visit and he knows me and the issues I have. I've got my mobile phone registered too for the text messages which helps.
Debenham,Triage could be improved,6/4/2019,4,"My only comment would be that I wish the reception staff would ask more questions about what the appointment is for, as this would expedite quicker appointments for genuine need. I have had to wait over 4 weeks for this appointment and I really do think I should have been seen sooner."
Debenham,Triage system has worked well,5/8/2021,5,For me the triage system where the doctors call you back works well and it means you only visit the surgery when needed. It also seems to have reduced the waiting times to be seen when attending an appointment. The changes that have been put in place seem to have had a positive effect.
Debenham,Try to see the same doctor,3/1/2018,5,For ongoing issues I try to see the same doctor but for urgent issues I'd see anyone. The care navigation worked well on my latest booking but the future development of Debenham will cause problems.
Debenham,Unable to help but no advice who can,10/1/2019,3,I received a letter from the surgery after requesting help to get a wart removed at the surgery. I was told at my appointment that it would be arranged but when I received the letter it said that this service was no longer available. There was no advice about what should be done now or how to get it removed.
Debenham,"Unable to see doctor, are they still about?",7/10/2020,1,"Why, living in Grundisburgh do I have to go to Debenham drive thru for flu jab (just see on web site they are hosting one @ Otley; not offered)  and why do I have to pick up my prescription from Otley Surgery? Have they shut down the Grundisburgh Surgery completely now? Surely Grundisburgh is a larger village to Otley and therefore shouldn’t that Surgery close?"
Debenham,Urgent appointments available,11/16/2018,5,If you need an urgent appointment you will get one. Non urgent issues will take a bit longer but in acceptable times.  The service is spread over three sites which does allow you to visit those further afield if an appointment is more appropriate.
Debenham,Value the surgery and all it offers,4/25/2016,4,"I really value the surgery and all it offers, however, I feel there is always room for new thinking and improvement. The morning only booking appointments really doesn't work and I feel needs looking at. On occasions a GP has done their best with a situation/ condition but clearly a referral should have been made. We cannot expect our GPs to be capable of treating every condition and their have been occasions when a member of the family has needed to see a specialist ASAP. 
Also home visits are so important to those who really struggle with getting to the surgery - they sadly seem to be offered less and less. Encouragement to our ongoing practitioners"
Debenham,Very approachable staff,8/8/2018,5,Staff including the nurses are very approachable. I felt listened to when we last saw the doctor and they made a referral. Generally works well for us as we don't use the service that much. If you had an ongoing issue you would find continuity more of a challenge.
Debenham,Very friendly staff,11/28/2022,5,"I booked my blood test yesterday and feel that it's really good to be able to come in the next day. I spoke to reception and they arranged the appointment for me so it has all worked really well. I've also had a good experiences when using Ask My GP as I had quick repsonses and been given appointments when needed. The staff are very friendly and because I drive I'm happy to go to any of the three surgery sites for appointments. I feel they did really well with both the covid and flu vaccination programmes too, they went very smoothly. No complaints here."
Debenham,Very friendly staff,5/11/2021,5,The staff at the surgery in Otley are great and very friendly. The dispensary opening times are a little restricted so it would be great if they could be increased. I have had to send a photo for one of my mothers appointments but did feel it would be quicker and easier for her to be seen in person. But she was referred so from that point it did work.
Debenham,"very friendly, can get appointments when needed",7/4/2017,5,"Very friendly.  Can get appointments when needed, never have a problem.  A good surgery all round"
Debenham,Very friendly. Some delays in getting seen,3/30/2017,4,Booking in advance is helpful.   Like the friendliness of the surgery.  Waiting times ok but vary.  The later in the day it gets the longer the wait
Debenham,Very good,11/25/2022,5,I'm a fairly new patient and when we joined the staff were great at explaining issues and getting us registered. I've always been able to get appointments with a doctor whenever needed so I can't fault the surgery at all.
Debenham,Very good,8/8/2018,4,"Its a welcoming surgery, I get to see the same doctor most of the time, its very good. In the waiting room the chairs are very comfortable but moving the clock means that you can't now can't see it well. The signs asking patients to respect privacy is a good addition. If there was the space it would be better if children had more space or a seperate area."
Debenham,Very Good,11/17/2016,5,Overall the surgery caters very well for my needs and I don't have problems getting appointments
Debenham,Very good care and support,5/8/2021,5,Been very happy with the care and support provided recently. The triage process has worked really well with call backs happening quickly and resulting in the appropriate care and advice while undergoing cancer treatment.
Debenham,Very good staff,1/3/2019,4,I tend to come to the surgery to book an appointment rather than call. I've always got an appointment this way but  I wouldn't be confident I would when calling. I've had no issues with staff they are very good.
Debenham,Very good surgery,5/24/2016,4,"Very good. They have been very good, supportive and signposted well. All the staff at the surgery are great and are wonderful at explaining issues. The care received has been superb. the whole attitude and the holistic way they treat is great. The link worker at the surgery has been marvelous, she has been great making sure I get all the information I need. I've been very happy with the level of support and know I can contact her if I need anything further."
Debenham,Very good surgery can get appointments when required.,10/8/2017,5,"Very good surgery, get appointments when needed. Good staff, caring and can get to see who you want."
Debenham,Very happy with the service,6/4/2019,5,"I am very happy with the service at this surgery, no concerns. I have had positive hospital referrals at times. The nurse if very attentive."
Debenham,Very happy with the surgery,6/4/2019,5,"I am more than happy with this surgery, I can get an appointment easily and there is always a ring back option from the doctor or nurse practitioner if needed. Very good."
Debenham,Very happy with the surgery,4/25/2016,4,Very happy with surgery.
Debenham,Very happy. Usually get an appointment when required,3/30/2017,5,Very happy with the practice.  They've always been very good and you can get an appointment when needed.  Some receptionists are very helpful whereas others are not so much
Debenham,Very helpful,7/10/2015,5,"Living in a village with no other services - No bus to any GP surgery, so I rely on a car. They have good phone support, advice, contact which is important. Debenham group are good at this. Very helpful!"
Debenham,Very impressed,1/3/2019,5,"Been able to get a number of appointments quickly arranged and staff have sorted this all out for me. Generally the surgery works really well. The Otley flu clinic was very good, ran like clockwork in and out in 2 minutes. The car park was being carefully controlled and it all worked really well. Very impressed."
Debenham,Very personal approach,11/17/2016,5,Very personal approach.  The doctors call you back and you can have a real discussion with thm.  Good use of printouts and information as you don't always take everything in at the time
Debenham,Very pleasant staff,4/27/2016,5,You get to see your own doctor but may have to wait for an appointment. In an emergency I'd see any of the doctors and this would not be a problem. Getting appointments to have a blood test is not a problem and all the staff are very pleasant.
Debenham,Very pleased,11/17/2016,5,"Very pleased.  When I have needed an appointment I've got one and even on one occasion when there were no doctors on that day I was seen the next morning.  When one person has an appointment and a sample is needed, if known prior to the appointment, could reception staff advise of this, so that if the patient is reliant on volunteer transport there isn't any need to return very quickly with a sample incurring another trip, so it can all be done in one trip.  On one occasion in bad weather I was asked to go over to Otley for an appointment but I was not happy driving on the icy roads so asked for an appointment in Debenham when one was available.  It was a few days later but the receptionist would have preferred me to to have driven over."
Debenham,Very positive experience,6/4/2019,4,My experience to date has been very positive and me and my children feel very cared for here.
Debenham,Very supportive GP,6/2/2023,5,"It's a very good surgery and the GP I see is very supportive. When I had covid recently the GP I spoke to was wonderful, very sensible in their approach and made sure I knew what to do and explained everything so well and said what I should do if I was concerned.  They are always great."
Debenham,Waiting for a referral,11/1/2016,4,At the end of November my doctor informed me that I needed a knee replacement but I am still waiting for confirmation that the referral has been made. The receptionist is going to call me back to confirm what has happened.
Debenham,Well supported,10/11/2021,5,After doing an econsult I've had phone consultations that have worked really well and have been really quick and easy to get any problems sorted. Staff are good at explaining issues and I've been well supported and I was even called by the GP a week later to check how things were going which was great.
Debenham,"When will the Grundisburgh surgery re open, ?",3/9/2020,3,Is there public transport available from Grundisburgh? Drive through appointments no good without a car! We can walk to the Grundisburgh surgery.
Debenham,Wonderful GP,5/12/2021,4,"I should like to convey my compliments, applause, gratitude and regards in respect of Dr x (name removed). He couldn't do more for me and his attention to my condition was exemplary and sincere. Dr x (name removed) instilled such confidence and a duty of care which I found quite remarkable and personable. Please stay at this Practice as you are very much appreciated, highly regarded and respected."
Debenham,Wonderful relationship with my GP.,2/14/2021,4,"I absolutely trust my GP to have my best interests at heart and we have a great ""working"" relationship. Also find the nursing & pharmacy staff to be top rate. The only problems I come across with the practice are that it can be hard to get to see a preferred doctor soon (it depends on how lucky you are - the docs are spread over 3 sites so I do understand why), and occasional crossed-wires between medical staff and the pharmacy, usually down to me speaking to someone who doesn't know me, and computer glitches. Also the drug delivery to the surgery can be patchy for certain meds, but that's outside their control. They keep us updated when possible."
Debenham,Worked well,11/25/2022,5,"It worked well this morning when I used Ask My GP and after speaking to the GP I'm now seeing them too. I don't feel anything needs to change, it's all worked well."
Debenham,Worked well today,1/8/2022,5,"I called the surgery first thing, spoke to a GP and have been given an appointment with a doctor so it has worked very well this morning."
Debenham,Would change phone consultation,9/12/2019,4,"Phone consultation, this is quite new but I would change this if possible as sometimes it doesn't seem appropriate."
Debenham,Would like consistency with doctors,2/25/2022,4,"There doesn't seem to be any consistency with the surgery sites you asked to attend, some times its Debenham  and at others you have to go to Otley.  It's a little the same with seeing the same doctor, I'd prefer to have continuity as I wouldn't be able to say who my GP is, the care though is very good. I find that econsult works well when contacting the surgery but the system is a little frustrating as its not clear at times where certain information needs to go."
Debenham,Would like offer of face to face appointment,5/8/2021,4,"A very good practice generally, although I do feel I would like to be able to get a face to face appointment more easily. Having said that when you are called back by the doctor its usually promptly and the issues are sorted out with out going in to the surgery. The dispensary staff are very very helpful, getting items in really quickly even late on a Friday afternoon."
Debenham Group,A good staff team.,10/24/2016,5,Pretty luck with the surgery  A good staff team and all very approachable
Debenham Group,A good surgery with kind staff and doctors.,9/8/2017,5,"Generally works well, a good surgery. Doctors are all wonderful and reception staff are approachable, kind and caring. Lucky to have the dispensary on site. It would be great to have some more colouring in sheets for the children and a water machine in the waiting room."
Debenham Group,A great surgery,10/24/2016,5,A great surgery - works well
Debenham Group,A local surgery would be great,6/4/2018,4,"Having a local surgery is very important, I use the online system which works well for booking appointments. If it was possible it would be great to have a full time surgery in Grundisburgh."
Debenham Group,A very personal service,5/13/2016,5,Its a very personal service and they never make you feel like you should be leaving.  The receptionists are very friendly and will go the extra mile.
Debenham Group,Absolutely wonderful,2/12/2019,5,"They are absolutely wonderful here, its good to make appointments, outstanding service, they always tell me how I look on the day, they are responsive and caring, I am dealt with very quickly."
Debenham Group,Access is difficult,7/12/2018,4,Access is difficult with it being a part-time surgery and transport is difficult to then go to Debenham surgery
Debenham Group,Additional appointment needed,6/22/2018,4,Initially I was given a nurse practitioner appointment but they have suggested that I need to see a doctor now so I've had to have another appointment. I'd rather staff were honest and say when we need to see someone else but coming back could've been an issue. Generally happy with everything just getting an appointment can be an issue. It's important to have staff who listen as on a couple of occasions after being told no appointments were available and I've then explained the issue further I've then been given an appointment.
Debenham Group,All works well,5/13/2016,5,"I visit the surgery regularly for blood tests and to collect my prescriptions which all work well. I've never had problems with waiting times at the surgery. Having the flexibility of the 3 surgery sites is also great, although I rarely have to have an appointment at one of the other surgeries."
Debenham Group,Always fit you in,12/3/2019,5,"They will always fit you in, especially with the children but for me it can be more difficult. They will always offer a call back and fit you in if they need to see you, so generally it works well.  I have had an issue when I wasn't told the midwife system had changed so went to the surgery for my appointment as I had done for a previous pregnancy only to be told it was at another location."
Debenham Group,Always really helpful,5/13/2016,5,Always really helpful which makes a big difference. Our doctor always makes sure she spends the time I need with her and can't praise her highly enough.
Debenham Group,Ambivalent with staff,6/4/2018,3,Depending who you see it can feel like you're concerns are being dismissed. Some of the newer doctors are better. There is often a gradual decline in interest from doctors over the years.
Debenham Group,Appointments run to time,10/24/2016,5,"Appointments tend to run to time so very little waits.  Very local and very friendly people.  
I use the online system which works very well and enables me to book to see a doctor of my choice by visiting any of the surgery sites"
Debenham Group,Can get appointments when needed,11/16/2018,5,There's nothing at the surgery that needs changing. It's not quite as easy to get appointments as it used to be but you can get them when you need them.
Debenham Group,Can't always see the same GP,2/5/2019,3,Would be better to have more consistency of same GP. I don't like having to travel to Debenham for appointments
Debenham Group,Cheerful and helpful staff,2/5/2019,5,"Cheerful and helpful staff. Can get consistency of the same GP which is good. Very happy with referral for early prostate cancer.
It is harder to get an appointment with the practice nurse."
Debenham Group,Consultants letter not actioned quickly,5/13/2016,4,Following an appointment with the consultant the letter was not actioned and medication was not prescribed. This was only picked up when we queried the missing medication with the pharmacist. It then took a couple of weeks to get it sorted out. Then the GP called to say that I should stop taking the tablets as they shouldn't be taken with the other medication I am on.
Debenham Group,Continuity is good with doctor,8/8/2018,5,The continuity with the doctor I see us good and important. Getting appointments isn't difficult and I try to see a doctor at Grundisburgh if possible.
Debenham Group,Continuity of care.,10/24/2016,5,We try to see one doctor if we can to maintain continuity as he understands our family situation
Debenham Group,Difficult to get an appointment,10/24/2016,4,I've had to wait 10 days to see a specific doctor. Sometimes difficult to get appointments at this surgery and it's not always possible to get to the other surgery sites
Debenham Group,Difficult to get an appointment,10/24/2016,4,Difficult to get an appointment at the Grundisburgh surgery - am offered appointments at the other surgery.  Evening and weekend surgery appointments would be better.  Generally the surgery works and meets my needs
Debenham Group,Difficult to get an appointment.,10/24/2016,3,"Mixed messages are given by staff so you are not sure where you stand.

As a cancer patient I tried to get an appointment to see a doctor but was told the earliest would be 2 weeks.  It is slightly better now but can be a bit of a wait stil.  The amount of information provided depends on the individual and the doctors are very busy."
Debenham Group,Difficult to get appointment,5/17/2016,4,Its difficult to get an appointment with a specific doctor. I can and do go to Otley or Debenham if necessary.
Debenham Group,Difficult to get appointments,11/16/2018,3,"Its very difficult to get appointments, even to get a babies vaccination done has taken about a month. Its difficult at each of the sites and I've taken the first available appointment. Once you do see someone they are all very good."
Debenham Group,Difficult to get through in the morning,6/22/2018,4,"Very busy surgery and getting through on the phone first thing in the morning is difficult. It would be helpful to be able to book a couple of days ahead.  Transport is difficult to get to the other surgery sites the care has been good and staff are friendly, I'm included in discussions."
Debenham Group,Difficult to get to see doctor,7/8/2018,3,Difficult to get appointments with any doctor. With good doctors its beneficial to have consistency and the doctor I see is wonderful and really cares. When seeing the nurse prescriber they need to be able to prescribe a wide range of medication. The future use of online and email services is needed as waiting for phone calls can take a long time. If I can order medication online why can't  someone do the same by phone and even have a code word they have to give to allow this.
Debenham Group,Do a good job,8/8/2018,4,"By and large they do a good job. It difficult to see a specific doctor but seeing anyone means you can get an appointment quite quickly. Continuity is an issue though. I spoke to reception about a mdication issue, thinking i would need to speak to a doctor but I received a call back fro a nurse who sorted everything out. Telephone consultations can take 2-3 weeks to speak to a specific doctor. The dispensing side are excellent, staff are helpful and very accomodating."
Debenham Group,Doctors and nurses are great,5/17/2016,3,"Once you get in to see the doctors or nurses they are good but the availability of appointments needs to be improved. Due to my condition getting to another surgery is difficult and therefore more appointments here would be better. The booking system is quite difficult for me. 
I find that I'm given mixed information by the pharmacy. At one point I was told my son was eligible for free prescriptions and then I was asked to pay for his medication. 
The doctors are really great and the asthma nurse has always been really good. Even when you can't get an appointment I've been offered a telephone appointment and the doctor then says they will see you if they think you should come in. It would be great to have email prescription service for repeats."
Debenham Group,Doesn't take long to get appointments,11/16/2018,5,I don't come very often but when I do need an appointment I can get one when I needed. Reception staff are helpful and will do what they can . I only really come to this surgery but appointments don't take long to get. It a small village so there's not as many people trying to get appointments which helps.
Debenham Group,Don't wait long for appointments,11/16/2018,5,Its great that its such a local surgery.You can get appointments at one of the surgeries when you need them and you never have to wait long and for urgent issues you will get seen. Overall the care is very good and prescriptions are available on time.
Debenham Group,Enjoy the atmosphere,6/4/2018,5,Friendly surgery where you can get appointments when needed. Comfortable waiting room and warm. Nothing needs to change.
Debenham Group,Excellent - but explanations variable,10/24/2016,5,Explanations can vary depending who you see.  Quite satisfied with the surgery.  The service is very good and I get appointments when I need them
Debenham Group,Excellent - exceptional care and communication,10/24/2016,5,Very good.  When I've needed information they've always provided it.  Exceptional care has been provided.  Local surgery is really good
Debenham Group,Excellent - looked after very well,10/24/2016,5,Very local surgery.  I get looked after extremely well.  Very happy with the surgery and the NHS
Debenham Group,Excellent but rare to see doctor of choice,10/24/2016,5,I'v had no problems whatsoever.  They always been excellent.  To get seen by a doctor of your choice is difficult.  You can always see someone but this doesn't help with the continuity.
Debenham Group,Excellent local surgery,10/24/2016,5,Having a local surgery is very important.  It's hard to get through on the phone but that's because they are busy.  You will get an appointment if you need one
Debenham Group,Excellent surgery,7/8/2018,5,The one doctor I see is very nice. The surgery is exellent and great for me. Contiuity is important to me and I'm able to see the doctor I like. The reception staff are very polite and friendly.
Debenham Group,Explanations can be confusing,5/13/2016,5,I've been waiting for scan results for a long time. I'm one of many older patients who are unable to get out of Grundisburgh easily. Explanations given can sometimes be confusing.
Debenham Group,Fair but problem getting a GP to attend a home a visit,9/14/2017,3,After calling surgery for an elderly husband  lady in rural community.  The GP came out early evening but didn't use the 'Key safe' so turned back.  He had been told to go to neighbours to let him in.  Not much common sense shown.  He came back next day
Debenham Group,Flexible and accommodating staff,11/16/2018,5,"Having a local service is very important. If possible I attend appointments here but I will travel to the other surgeries if needed. Staff are flexible and accommodating and will try to fit you in when needed, so I don't  have issues getting appointments, you do have to have some flexibility too.  For routine things I try to see the same person but they are all very good. The facilities are all good and its not a very busy surgery. Its the small gestures and going the extra mile which makes all the difference. The dispensary has also been very good."
Debenham Group,Friendly and helpful,7/8/2018,5,The staff are friendly and helpful. It's always tidy and clean and they provide a good amount of information.
Debenham Group,Friendly and helpful staff,11/16/2018,5,"The surgery works well for me. You can talk to people and can get appointments when you need them at Grundisburgh. Staff are friendly and helpful and I've been able to get blood test appointments quickly, with results coming back quickly too. The phone message is very long and takes time to get through to the options.  If its an emergency option should be said right at the beginning of the message."
Debenham Group,Friendly small practice,9/8/2017,5,Never have any problems. Its a friendly small practice and I can get appointments. A radio in the waiting room would be nice.
Debenham Group,Friendly staff,4/5/2018,4,Having the flexibility to visit all three sites is good and having the dispensary on site is very useful. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Advanced bookings are very difficult for non urgent issues with any practitioner. The message on the phone is long and drawn out and was frustrating to listen to.
Debenham Group,Friendly staff,3/1/2018,4,I like that its a local service with friendly staff. Appointments can be difficult to get at times but care provided by nurses has been good. Phone consultations would be a good option as I don't really need to be seen but i do need advice.
Debenham Group,Friendly staff and good surgery,5/22/2017,5,Friendly receptionists at the surgery and a good surgery all round
Debenham Group,Generally a good surgery,10/24/2016,5,Generally a good surgery and the staff are all very friendly.  To get an appointment at any of the surgeries can be quite difficult.  I've waited a week this time but in the past it's been longer.  It it's an emergency they will fit you in though.
Debenham Group,Generally a very well run surgery.,10/24/2016,4,"I was given an option to see a practice nurse when a doctor wasn't available but I didn't feel reassured by the appointment but it was the best attention at the time.
Generally a very well run surgery"
Debenham Group,Generally works well,3/1/2018,5,"Very friendly, can normally get an appointment at one of the surgery sites when needed.  Sometimes when you call there are no appointments so you then have to phone Debenham to try and book one.  Generally works well."
Debenham Group,Generally works well,3/1/2018,5,"Having the local service is good, would like more appointment slots to be available. Generally works well, just wouldn't like to see appointments reduce at the surgery."
Debenham Group,Get appointments ok,10/24/2016,5,Get appointments ok and like my GP
Debenham Group,Get appointments when needed,3/1/2018,5,"Tend to book by phone, I will see any doctor and get appointments when needed even if it takes a week for non urgent matters. It works well."
Debenham Group,Getting an appointment is very difficult.,10/24/2016,2,Getting an appointment is very difficult.  I've had to wait 2.5 weeks for an appointment.  It has been as much as 3 weeks.  This is to see any doctor.  I tend to see locums all the time and you spend most of the appointment telling the doctor what the issue is and your history.
Debenham Group,Getting an appointment quickly can be difficult,10/24/2016,5,Getting appointments quickly can be a little difficult but you are always given the opportunity to go to Debenham
Debenham Group,Getting appointments is difficult,5/17/2016,3,GPs and nurses can be dismissive and getting an appointment can be difficult. I do not feel that full explanations are given and I often research on the internet to get more detail. I have a long term condition which took a long time to get a diagnosis and a simple blood test could have speeded it up. I do not feel listened to and at times I feel a nuisance.
Debenham Group,Getting appointments is not too bad,2/5/2019,4,Getting appointments is not too bad. Would prefer more consistency with seeing the same GP
Debenham Group,Getting home visits can be difficult,5/17/2016,3,Requesting a home visit can be difficult which means family members have to take time off work to bring me to appointments. Sometimes treatment explanation can be a bit brief.
Debenham Group,Good,10/24/2016,4,good
Debenham Group,Good - staff very helpful,10/24/2016,4,The receptionists are very helpful and this makes a big difference.  Debenham - it would be good to have more parking
Debenham Group,Good but don't get doctor of choice,10/24/2016,4,"Struggle to get an appointment and I rarely am able to choose who I see.
It can be challenging to have to drive to Debenham with the children to see a doctor.

Midwives.  Different midwife for every appointment and with a high risk pregnancy this wasn't good.
There is also only one day  when you can now see a midwife which doesn't always fit in with other things.  itte flexibility.  Midwife was seen at Grundisburgh"
Debenham Group,Good but hard to see GP as it is a part time surgery,9/14/2017,4,I find it difficult to see a GP locally as it's a part time surgery and I cannot always travel to the ones offered
Debenham Group,Good care received,5/17/2016,4,Overall we receive good care and there is good liaison with the hospital.
Debenham Group,Good communication,2/12/2019,5,"They communicate well, and listen very well. I came from another area and this is very positive. Staff very friendly both on the phone and face to face, front desk ladies are excellent. No waiting at appointment, I cannot fault it."
Debenham Group,"Good experience, friendly staff",2/5/2019,5,"Good experience all round, made to feel welcome. Friendly staff. Occasionally unable to get appointments on the day."
Debenham Group,Good face to face interaction,2/5/2019,4,When going online to book appointments it is a long waiting list but if you go in face-to-face they can usually get you in earlier. Also was asked by doctor to get a blood test booked with 7 days but struggled to get this at the GP's. There was a suggestion to go to the hospital to have it done but it's too far to travel. Managed to get it eventually at Debenham part of the group practice.
Debenham Group,Good local surgery,11/16/2018,5,Very convenient having such a good local surgery.
Debenham Group,Good rapport but difficult to get through,2/12/2019,4,"Staff have good rapport with patients, I have difficulty getting through on the phone and I have to wait often one and a half weeks before I can get a general appointment."
Debenham Group,Good service,2/12/2019,5,"I don't have to wait long to get an appointment, also I do not have to wait long to get called in. I would like to see dispensary deliveries from here.

Debenham Group,Good to see my GP with good timing.,6/4/2018,5,I like that I can speak to and see my GP in a reasonable amount of time. Quite happy with the idea of care navigation.

Debenham Group,Having the dispensary is important,6/22/2018,5,I get to see the doctor I like to see and can get appointments hen I need them. it's important to have the dispensary on site. The message on the phone is a little long but very clear and easy to understand. It's nice that the doctors come out to get you for your appointment.
Debenham Group,helpful,12/3/2019,5,"I like that they are willing to help me and sort things out. It can be difficult to get appointments at this surgery in particular, it can be 2-3 days to see someone. Staff seem to be polite and helpful."

Debenham Group,Important to have a local service,5/17/2016,4,The doctor I normally see has been great at explaining everything to me. Getting to a specific doctor can be difficult at the surgery but having a local service is very important.
Debenham Group,Known by staff,11/16/2018,4,Its nice that you are known as a person rather than just a number. Its a bit slow to get appointments and initially I was told I'd have to wait two weeks to be seen. I can't get on the day appointments but you can talk to the doctor about things if you're concerned.
Debenham Group,Like all the staff,3/1/2018,5,"I like all the staff, doctors and reception are all very friendly. Don't mind who I see really, you do get to know them and you can book appointments in advance. It all runs smoothly."

Debenham Group,Long waits for appointment with specific Dr,5/17/2016,5,There are long waits to see specific doctors as I'm not able to get out of Grundisburgh. The carpet in the room where blood tests are taken needs to be replaced.
Debenham Group,Lucky to have such a personal service,5/13/2016,4,"Very lucky to have such a personal service with all the doctors knowing you. My doctor prints off information for me which is great, this has happened when the hospital hasn't explained things. Sometimes waiting for appointments can be up to 1/2 hr late but this is not a problem as I'm given the time in my appointment."
Debenham Group,Messages not passed on,6/13/2016,2,We phoned the surgery to say we thought that our elderly mum had had a TIA as her speech had changed. She luckily had a routine appointment the next week as our concerns had never been passed to the doctor. He immediately put her on aspirin to help prevent a stroke but this a week later.  Mum also had a fall and a younger doctor came out to see her but didn't dress the wound on her legs but gave her antibiotics. No follow up appointment was made and we ended up having to call the nurse as the wound had deteriorated and her leg was incredibly swollen.
Debenham Group,Mix up over appointment location,11/16/2018,4,"Staff are friendly. There have been some communication issues, when I booked I was told one surgery but when I arrived I was told I should be at another site. I also didn't receive the text message for the appointment which normally happens and would've helped. They are fitting me in so I can get my dressing changed though which is good."
Debenham Group,More appointments would be welcome,6/22/2018,4,"Additional appointments in Grundisburgh would be welcome but I understandthat Debenham has the majority of appointments. The phone message is quite long and goes on a bit, I've heard it so much I don't listen anymore. Other than that the surgery and care is good."
Debenham Group,Need more GP's,2/12/2019,4,"We need more GP's, I would rather see a GP instead of a nurse practitioner."

I am registered for the text reminder service but I'm not getting a reminder on the day of the appointment.  Service for people who forget should be introduced to reduce the number of people not attending their appointments."
Debenham Group,Nurses are top notch,7/8/2018,5,"A very good surgery, a good standard of service, reception staff are friendly and helpful and the dispensary are great. The nurses are top notch, they are so friendly you are relaxed with them. The phone message is too long and drawn out and needs to be re done."
Debenham Group,Online booking works well,3/1/2018,4,Online booking works well for non urgent appointments and I like receiving the text reminders on my mobile.  Have had difficulties getting a child seen when they were visiting.
Debenham Group,Opening times not helpful,2/5/2019,4,"Otley's opening times are not helpful for some appointments, Particularly for blood tests. Would be helpful to be able to get more than 1 month at a time of warfarin medication."
Debenham Group,Overall pleased with the service,5/22/2017,5,Maintain a local service.  Happy with the surgery.  Get appointments when needed.  Don't mind visiting the other surgeries for appointments and get on well with my GP

Debenham Group,Perfect,1/3/2019,5,"Appointments aren't difficult to get I've see the the doctor recently and got the appointment straight away. everything has been perfect, calling in the morning works well and you get through quickly."
Debenham Group,Personalised service,2/12/2019,4,"I like the smaller surgery, it is more of a personalised service, if you like to see the same GP you can do this but you have to wait longer."
Debenham Group,Poor mental health support,8/8/2018,2,Really struggled to get the mental health support for my daughter.
Debenham Group,Practice and hospital liaise well,5/17/2016,4,"I like to see the same doctor for continuity but on occasions at the last minute this has been changed. I am also dyslexic so need extra time for explanations. The liaison between the doctor and the hospital has been good. I'm interested in the online access but didn't realise it was available, it should be publicized more."
Debenham Group,Pre booked appointments work well,11/16/2018,5,"Access and parking at the surgery is good, as is getting appointments. I tend to go to whichever site is most suitable when I call for an appointment. Mostly I have pre-booked appointments which works well. The staff are very nice and because I don't use the services much everything works very well for me."
Debenham Group,Prescriptions are quick and accurate,10/24/2016,5,Good parking.  Prescriptions are quick and accurate
Debenham Group,Pretty good on the whole,5/13/2016,4,Pretty good on the whole. I can't drive anymore so getting out of Grundisburgh is difficult. The more that can be supplied at Grundisburgh surgery the better.

I think my doctor is very good"
Debenham Group,Staff all very pleasant,5/13/2016,5,"If you want to see a particular doctor booking online enables you to see when and where they will be. All the staff are very pleasant and good to deal with. If you work only having the Thursday night late appointments makes it a little difficult, having an additional day would be good."
Debenham Group,Staff are very friendly,10/24/2016,5,It can be about a fortnight to see a specific doctor.  Tablets are always ready on time.  Staff are very friendly.
Debenham Group,Staff are very friendly,10/24/2016,5,Staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is good.  A good surgery and I would not want to lose the pharmacy in the surgery.  Improvement would be to have a definitive machine for asthma.  Having the information on the walls is really good too.

Debenham Group,Staff attitude can vary and sometimes hard to get appointment.,9/8/2017,4,"Staff attitude can vary depending on who you talk to.

The doctors are lovely, very caring and listen to you."
Debenham Group,Staff attitude is great,4/29/2016,5,"The staff attitude is great, very friendly. I tend to see the nurses who are really good and will spend time explaining."
Debenham Group,Surgery is very good as is the care.,9/8/2017,4,"The surgery is very good, care is generally good too. It's a smaller practice so not so well appointed as a large health centre but it is generally good."

Debenham Group,Surgery works well,10/24/2016,5,To see a specific doctor can take 3 or 4 weeks  Other than that the surgery works well.  Even getting a consultation by phone can be difficult.  Having consistency with doctors is better
Debenham Group,Taking too long for booking routine tests,6/4/2018,4,"Getting to see a nurse has taken 4 weeks for a routine test. If you need to call back again when its busy, you have to listen to the long answerphone message each time. It would be good if there was an option to skip the message if you've heard it before."
Debenham Group,Text reminders are helpful,5/13/2016,5,Can't always get an appointment quickly even with any doctor. I do get the text messages to confirm appointments which is helpful but I can't get to the other surgeries. When dealing with the pharmacy the attitude of staff can be a problem at times.
Debenham Group,The receptionists are very friendly,5/17/2016,4,It would be great to be able to discuss travel needs here rather than going to Debenham. Never had a problem getting to see a doctor and I like to see the same doctor. Booking online is really useful and its great to have the pharmacy on site. The receptionists are very friendly.
Debenham Group,The surgery is brilliant,6/4/2018,5,"Everything is excellent, polite and helpful staff. The message on the phone is a bit long but you can skip it. Having higher chairs in the waiting room would be easier to get up from."
Debenham Group,to see a specific Dr can take a while,10/24/2016,4,"To see a specific doctor can take a while.  I do try to see the same GP if possible to maintain continuity.
The surgery works fine.  Splitting the reception and the pharmacy has been an improvement"
Debenham Group,Treated very well but surgery chairs uncomfortable.,9/8/2017,5,For me personally I've been treated very well and I have consistency with the doctors. When I've needed a home visit they've always come out to me. The doctors know me well and are friendly. The chairs aren't very comfortable in the waiting area so could be improved.
Debenham Group,Very fortunate,3/1/2018,5,"Very fortunate to have a very good service.  The staff are friendly and its a nice relaxed atmosphere. We're very lucky. Booking appointments works well, I have no problem, the message on the phone is quite long when you call in."
Debenham Group,Very friendly,3/1/2018,5,"Very friendly, if you don't mind who you see there aren't long waits to see a doctor but if you do want to see a popular doctor it can be longer. Mobile phone text reminder works well as does having the three surgery sites."

Debenham Group,Very good staff,2/12/2019,5,"Very good staff at this surgery, good communication, they go the extra mile for patients. They make good referrals when needed, they also offer a phone consultation which I find very good."

Debenham Group,Very happy with this surgery overall,2/5/2019,5,Very happy with this surgery overall
Debenham Group,Very much value the service,5/13/2016,4,"Having a local surgery is great, I very much value having the service.
Waiting can be a little long its not a particular problem but it does delay the person who brings me. Sometimes I don't feel that I get full explanations from the doctor and I'd rather they spoke to me rather than looking at their computer. I like the one to one service which is more traditional than a lot of the larger health centres."
Debenham Group,Very satisfied with care received,2/5/2019,4,Very happy overall with this practice. Have been very satisfied with the care provided.
Debenham Group,Waiting times can vary,10/24/2016,5,Waiting times in the surgery can vary but it's a good surgery
Debenham Group,Waits for routine appointments are a bit long,2/5/2019,5,"Waiting times for routine appointments are a bit long, but am aware that they keep some appointments in reserve."
Debenham Group,Well managed,11/16/2018,4,Staff are friendly. It can be difficult to get appointments at any of the surgery sites and nurse appointments are difficult too and can take time to be seen. Its a well managed practice there are just too many patients to be seen.
Debenham Group,works well,1/3/2019,5,"Don't usually have to wait long for appointments and it works well, great."
Debenham Practice,A bit of a wait for appointments but OK,6/4/2019,4,"It's normally OK to get an appointment but there is often a bit of a wait, I feel the GP refers to the hospital specialists well and in a timely fashion. The nurses here are extremely good."

Debenham Practice,A little tricky to get appointments but good,6/4/2019,5,"It can be a little tricky to get an appointment and I can come to the surgery to book, I am happy to see any of the doctors though. I like my doctor, she's direct but very good. 
Can't fault the staff at all. When necessary we're happy to travel to the other site for appointments."
Debenham Practice,Accomodating staff,11/16/2018,5,"Having the 3 sites makes getting appointments easier and more flexible. I haven't had any problems getting appointments, you can speak to reception and they will try to accommodate your needs. The waiting times for prescriptions is two days however, if I take my prescription to a supermarket it can be ready by the time you finish shopping."
Debenham Practice,All excellent,12/14/2016,5,"All excellent.  Feel very comfortable  
Waiting times no problem because patient understands doctors busy"
Debenham Practice,All runs smoothly,6/4/2019,5,"Never had any problems at the surgery, when family have needed ongoing support they have been great, very accommodating and supportive of elderly relatives. The doctors have really chased referrals to hospital in the past when the hospital was slow to react. The dispensary is very good, accommodating and helpful with medications when needed. Reception staff are also great, if there are any problems getting to the surgery they will work with you on the best option.
The bus service to Debenham has changed so it's difficult to get to the surgery for appointments but I'm happy to go if I need to. 
I think we are very lucky at this surgery as you don't have to wait very long for appointments and it all runs smoothly."
Debenham Practice,Another evening,5/24/2016,4,Sometimes you have to wait a bit for appointments in the surgery. Having a split between pre booked and on the day appointments would be great and if there could be an additional appointment session on a Tuesday or during the early part of the week it would help.
Debenham Practice,Appointment availability is an issue,11/16/2018,4,The limited availability of appointments at Otley is an issue. You are given other options but they aren't so convenient or local. Staff are very good once you get in to see them and generally I'm happy to see any of the doctors. Having an extended walk in service at Otley to help people who work would be good as it can take two weeks to get an appointment here.
Debenham Practice,Appointment booking the only obstacle,6/4/2018,5,Friendly and helpful. More recently getting appointments has become more difficult but this is the only negative issue. Generally been very good.
Debenham Practice,Appointments not easy to get,11/16/2018,4,Having the local surgery is good but I don't find it very easy to get appointments at any of the surgeries. I do try to use the online booking but it doesn't help much.
Debenham Practice,Been delays getting medication,3/1/2018,3,"Been delays getting medication from the pharmacy. There has been a change and there is now no urgency to sort problems out, it just feels like they justify things. Receptionists are excellent and the GP I've been seeing has been great. getting appointments is particularly difficult at times and travelling to one of the other sites is not always possible."
Debenham Practice,Brilliant staff,6/5/2016,5,"Brilliant staff but it can mean you wait weeks to see your doctor of choice. They were great when I had a bladder problem, getting me the help i needed quickly."
Debenham Practice,Calling first thing is difficult,12/4/2018,5,Booked yesterday by phone but calling first thing in the morning when you work is difficult.
Debenham Practice,Can always get an appointment,10/16/2017,5,If I need an appointment they will always fit you in. They were very good when I needed treatment but couldn't get to the surgery
Debenham Practice,Can always get an appointment,12/1/2017,5,Can always get an appointment when needed.  Explanations have been good and it's good to have such a local service

Debenham Practice,Can be seen quickly,7/8/2018,5,If you do want or need a urgent appointment you will get seen but for non urgent issues it can be a two week wait. Getting regular INR appointments is more difficult now.
Debenham Practice,Can see the doctor of choice,8/8/2018,5,Good that you can see the doctor of your choice and the online system for medication and appointments works well.
Debenham Practice,choice of appointments,8/9/2016,4,2 week wait for an apt at Otley.  However I was able to have an appointment offered at Debenham as an alternative.  Very good service.
Debenham Practice,Choice of surgeries gives flexibility,5/24/2016,4,Having an alternative location to visit for appointments makes it more flexible regarding appointment times. Having more appointments available here would make it better though.
Debenham Practice,Comfortable seats,3/12/2019,4,"Its friendly and the seats are comfortable, no issues."
Debenham Practice,Continuity is compromised,4/29/2016,3,I feel that the latest problem I have has not been dealt with very well. Not able to see the same GP therefore continuity is compromised.
Debenham Practice,Delayed referral,8/8/2018,4,There has been a time when a referral to the diabetic clinic at the hospital was asked for but not initially done. Whether this would've made any difference I'm not sure but I feel it should've been done sooner.
Debenham Practice,Diabetic nurse wonderful,1/3/2019,5,"Very well cared for and conditions are well managed by staff. I see who ever is available and I'm happy with everyone. The diabetic nurse is wonderful, lots of information is provided. I can get blood tests for INRs when I need them and the results come in online. I've had a couple of telephone consultations which have been great."
Debenham Practice,Difficult to get appontments,6/22/2018,4,"Pretty good but appointments are difficult to get and I've waited longer than I would've liked.  Staff are very pleasant. Blood tests are also a bit delayed, 5 days on the last try. I've had to travel to Otley for this appointment as none were available in Debenham and this took a week to have one."
Debenham Practice,Difficult to get blood tests,11/16/2018,3,"Getting blood tests at the Debenham surgery is very difficult, its been nearly a month, it's quicker to go to the hospital. Blood results have also got lost which meant having another test. The nurse I see is very good and I try to see her if possible."
Debenham Practice,Doctors all know me very well,6/5/2016,4,Its a good family practice where all the staff know you and will help as much as they can. I tend to visit this surgery except for blood tests where I have done at the Debenham surgery.
Debenham Practice,Doctors and nurses are approachable,12/4/2018,4,Can usually get an appointment when needed. The doctors and nurses are approachable and competent. Generally works well and I'm happy with the new physio I've seen.
Debenham Practice,Doctors and nurses are excellent,6/5/2016,5,Doctors and nurses are excellent and very good at explaining things. A prescription delivery service would be greatly appreciated.

Debenham Practice,Doctors are good,7/8/2018,5,"The doctors are good and know their stuff, they explain things very well. The online system work well for prescriptions and everything works well"
Debenham Practice,Don't always get to see the same GP,6/4/2019,5,"I would prefer ore consistency of the same GP. I was disappointed that I didn't receive a call back even though I was promised one so I used the 111 service for advice. Reception staff are kind, it is difficult to get appointments especially the INR regular appointments. One of the nurses had 3 attempts at taking blood for my INR and she had to eventually get the doctor to do it."
Debenham Practice,Don't feel rushed,3/1/2018,4,"In the main its been useful to me, its a bit of a problem to see a specific doctor quickly but generally you get the time you need to see someone and don't feel rushed in the appointment."
Debenham Practice,Don't have to wait for appointments,11/16/2018,5,"Can get an appointments when you call, you don't have to wait.

Debenham Practice,Easier to see nurse at other surgeries,1/3/2019,5,You can get appointments quickly and the parking is quite quiet. It can be a bit easier to see a nurse at one of the other locations. Staff tend to be good at explaining issues and it all generally works quite well.
Debenham Practice,Excellent,10/16/2017,5,Very accommodating.  Registered family as a temporary patient very easily.No problems at all.  Can normally get appointment in a reasonable time and will fit you inif it's urgent.  Having the 3 sites is also a bonus

Debenham Practice,Excellent all round,10/16/2017,5,Never had any problems. Having the flexibility to choose between the three sites and I like the online booking system.  Generally works well
Debenham Practice,Excellent but getting appointment can be hard and long waits.,12/20/2016,5,"Getting an appointment can be difficult and I've been asked to call back.  Attending the other surgeries can be difficult as I can't drive.  Sometimes the waits can be up to 1/2 hour.  However, some people need more time than others.  The care though is very good"
Debenham Practice,Excellent care and easy to get appointments,3/16/2017,5,Quite happy to travel to any of the surgery sites and I'm happy to see any of the doctors.  Prescriptions work well as do appointments.  Use the online system to book mainly and always get an appointment when needed.  They look after my wife brilliantly.
Debenham Practice,Excellent very good,1/11/2016,5,Very nice staff.  On the odd occasion the waits for appointments have been up to one hour and it would be nice to have a staff member explain how long it is likely to be
Debenham Practice,"Excellent, clear & friendly",10/16/2017,5,"Good with the children,, clear and friendly.  Works well at the moment"
Debenham Practice,"Excellent, easy to get appointments",10/16/2017,5,"Go to Otley or Debenham and can get an appointment quite quickly. Doctors seem very good, feel very comfortable with the doctor when in the appointment"

Debenham Practice,Excellent. Staff very friendly and can see my GP,10/16/2017,5,Very happy with the surgery.  Everybody is very friendly.  My mother-in-law was visiting and after calling the doctor was out within 10 minutes.  I do like continuity and with my condition they will always squeeze me in if I need to be seen.
Debenham Practice,Expertise of staff is really great,6/8/2016,5,Friendliness and the expertise of staff is really great. All of the staff are wonderful and we're very lucky. Depending on how busy they are waits can be a little long.

Debenham Practice,Friendly staff,3/1/2018,4,"The friendliness of staff is good, easy access to the pharmacies and the opening hours are good also. Accessibility of notes allows locums to fully understand what the history is and how to proceed which gives you confidence. I think that it is a good idea to have the care navigation but confidentiality is a concern around discussing issues in the surgery reception.  You can't make a prior booking with the practice nurse but saying this I've never not been able to get an appointment on the day."
Debenham Practice,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,5,Staff are all very friendly. I called this morning and had no problem getting to see the nurse practitioner. Very pleased with the service
Debenham Practice,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,5,Staff are all very friendly and that makes the surgery
Debenham Practice,Friendly surgery,12/4/2018,5,Friendly and accommodating surgery who try to help you out. Its a little difficult at times to get an appointment but generally if you need one something will be available at one of the surgeries.
Debenham Practice,Getting appoinments is fine,6/4/2018,5,Like that you can book appointments in advance. You can always get an appointment when needed. A personalised service where by you get to see the same GP most of the time.
Debenham Practice,Getting appointments is a bit slower,7/8/2018,4,When I do need to use the surgery its fine. Getting an appointment quickly has got more difficult over the years but they can always see me. Online booking and prescriptions work well. When reviews are needed it shows on the prescription but you only tend to look at the prescription when you need more tablets and then it takes a while to get the appointment. I like the text message system in place for the reminders. It would be good to also have either email or text updates instead of being called.
Debenham Practice,Good,1/11/2016,4,Convenient surgery access but I do use the other site when necessary.  It's an improvement having the dispensary in the lobby area reception in the waiting area. Sometimes it's difficult to see a certain doctor quickly but I would be given an appointment if I needed an appointment with any doctor
Debenham Practice,Good atmosphere,3/12/2019,5,I like the atmosphere at this surgery it is calm and relaxing. I find all is fine here but the car park is a bit small.
Debenham Practice,Good but appointments hard to get,1/11/2016,4,Automated telephone system did not work well;  it kept saying an appointment was available but then it wouldn't book it.  I called the surgery in the end.  Online times for the Debenham dispensary are not up to date.  An update for the telephone booking would help.  Having a local service with the number of sites works well
Debenham Practice,Good but hard to get appointments,10/16/2017,4,To get an appointment can take time at any of the surgery sites. Like that it's a small surgery and parking isn't a problem
Debenham Practice,Good depending on who you see,1/11/2016,4,Depends who you see.  I have a good relationship with my doctors.  Having had lots of support I would never complain about the time people are given
Debenham Practice,Good surgery but a number of locums,6/5/2016,5,A great surgery but there are lots of locums which can impact on the continuity although if it's not urgent you can wait to see who you'd prefer to see.
Debenham Practice,Good surgery but Otley pharmacy never answer 'phone,11/17/2016,5,"Whenever you call the pharmacy at Otley you never get a response. I'd rather there was no answering machine.
Generally a good surgery;  nice staff"
Debenham Practice,Good to get emergency appointment but pharmacy isn't good.,10/16/2017,5,They have been very good at seeing me quickly when needed.  The pharmacy isn't as good as it used to be:  accuracy isn't as good and I've been given the wrong dose on one occasion.
Debenham Practice,GP is excellent,3/12/2019,3,"I had a text through from the surgery to say that my appointment was at Otley, I was under the impression that it was going to be at Debenham until the text. My experience of the GP is excellent. You do have to wait 3-4 days to get a general appointment. I would like my appointments to be in Debenham if I have the choice."
Debenham Practice,Happy with the practice,9/1/2017,3,Rather than waiting to get an appointment at Otley I've driven to Debenham which is not problematic. I've had to wait half an hour for my appointment but again this isn't a problem.
Debenham Practice,Harder to get appointments,12/4/2018,4,Its harder to get appointments now but I'm generally happy to go to any one of the surgeries. Booking in advance works well.
Debenham Practice,Have to call on the day for routine issues,1/3/2019,4,"Can usually get appointments when needed but the way on the day is organised now means that getting to Debenham for appointments is more difficult, especially if you can't drive. If you call you're told you can't book for later in the week and have to call on the day for routine issues.  Care and explanations tend to be good and I try to see the same person to get better continuity with ongoing issues especially and this usually happens."
Debenham Practice,Having the choice of 3 locations is great,5/24/2016,4,Having the choice of 3 locations is great but it would be even better if a late night appointment session at Otley was available.
Debenham Practice,helpful staff,1/3/2019,5,"Referrals to hospital are very good, a quick process generally and staff tell you what and when to expect to hear from the hospital. Staff are nice, friendly and helpful. If you can't be seen here you are given the option of going to one of the other surgeries. Generally it runs well and there are no issues."
Debenham Practice,Helpful staff,11/16/2018,5,I tend to go to any of the surgery sites  and this does help to get appointments when you need one. On the whole staff are very helpful but I do find access to the buildings with a wheelchair. I requested a house visit and this was organised easily and the doctor has been so helpful with everything.
Debenham Practice,Helpful staff,3/1/2018,5,Staff are helpful. It would be nice to know if the surgery isn't opening on a particular day for any reason and a text would be useful as it would prevent unnecessary journeys. Getting some medication delivered to the surgery can be difficult but staff did their best and offered an alternative.
Debenham Practice,Here for a scan,3/12/2019,4,"I have been sent here from Needham Market for a scan, I have never been to this surgery before. So far so good."
Debenham Practice,I always try to ask to see same GP,3/12/2019,4,"This is a good surgery, one of the GP's is particularly good, I always try to ask to see him if I can."
Debenham Practice,I am happy with them,6/4/2019,4,"I am happy to use any one of the three surgeries in the group. I have to book 5 to 6 appointments at the same time over so many weeks as I have an ulcerated leg. 
I am happy with them."
Debenham Practice,I don't like to travel to other surgeries,3/12/2019,4,"I would like to see more appointments available in Grundisburgh this would be better for me, travelling around to other surgeries is not ideal. However saying that I am quite happy with the level of service at Otley surgery."
Debenham Practice,I like the toys in the waiting room,7/19/2016,5,I like the toys in the waiting room.
Debenham Practice,Impressive service with helpful staff,10/5/2016,4,"Hadn't been to surgery in several years, so pleasantly surprised at how simple it was to get appointment. Didn't know the Doctor but very pleasant, helpful and informative.  Proactive in that immediately referred to Ipswich Hospital for X-Ray. When returned for follow-up did have to see another Doctor which does compromise continuity, but again they was very professional, friendly and reassuring. The surgery was clean, fresh and full of informative posters and leaflets. Friendly staff. I felt the appointments ran fairly close to schedule, as didn't feel I waited long to be seen. On both occasions the Doctors came out to call patients through (no buzzers) which I thought was a nice personal touch."
Debenham Practice,INR blood tests are difficult,7/8/2018,5,Not long waits for appointments.  INR blood tests now need to be done earlier now which is more difficult as the pick up time for bloods has changed. This is now difficult especially for older patients who may need assistance to get to the surgery.
Debenham Practice,Like choosing who I see,7/8/2018,5,I've not got anything to complain about. I've never had a problem getting an appointment and don't mind waiting to see a specific doctor. Its important to have the flexibility to choose the doctor you see. I use online for booking appointments and my medication and like that I can see my test results too.
Debenham Practice,Local and friendly surgery,3/1/2018,5,"A local and friendly surgery with the flexibility to use any of the surgeries, especially when continuity with GPs is important. They explain issues and get the level right, they give you confidence."
Debenham Practice,"Lovely people, who look after you.",7/13/2023,5,"The surgery is a great place, with lovely people, I would like to highlight the dispensary and the young man who works there, he always has a smile and helpful manner about him, give that man a pay raise. More work places need to take a leaf out of his book on customer care. Well done."
Debenham Practice,Never had a problem,3/1/2018,5,"I've never had a problem at all. It all works really well and you can always get an appointment when you need one. Nothing needs changing, it works so well."
Debenham Practice,New patients need to be given information,1/3/2019,3,When you register at the practice staff need to make sure new patients are told how to make appointments with in the surgery and out of hours. Care and advice has been very good from the doctors.
Debenham Practice,Nice easy location,3/12/2019,4,"Its a nice easy location here, this is my first time, we have been sent here as a referral from Needham Market as my son needs a scan."
Debenham Practice,No doctors available to see,11/16/2018,4,"I've struggled this week to get an appointments and have had to attend the different surgeries. I haven't been able to see a doctor as none are available. I've called a couple of times this week for appointments and they've gone very early in the morning. I've then been given a nurse appointment. Normally its good and not like this and staff are very pleasant and helpful. Opening times at Otley are restricted which does make things difficult at times, especially when trying to pick up medication."
Debenham Practice,"Nurses have been great, always get appointments",5/25/2017,5,"Really rate the nurses;  they have been great.  Can get appointments when needed and generally it works well, especially with the choice of surgeries"
Debenham Practice,Overall a good surgery,6/4/2019,4,"I will consider using the online booking system to book appointments in future not I know about it, I waited about a week to get this appointment as I wanted a specific day and time. It does feel a bit much that the receptionists ask more questions these days, but overall it's a good surgery."
Debenham Practice,People are friendly,5/24/2016,4,"People are friendly and the lady doctors are good. Doctors listen to you and give good explanations, its a good practice. Sometimes it can be hard to get an appointment especially here or at Grundisburgh. The standard response is there are no appointments. There is nothing that needs improving."
Debenham Practice,Pleasant staff and always get the time needed given,5/25/2017,4,Very pleasant staff.  There does seem to be a turnover of staff.  Like to see the same GP if possible and the three surgeries allow us to do this.  We always get the time needed in appointments.  We are often called in to help with trainee doctors which is great
Debenham Practice,Pleased with the service,6/8/2016,5,Pleased with the service provided by the practice
Debenham Practice,Polite staff,12/4/2018,5,"Always happy with the service, they'll try to fit you in, staff are polite and professional. Parking at Debenham is a problem may be parking at the Cherry Tree could be explored?"
Debenham Practice,Professional excellent service,3/12/2019,5,"I have been referred for a scan from Needham Market surgery. During the procedure I was made to feel at ease, discreet, professional and explained things exceptionally well, what an excellent service."
Debenham Practice,Quick to get appointments,6/8/2016,5,The convenience of being so local is great. Very quick to get an appointment and its great there is an on site pharmacy. Staff are all very friendly and helpful

Debenham Practice,Staff are very pleasant,6/4/2018,5,"Friendly, normally get appointments promptly. Everything works well. Having the three locations makes it easier to get appointments. New physio was very welcoming & friendly."
Debenham Practice,Staff attitude is great,6/8/2016,5,The attitude of staff is great they all have time for you and will listen. Sometimes appointments aren't available at the surgery so I have to go to Debenham but at least this gives me more options.
Debenham Practice,Staff keen to help,3/1/2018,5,"Really friendly staff, all keen to help you. We've been more than happy with the surgery as you can get an appointment. Also, like that reception staff are now asking what the concern is so that I see the right person rather than coming back to see someone different."
Debenham Practice,Staff Very supportive,3/12/2019,4,"Staff are very supportive. I would definitely recommend to others, I am more than happy with all aspects of this surgery."
Debenham Practice,Supportive surgery,6/4/2019,5,"Generally staff all listen to you well, I tend to come to Otley for appointments but to see someone here can take a week. Staff do say that if there is any change to call back.
Staff are very good, they will sort everything out.

The dispensary has been good, and if something is missing they get it for you in a week. 
Time is limited with appointments but staff are very good at not showing frustrations when people just chat."

Debenham Practice,Supportive surgery and caring staff,6/4/2019,5,"Easy to get appointments when needed, and the staff are all great.
They are so accommodating and helpful and really help you get the support you need, Very supportive of family members who have needed much more attention. One relative was called daily to check how they were and when things changed they really got the care they needed."
Debenham Practice,Surgery is great,6/5/2016,5,"Getting to see my doctor is difficult as she is so popular, the surgery is great though"
Debenham Practice,Surgery times aren't available,11/25/2016,4,Otley isn't as good due to the surgery times that are available. I did get a good hearing aid explanation recently.
Debenham Practice,System working well with nurses,5/25/2017,5,Like the way the nurses are being used more
Debenham Practice,Telephone consultations are great,6/8/2016,5,Having telephone consultations is really great as it frees up appointments in the surgery. The doctors have always called when they have arranged to.
Debenham Practice,Think they're amazing,12/4/2018,5,Think they're amazing. The diabetic nurse has been excellent. Checks are carried out annually and I'm given the information I need. It works well having the three surgeries.

Debenham Practice,Unclear advice,5/24/2016,4,A telephone appointment for urgent treatment was not very clear.
Debenham Practice,Understanding staff,6/8/2016,5,As there are three surgeries you can always get an appointment. Staff are always understanding and getting an appointment is not a problem. The surgery times are great with evening surgery times being helpful for my husband who works and finds it more difficult to get  to a normal appointment. Using the nurse practitioners is also a great service and frees up the doctors.

Debenham Practice,What I see is good,3/12/2019,4,"I usually go to Needham Market practice I am here with my daughter today for a scan. What I see is good so far, only observation is the car park is a bit small."
Debenham Practice,Wonderful treatment and support,6/8/2016,5,They always try to get you in as soon as they can. They are very proactive and go the extra mile to help. As a family we have had the most wonderful treatment and support. There is sometimes a bit of a wait but this is fine and staff attitude is excellent.
Debenham Practice,Works well,3/1/2018,4,Having a local surgery is good and having the flexibility to visit the other surgeries make appointments easier. Generally works well.
Dr. Solway,All good so far - hope it continues,7/12/2018,5,I've been a patient since 1992 - pretty well all been good. I hope this continues after the move. Geographically there wouldn't be a difficulty. No concerns re the move.
Dr. Solway,All pretty good,7/31/2018,5,The surroundings are a bit shabby now but are kept pretty clean. The people (who work here) are welcoming and I find it all to be pretty good.
Dr. Solway,All round they are pretty good,8/24/2018,4,I have been registered here since I was a child-over 30 years. They are all pretty good in my opinion but I don't think the nurses are quite as good as the doctors at explaining things.
Dr. Solway,Always a slight delay in being seen,6/25/2018,4,"I have been a patient here for about 18 years and it has always been pretty much ok. I have noticed that there is always a slight delay in being seen, and occasionally a significant wait."
Dr. Solway,Always been good,7/12/2018,5,"I have been a patient since before they moved here (1960s). Always been good. Re merger: Two Rivers is nearer than this practice to me. My daughter goes to Two Rivers and the booking system there is a nightmare, so would we retain our booking system?"
Dr. Solway,Always been looked after well,7/12/2018,5,Dr Solway is my doctor. I have been coming to this practice for years and I've always been treated and looked after well. Re merger: I can't drive anymore and I'm not sure if I can face using the bus when I am not feeling well. I will see how I feel closer to the time It seems illogical to me - why can't new patients be sent elsewhere?
Dr. Solway,By and large very happy,7/12/2018,4,"I've been here 51/2 yrs, by and large, very happy. I live in 'over 55' flats. Not sheltered but many of us are over 70 - some over 90. Most of us come here. I don't know if I can manage the journey personally and many of the people who live in our blocks will be in the same boat. I totally understand the need to move to accommodate training doctors."
Dr. Solway,Can be a slight delay,7/12/2018,4,I have been a patient here for 18 years and there has always been a slight delay in being called in to be seen-otherwise everything is OK

Dr. Solway,Doctors are very good.,8/24/2018,4,The best thing is that you can book a double appointment if it is needed. The doctors. are very good and I can get an appointment when I need one. Waiting time for a routine appointment can be up to two weeks but that is for a specific GP.
Dr. Solway,Drs and Nurses are lovely,7/31/2018,4,Historically the cleanliness in the waiting room has not been good. It is better now the old dirty carpet has been removed. There is good access to appointments and the Drs. and Nurses are lovely and good.
Dr. Solway,Drs. and Nurses are good.,7/31/2018,5,It is becoming a bit more difficult to get early appointments. Urgent matters are often dealt with the same day and routine appointments are usually arranged within the week. The Drs. and Nurses are good.

Dr. Solway,Getting an appointment is fine,8/21/2018,4,I am always late going in-getting an appointment is fine though. Changing location would be a positive for me as it would be closer to where I live. I've been registered here all my life-it meets my needs well.

Dr. Solway,I really rate both of the doctors.,8/27/2018,4,Sometimes I am bit late going in but I understand that. I really rate both of the doctors here. I have moved house while a patient but stayed registered here because they are so good. I have always had ;prompt referrals and good signposting.
Dr. Solway,I really rate this practice.,6/25/2018,5,Getting an appointment isn't a problem and I am usually seen pretty well on time. I have been a patient for over 20 years and they understand my chronic asthma condition very well and support me to control it so it doesn't take over my life. Very accessible.
Dr. Solway,I registered eight years ago.,8/21/2018,5,I registered here eight years ago. When my children were younger (and for me now if I can't get an appointment) I can get telephone support from a doctor. This is invaluable.Nursing staff are very informative as well.
Dr. Solway,It has been ok,6/25/2018,4,I have only been a patient here for the last 20 months or so and I haven't had much call to come in but it has always been ok

Dr. Solway,I've always been very happy,6/21/2018,4,I have been a patient from more than 40 years I can always see my own doctor without much of a delay. I am and have always been very happy to be a patient here.
Dr. Solway,I've never had any complaint,8/21/2018,5,I've been here for several years and I've never had a complaint about any aspect of the service. I will be a bit disappointed if they do move out.
Dr. Solway,Much about the practice is good.,8/24/2018,2,"Much about the practice is good. However, I have had a problem, which I have been attending for over the last three months. It still isn't identified and isn't being treated. The doctors don't seem to listen to me which is a shame as I have historic awareness of this."
Dr. Solway,My needs are met very well,7/12/2018,5,"Usually my needs are met very well. I don't usually wait to go in but I am a bit late today. Re merger: 1.) I drive so operationally it will be fine. 2.) I hope that we don't lose the personal touch, especially reception, as they look after you.... I will move to two Rivers."
Dr. Solway,NHS offers no alternatives,7/31/2018,4,NHS offers no alternatives-I have a thyroid condition and it cannot be well manager within the NHS. I have to contract privately for this aspect of my care. The people at the practice are all perfectly nice though.
Dr. Solway,Overall OK,7/31/2018,4,"I find there is a mixed quality of information from clinicians. With some it would be a one start, with some it would be five stars. Overall they are ok though"

Dr. Solway,Suits me well,8/24/2018,4,Coming to the doctors isn't something I think about except when I am unwell. Thinking about it now I guess it suits me very well because I don't have to think about it! I can't really think of anything which I would like to see changed or improved.
Dr. Solway,The doctors know all about me,8/27/2018,4,The doctors (and staff) know all about me and they see me straight away. They are great doctors and very supportive of my complex conditions.
Dr. Solway,There is not much here to improve.,8/27/2018,5,There is not much here to be improved. Reception staff can be a bit abrupt sometimes but that is very minor because everything else is so good.
Dr. Solway,Urine sample test result mix ups,10/29/2018,3,"Urine samples taken here are 'stick tested' at the time and I am told there are issues.  It then gets sent to hospital and they say it is all clear.  Four times this has happened whilst it was thought our child has an infection.  It was receptionists that were telling us wrong information, was we then spoke to the Practice manager who said something different. It fills me with little confidence and now in the process of changing as they are incompetent."
Dr. Solway,Very happy here,7/12/2018,4,I am very happy here.I live at Chantry so it will mean two buses not one.
Dr. Solway,Very happy with Drs and appointment booking,7/12/2018,5,I've been a patient all my life. Very happy with doctors. I can get an appointment ok. I would stick with these doctors. Its no further for me.
Dr. Solway,Very happy with the service,8/21/2018,4,I have been here all my life. I have always been very happy with the service and I have felt well looked after
Dr. Solway,Very pleased all round,7/12/2018,5,Very pleased all round. I don't have any problems with it. I can always get an appointment. I've been a patient for quite a while and I come on a bus from The Chantry. I would have to get a second bus and I worry about crossing busy roads so if there is a crossing i wouldn't have a problem. I still stick with them.
Dr. Solway,Very pleased with the service,7/12/2018,5,"By and large, we are very pleased with the service. I can usually get an appointment within the week. Good if it merges, it would work better for us as we live closer to Two Rivers."
Dr. Solway,Very pleased with the service,7/12/2018,5,I don't come often but I'm very pleased with the service. I would go to Two Rivers if I had to. No real concerns.
Dr. Solway,works well for my whole family,7/31/2018,5,"I am recently registered here - about 12 months. It is much, much better than my previous practice. It is a really good personal practice-it works well for my whole family."
Dr. Taylor,25 minutes late today,8/11/2018,4,"Today my appointment is running 25 mins late, which I think is not very good. I believe that GP's need longer for a patient as In the main you do not see your own.  So they need to read notes before you go in, which surely adds to the time needed."
Dr. Taylor,A patient for 25 years,7/1/2015,5,"They have  been the mainstay of me and my family for over 20 years - the  service could not be bettered. They  provide a fast, efficient response to all our general health issues,  support the very specific health demands of my disabled child, and have also helped me as family carer of a disabled child.  I could not ask for better, more supportive and integrated care from doctors, nurses, pharmacists and receptionists. It is also run very efficiently - referrals to other services are made fast, and followed up and  letters from specialists in different hospitals  are immediately scanned and put onto our notes, so no mistakes or loss of vital information can occur. All surgeries should be as good!"
Dr. Taylor,All excellent,3/4/2019,5,Always get appointment. All excellent. I feel a lot of that is put down to the excellent example of the lead partners.
Dr. Taylor,Always helpful,12/11/2019,5,I called today and got an appointment within an hour.  The receptionists are always very helpful too.
Dr. Taylor,always very helpful,7/2/2015,5,"very helpful, considerate and great service"
Dr. Taylor,Answer machine message,4/26/2018,4,I find the telephone answer machine message very long with different options. If you are aware of it I think there should be a way to skip it. All the staff are lovely here.
Dr. Taylor,Answer machine needs attention,8/11/2018,5,"Excellent service, especially the female GP's.  Only thing I would comment negatively on, is the tone of the answer machine message, it is rather droll"
Dr. Taylor,Appointment system,4/26/2018,3,"Getting appointments on the day is frustrating. I would like to be able to call and see someone the next day, but you always have to call at 8am on the day, and sometimes I am not well enough to do that at that time in the morning."
Dr. Taylor,Appointments running late,8/11/2018,4,"Today appointments are running behind by 15 minutes, which I know isn't too bad. I booked this one in advance to get test results and it was done efficiently coinciding with the results so reduces waiting and worrying."
Dr. Taylor,Been able to see my GP.,2/21/2017,5,Only twice in two years have I had to see anyone other than my GP
Dr. Taylor,Cannot fault it.,3/4/2019,5,Rang this morning and got choice of two appointments seeing my GP. Cannot fault it.
Dr. Taylor,Cannot fault them,5/3/2020,5,"I really cannot fault them.  I have to come in regularly due to 'warfarin' related blood tests and they always get me in quite quickly, as it is always at very short notice, depending what the hospital advise."
Dr. Taylor,Coming for many years,5/3/2020,5,"This is an excellent service.  I have been coming many years now and it has been consistently excellent.  Today I had barely sat down and I was called through, so running on time.  Staff are very helpful and caring."
Dr. Taylor,Couldn't get in waiting room,5/3/2020,4,"Although the service is excellent, it is always difficult to get into the waiting room with a baby in a pram.  I was here at the same as someone in a wheelchair and we could not both be in there as there is no floor space for both of you."
Dr. Taylor,Excellent,3/4/2019,5,Find the surgery excellent. I wish they had magazines as it's nice to have a little read while waiting.
Dr. Taylor,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Really good surgery.  I can usually get an appointment on the day I call them.  As I have my own transport I can travel to it.
Dr. Taylor,excellent,10/10/2016,5,very good
Dr. Taylor,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Staff are polite and if I'm ill I can get an appointment on the day. Would like free parking, that would make it great"
Dr. Taylor,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Always get an apt when required.  .  I came from Framfield - staff there were so rude - drs. and receptionists
Dr. Taylor,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I cannot fault the care and attention given at this practice
Dr. Taylor,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Dr. has been very caring and helpful
Dr. Taylor,excellent,9/14/2017,5,very good
Dr. Taylor,Excellent,4/22/2016,5,"Not having to use the practice often, I find that when I have to the response and help received is excellent"
Dr. Taylor,Excellent,11/11/2015,4,Excellent care for our family
Dr. Taylor,Excellent service,5/3/2020,5,"This is an excellent service.  Advanced appointments I get to see my own GP, but today for 'on the day' appointment I had to see another GP, which I understand and all was satisfactory.  They look after me well."
Dr. Taylor,Excellent service,3/4/2019,5,Whenever I call at 8am I always get an appointment 'on the day'. It's an excellent service. No faults to be found.
Dr. Taylor,"Excellent service for me, my husband 3 kids!",7/2/2015,5,"I had a hysterectomy 4 weeks ago. The support I had from my GP in arranging the operation,  the run up to the operation and afterwards has been exceptional. 
The practice is also fantastic with my three young children."
Dr. Taylor,Excellent staff,12/11/2019,5,Always can get appointment for regular blood tests.  All staff are excellent
Dr. Taylor,First time not seeing my own GP,5/3/2020,4,"Didn't get to see my own GP for the first time today. I am seeing a Locum, no idea who, which is slightly disconcerting, however with my Dr retiring I fear things could go downhill in this way.  The service has been impeccably good up till now, so I do hope it continues in the same way."
Dr. Taylor,Generally good,4/22/2016,4,"I find the level of customer care and treatment very good generally. It would however be good to be able to book appointments in advance more often, but I can usually though not always, get an appointment on the day when I need it."
Dr. Taylor,Genuine warmth,10/31/2018,5,"Generally a very good service. Prompt, efficient and with a genuine warmth and sense of caring shown by all there."
Dr. Taylor,Good,10/10/2016,4,Good
Dr. Taylor,Good and receptionists are excellent,12/20/2016,4,All depends on who you see  Receptionists excellent.  My GP is really good at calling me in for my flu jab and shingles vaccination.  I get letters aking me to make appointments for these.
Dr. Taylor,Good continuity of care,3/4/2019,5,Been here 25 years under same GP that I still get to see.
Dr. Taylor,Good support,3/4/2019,5,"Helped me and my family in difficult times when partner had cancer. Always told we could pop in anytime. Receptionists, whoever is on you always get a great welcome. Get appointment easily and very convenient, locally to me."
Dr. Taylor,Good that I can see named GP,10/31/2018,4,Surgery is very good overall with getting an appointment on the day.  I even get to see my named GP when I feel that I need to do so.  This is more in advance though.
Dr. Taylor,"Great surgery, no parking",3/4/2019,5,"Great surgery and with a couple of children we are here a lot. My only problem is that there is no parking, so I am having to consider a move to Framfield, but I am worried it isn't as good 'care wise'."
Dr. Taylor,Iin the main- really good,4/22/2016,4,The only thing I would say is that the staff's attitude can sometimes be suspect.
Dr. Taylor,Impressive service,12/11/2019,5,"I rang 'on the day' and got appointment, which I did not expect, so that is excellent.  I have had a GP come to my home too, and I know that that takes them so much more time, so I was grateful whoever I have seen here has always been excellent."
Dr. Taylor,"Local, responsive and professional practice",7/9/2015,5,"Have been a resident of Woodbridge for 20+ years and have always felt pleased with the service I received, appointments are easy to book (if you are smart about when you ask) and the treatment received has always been to a high standard i.e. when I needed several rabies jabs."
Dr. Taylor,May the good service continue,12/11/2019,5,NO fault I can think of for the more than 50 years I have been under this practice. I hope it can continue.
Dr. Taylor,NO APPOINTMENTS/ DRS IN HURRY AT APPMT,5/19/2015,1,"DOCTORS SEEM INTO TOO MUCH OF A HURRY TO GO FROM ONE APPOINTMENT TO THE NEXT, I NEVER FEEL I HAVE COVERED ALL THE POINTS I WISHED TO SAY"
Dr. Taylor,No complaints at all,12/11/2019,5,Always get an appointment when needed.  I have been referred to eye clinic too when needed. No complaints here at all.
Dr. Taylor,No faults- caring surgery,10/8/2016,5,"I feel it is good to compliment my surgery, and so I wish to express that they are caring and seem very genuine with it."
Dr. Taylor,Nothing but praise,12/11/2019,5,"I have nothing but praise to offer.  All staff are lovely and caring. Access to the appointments has never been an issue. ' On the day' or if need to book in a week or so it all happens easily, just excellent."
Dr. Taylor,Outstanding practice,12/11/2019,5,"This practice is Outstanding (CQC agrees!)
I have been under it for more than 70 years now and they have continued to bring through new professionals with the same ethos, which is why it has continued to be so good, in my opinion."
Dr. Taylor,Prefer this surgery than my previous,4/26/2018,4,"I find this surgery very good in comparison to my previous one which was not in this County. I can generally get an appointment when I need one, and all the staff seem happy."
Dr. Taylor,"Professional, caring and supportive.",2/21/2017,5,"Always professional, caring and supportive"
Dr. Taylor,Runs behind,8/11/2018,5,"I am happy here, but tends to run behind at appointments."
Dr. Taylor,Sorry GP is retiring,5/3/2020,5,Such an excellent service over all the years I have been coming here. Be sorry to see my doctor go.
Dr. Taylor,They are a great surgery,12/17/2015,5,You can always ring and be seen on the same day. We also get to see our own doctor regularly. I was referred to see a consultant very quickly. They are a great surgery.
Dr. Taylor,They should have investigated further,4/28/2015,3,"I had a blood test for a condition when feeling exhausted and unwell, the doctor said I didn't have that condition. A further blood test showed I do and I now know they should have investigated further."
Dr. Taylor,Very good,1/24/2019,4,"I have always found the surgery for the last few years I have been here, very good and easy to access.  They still have the 'personal touch' that has been lost in other places."
Dr. Taylor,Very welcomming,3/4/2019,5,Very welcoming at reception. Excellent care by all clinicians. Get appointment on day easily.
Dr. Taylor,Waiting room like a morgue,4/26/2018,4,"I cannot fault the care here but the waiting room feels like you are at the morgue. It just could do with something on, like the radio to help break the silence"
Dr. Taylor,"Whoever I see, it is great!",12/11/2019,5,"Always get access, and whatever GP I see they are great, but I do tend to request one specifically just because I feel that helps with my ongoing condition.  Most of the time I do get to see that person."
Felixstowe,Full Ten,11/18/2015,5,The surgery and all staff are 10/10
Felixstowe,Appointments are terrible,5/8/2015,3,Wait on phone 40 mins to wait for a 2 week appointment
Felixstowe,Appointments over the Phone Only!,8/21/2019,1,"Felixstowe Road Surgery is no longer booking appointments in person. This makes it extremely difficult for my clients who have very limited English skills to access the GP service as they are told thay can book only over the phone. Because of the difficulties they have in understanding or explaining themselves over the phone, they -along with their children- have not been able to access the service. The staff there are usually overwhelmed and they do not have a lot time to give to the service users who might need long time over the phone. Thus, the staff usually ask service users to call back with someone who speaks English which might not be an option for someone who is requesting an urgent service. The same service users have managed in the past to book their own appointments in person by bringing ID documents or using google translate on their phones but now they are not able to do so. Being unable to access the GP when needed is causing my clients to be stressed and anxious. 
I am requesting for the booking in person service to be provided again at this practice so it is accessible to everyone."
Felixstowe,Availability for appointments.,8/12/2017,5,Never a problem getting an appointment for my child. Less easy for us as adults.
Felixstowe,Best I have seen,4/8/2015,5,Nothing they wouldn't do for me or haven't done.
Felixstowe,Cannot ask for better service,4/29/2015,5,From the initial blood test to now they are on the phone after every blood test giving me advice and reassurance. Superb service from everyone including doctors surgery which does the twice weekly blood test.
Felixstowe,Can't fault,6/9/2016,5,Can't fault them at all - very good.  Sometimes appointments are a little tricky to get and the use of medical terminology can make explanations a bit unclear
Felixstowe,Easy to book appointments,9/1/2017,4,Its easy to book appointments and I like that my doctor is helpful.
Felixstowe,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"I don't use the surgery often, but can get an appointment when I need one"
Felixstowe,excellent,9/14/2017,5,The nurses drain & check my ears and they are very friendly.  My name shows on the board & I like that
Felixstowe,Excellent,12/2/2016,5,Dr. is very good friendly and efficient
Felixstowe,Excellent over the years,5/3/2020,5,"I have been under this surgery for more than 30 years, and they have consistently been good for me and my family.  Now I am older, they look after me well and I can get good information if I am worries about anything particular."
Felixstowe,feels like you are being pushed out the door,7/10/2015,3,Because timings are so tight it can feel like you're being pushed out the door.
Felixstowe,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,4,Reception staff friendly.  Practice nurse friendly.
Felixstowe,frustration of getting through in morning,3/3/2020,4,It’s extremely frustrating trying to get through on telephone in the morning when also trying to get children ready for school.
Felixstowe,Full of compliments,6/5/2016,4,"I can often get an appointment on the day. The waiting times are never too bad, usually up to 10 minutes, which is forgivable. I often ask to speak to the doctor on the telephone and I never have any problems with this."
Felixstowe,Generally pleased with the service,7/16/2015,4,I am usually very pleased with the care I am given. Would like the arrangements for appointments to be easier but realise it's difficult without more doctors.
Felixstowe,Getting an Appointment,7/10/2015,4,Walking up to the Drs Surgery about 7.50. get in the queue to be able to see a Dr on that day. As by the time you are able to get through by phone - all the Apts have gone. Also the wait to see a Dr - to 2-4 weeks
Felixstowe,Given GP +appointment,3/3/2020,5,"Rang today at 8 but couldn’t get on to the ‘holding’ part of the line. When I got through at 8.20 all appointments had gone. They did give me a GP+ appointment at Riverside for tonight, which is good, but really wanted to see the GP that knows me here."
Felixstowe,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Receptionists are rude, but doctors are lovely"
Felixstowe,good,7/3/2019,4,I go to the doctor with my mum and she explains everything to me.  I prefer to see a doctor and don't really mind seeing someone different every time.  Sometimes there are waits because there are other people
Felixstowe,Good - appointments and staff,8/12/2016,4,"When I need a home visit for my wife they always come out to her.  Staff are all very good with us.  
Generally appointments in advance are about 2 weeks ahead"
Felixstowe,Good discussion,9/10/2019,5,"Good feedback from recent MOT.
Good discussion about medication.
Clear precise information given with empathy and understanding."
Felixstowe,good for my child,1/30/2018,4,This surgery is good when I need an appointment for my child but not always for myself.
Felixstowe,Good with my children,9/25/2018,4,They are good at appointments for my children. I value that I can forward book for a routine appointment.
Felixstowe,"Good, but takes a while to speak to a person",3/4/2019,4,The most that could be improved is having to ring at 8am and wait for so long to be answered. I do understand that it is difficult as most surgeries are the same.
Felixstowe,I prefer to make advanced appointments,3/3/2020,4,"I had to book a 3 monthly check before Christmas but got told they were fully booked. I tried again in January and was told ‘you need to take this one,or else someone will take it quickly’. I did take it but meant I had to miss my exercise class. I prefer advanced appointments as I have to order taxi and I take quite a while to get myself going in the morning, as I’m not very mobile."
Felixstowe,Impossible to speak to a doctor,6/16/2022,1,"Ring at 8am, wait in queue for 35 minutes only to be told all routine appointments have gone. Only day off work and have to call on the day. Now got to do it all again next week. I am a menopausal woman with fibromyalgia that manages to work but can’t get an appointment, very unhelpful"
Felixstowe,Mixed experience,5/3/2020,3,"I used to be able to get in to the service relatively easily, but am now finding it more difficult to see who I would like to.  With ongoing conditions I would prefer to see a dedicated GP who knows me well."
Felixstowe,My appointment left me worse than I went in,1/16/2020,2,"I attended the surgery today and I was very unhappy with the service I received, I felt worse than when I went in. I felt i had a better chance of killing my self than getting the help i needed there. The sad thing is that it's just the one Dr that make the surgery not such a great place to go to. The Dr who attended me, just rushed through the appointment and I was talking about my deteriorating mental health issues and did not appear interested or did not show any empathy towards my plight. They were not giving me a chance to Express my self properly the appointment took less than 3 minutes. I was so upset and was shaking when I came out . I felt guilty that I could not stand up to the Dr for treating me the way they did. The services that they suggested I try are not readily available, the next appointment would be in March and I'm in January now. My current situation can not wait that long, I ended up turning down the appointment because I thought it's either I'll be dead or better from self medicating by that time... I will never go back to the surgery after this experience and its not the first time I have felt this way about that place. However don't get me wrong its not everyone it's a few individuals that spoil patient experience."
Felixstowe,My doctor is great,3/17/2016,5,I always see the same doctor and he is great and always has been. No problems with anything else at the practice either
Felixstowe,Never any appointments,3/14/2018,2,"Rang 46 times one morning from 8am to get an appointment.  By 8.25 when I eventually got through none left, happened the following day.  They will not allow you to pre book an appointment i.e. if matter is 'non-urgent' cannot book an appointment for next week - only do appointments that day and nothing else.  No help on the phone, called in and was told if I couldn't ring by 8.10 I had no chance (I usually drive to work that time of day).  Asked for a GP+ appointment, reluctantly gave one but for five days later. Don't release appointments on SystemOne online.  GPs are great, reception team rude, have zero empathy and their system is not patient focussed.   As I left the practice, having got a five day wait for apt, an obese smoker walked in asked for an appointment and was given one for that morning.  I asked why I could not have had that appointment and was told some slots were reserved and could be allocated at the receptionists' discretion.  Clearly the worried well, people who work, and those who attend less frequently the practice is not interested.  Patients with co-morbidities are seen as 'regulars' who clearly have slots reserved for them.  My apt with GP+ was great but sadly turns out I have suspected cancer and was put appropriate pathway - no thanks to Felixstowe Road."
Felixstowe,No review - Only ratings provided,7/16/2015,5,No review - Only ratings provided
Felixstowe,Not always easy to get appointments,7/12/2017,5,"Mum books my appointments, sometimes not easy to get an appointment. I do have to wait a long time but I like that I see the same doctor, he is nice."
Felixstowe,Overall ok,5/3/2020,3,"Things overall are ok.  I think the place needs a bit of updating, as it does feel quite depressing.  You can hear everything reception says to patients, which is not good for confidentiality. They should be offering written info as an option if they can do nothing about the voices carrying.
I'd like some music/radio on, it may help with the feel of the place a bit."
Felixstowe,Pleased with my doctors,12/8/2016,4,If I need to see someone I can and getting an appointment is not a problem. Only once have I had to wait for 30 minutes to be seen. I like it when my doctor talks to me about what I need and I'm pleased with my doctors as they've helped me a lot. At times I don't get enough information.
Felixstowe,Pleased with the appointment system,8/16/2018,4,"I spoke to receptionist to book an appointment, asked what it was for and said they would get on-call GP to give me a call. She did and I was seen within the half hour."
Felixstowe,Polite staff.  Helpful Doctors and Nurses,11/5/2022,4,"The only thing I would say is ""we need to get appointments to see the Doctors.  The booking system needs updating ASAP. Also the Web site is a bit old fashion needs updating."
Felixstowe,Reception can be brusk,5/3/2020,4,"I do not mind being asked about things by reception, but there is a way of talking to patients, and sometimes one particular Receptionist can be pretty brusk.  It is not necessary."
Felixstowe,Rude and demeaning staff,4/12/2019,1,"If you are lucky enough to get through to reception in the morning you then have to be ridiculed by the receptionists into giving them information before being allowed an appointment. After booking an appointment this morning, getting through after numerous tries, I was insulted by the receptionist who insinuated that I was incorrect (about my own health!!) and that I should look up the correct terminology. Disgusted."
Felixstowe,Rude Reception,7/5/2021,1,Forever redialing to even speak to someone. When you get through they are snobby.
Felixstowe,See same midwife is great,1/30/2018,5,"I have seen the same midwife throughout my pregnancy which is great, as i know this is not always the case. I would have like to get onto the 'hypnobirthing' but it was full. More places are needed as it is becoming more popular."
Felixstowe,Sometimes a slight wait,1/9/2017,5,There is sometimes a slight delay in being called in to see the Doctor but not enough to be considered a problem.
Felixstowe,Supportive,7/12/2018,5,GP has come out to see me every other week. The way he talks to me makes sense. Excellent receptionists.
Felixstowe,They truly do care,2/22/2018,5,"I ran out of my repeat prescription tablet because I failed to put in a request. I rang the practice at 5:30 on a Friday to see if there is anything they can do. The receptionist explained my situation to the duty doctor and called me back to say that a prescription will be ready for collection, but I would need to get there before they shut at 6. I got there at 5:45 and picked up the prescription. I'm ever so grateful!"
Felixstowe,Very poor . Long wait for a reply.,2/19/2021,2,"I have been very satisfied with the practice for 41 years until 2 years ago when the response to an early morning call for an appointment starting at 8am could take 20 mins then all appointments had gone. If contact was made a  "" care navigator "" would decide on if/when seeing a doctor or nurse . Also the staff could be surly. A massive change from the experience of the first 41 years at the practice. A shame."
Felixstowe,Very professional,5/5/2020,5,Initial same-day appointment: medication prescribed: quick hopital appointment (minor surgery): 70 daily nurses appointments including Bluebird Lodge at week-ends.  Outstanding care.
Felixstowe,Waiting room atmosphere,5/3/2020,4,"Find the waiting room like a morgue as it is so quiet.  You can therefore hear everything someone says at reception.  Just feels uncomfortable.  The service however, is excellent, with caring clinical staff.  Although I do not use the surgery much, I can get in when I need to."
Felixstowe,Wheelchair access isn't easy in the building,6/13/2016,4,It is difficult to get an appointment. It can depend who you see but staff are generally helpful. Access to some rooms is very difficult in a wheelchair. The disabled access toilet at the surgery has a bar by the toilet that doesn't move and it is too far forward for people to easily transfer from a chair to the toilet. I have raised this with the practice manager (a few years ago).
Felixstowe,Works for me,5/3/2020,4,"I do not mind who I see when I am ill.  I do not have any long term conditions, so it does not concern me if I do not see my own GP.  If that changes then I think I will feel differently.  But things work for me currently"
Forest,45 mins wait on the phone is too long,11/15/2019,3,"I phoned this morning and I had to wait 45mins before the phone was answered, it is just too long. I think the staff must be under too much pressure with too many patients."
Forest,5 star,9/16/2015,5,5 star
Forest,Absolutely fine - all good!,7/5/2018,5,"Absolutely fine, now all my needs are fully met. Appointments are no problem - all good."
Forest,Absolutely wonderful,10/31/2022,4,Having the HCA to take bloods at the surgery now is a great improvement as I had previously been asked to travel to the Mildenhall hub to get them done. I really rate the surgery and the staff as they have been very supportive and caring.
Forest,All v. good but walls could do with painting,7/5/2018,5,It's all very good here - much better than used to be the case - but the walls could really do with painting.
Forest,Always good,4/11/2022,5,I called first thing this morning and I've been seen by a doctor. They've told me to self-refer to physio for treatment. I don't use the surgery much but when I do it's always good and I like the staff as they are friendly and approachable.
Forest,appointment,4/11/2022,3,"I've struggled to get a more urgent appointment and do believe that continuity is really key and this is missing at times. I've had to wait 4 weeks to speak to a doctor about some results, which is a long time when you are worried. For regular blood tests you're asked to go to Newmarket or West Suffolk hospital which is a long way and would be better if it was at the surgery."
Forest,Appointment & waiting time could be improved,6/28/2018,4,I'm self-employed and block time off to come in. I am currently 20 mins late. I have waited a month to see a particular doctor. I come regularly and book in advance.
Forest,Better over time,12/10/2018,5,I have been a patient here for just over 20 years. It has got better over that time-pretty good now.Not perfect-they ran out of flu serum before I had my jab. They wouldn't do me in the 64 year old group (though I am 64!) because my birthday was after 31st March. Otherwise nothing  much to complain about.
Forest,Better over time.,9/18/2018,5,I have been a patient for many years and unlike most services in Brandon this surgery has gotten better over time. Access to appointments is easier and doctors seem more competent to me. Bit scruffy in the waiting room though.
Forest,Better than before but!,10/15/2015,3,I had to wait over 2 hours for an urgent same day appointment.
Forest,Can be a lengthy wait once you are here,12/2/2020,3,Can be a lengthy wait once you are here but the surgery itself is fine and the staff are friendly and helpful.
Forest,Can take a while to get routine appointment,12/2/2020,4,"It can take a while to get a routine appointment and that is with any doctor, (the option of using Econsult to contact the doctor has been explained today)"
Forest,Caring and kind,4/10/2015,4,They do their best to get a quick appointment for you but if they can't a doctor calls back.
Forest,Clinical side is great but hard to get appointments.,10/16/2017,5,I am very pleased with them generally-appointments are not that easy to get however. That said I wouldn't want to go anywhere else as the clinical side is great
Forest,Contacting the surgery is fine,10/31/2022,4,"Contacting the surgery is fine and the doctor I tend to see if possible is great and overall I'm very pleased with how all the staff are. Reception staff are pleasant and helpful when they are dealing with you. The prescription line is busy and I've left a message but they haven't come back to me and I have found it a little slow to get things done. I don't particularly like having to go to Mildenhall, Newmarket or West Suffolk hospital to have blood tests, it's a lot of extra miles for regular blood tests and it would be better if they could be done at the surgery."
Forest,Could be better organised,11/5/2018,3,It used to take a long time to get an appointment (I have now left the Practice) to see a clinician. I didn't find the staff very friendly or helpful. It seemed a bit chaotic and I think they could have been better organised.
Forest,Difficult to obtain appointments,3/12/2018,3,It is difficult to obtain appointments but probably better than it was a few years back. Generally the practice seems to have improved and is now OK in my experience. One of the things that hasn't improved though is that I now do not often see the same GP twice which I think is not great when dealing with a chronic and ongoing condition.
Forest,Doctors and nurses all seem very competent,3/1/2019,4,The waiting room is so full today-so busy and the staff are still friendly and smiling! Folk seem to be going in and out reasonably quickly though. Some arrive and go in very quickly and some seem to have to wait quite a while (me being one of them!). I think the nurses run better to time than the doctors but appointments here aren't too bad to get. I have to say that the doctor and nurses all seem very competent and I feel well looked after.
Forest,Doctors and Nurses are excellent,1/29/2020,5,"The doctors and nurses at this surgery are brilliant, apart from one, but I will not let one bring the rest down. They are always trying to do the best by their patient and they unfortunately do run behind which is understandable."
Forest,Doctors and nurses are pretty good,9/18/2018,4,Doctors and nurses are pretty good. It would be nice to get a routine appointment a bit quicker and I am sometimes a bit late being called in. My big criticism is the state of the premises. Large areas of plaster are visible through the paint in the waiting room-if looks shabby and let’s the place down.
Forest,Doctors and nurses are so good.,3/1/2019,4,The doctors and nurses here are so good.This practice has improved a lot overall in the last few years. It could do with a lick of paint and routine appointments could be a bit quicker but everything considered I am quite happy here.
Forest,Doctors are good,12/10/2018,4,"Generally my experiences have been good or very good. Punctuality is better for blood tests than GP appointments but I guess you would expect that. Waiting room blinds are a bit tatty and a lick of paint would be good. The only significant thing really is that the reception desk is very close to the waiting area so anything you say to receptionist is overheard,"
Forest,Doctors very good here,11/15/2019,5,"I think the doctors are very good here. It is difficult to get through on the phone, sometimes up to 45 mins. You can have to wait up to an hour before you get called in to the doctors room which is too long. I do feel the doctors seem stressed because the surgery is so busy."
Forest,Dr who looked after my son was good,8/29/2018,3,I've never been seen here on time. That said the doctor who looked after my son when he was unwell was good and the doctor who looks after my mother is fantastic!
Forest,Drs very good,3/12/2018,5,The reception staff could be a bit less abrupt though not all of them and not always. It has been a better experience since Swan Surgery took over. Easier for appointments and the doctors are very good. It is now a very well run place.
Forest,Excellent GP - very thorough,4/4/2017,5,"Willing to wait as my doctor is so thorough - time doesn't matter,  Nearly always 1 hour late but I don't mind"
Forest,Excellent service all round,7/31/2015,5,5 star
Forest,Feel a bit rushed sometimes,12/2/2020,3,"Waiting times to be seen varies really, I do feel a bit rushed at times in the doctors room, I feel the GP attitude could be a bit more approachable to me to allow me to feel more comfortable. (the option of using Econsult as another way to contact the doctor was explained to me today)"
Forest,Forest surgery is terrible!,4/29/2021,1,"Receptions totally unhelpful/ rude and don't contact/phone you back. Can't get bloods taken here, you have to go to bury or somewhere else also no antenatal care. Only good thing is the doctors are nice and helpful"
Forest,Friendly and professional,8/29/2018,4,"It can be pretty warm in the waiting room-especially in the recent hot weather. Staff are both friendly and professional-especially the reception staff! The doctor that I see is great, I have so much confidence in their ability"
Forest,Friendly staff and get appointment ok,7/5/2018,5,I don't come very often but I usually get an appointment ok and all staff reception and nurses are friendly.
Forest,Generally pleased with care,7/5/2018,4,"I have a number of complex health conditions and there is one special doctor I value. On one occasion, another doctor wasn't very thorough. All round is ok."
Forest,Generally pleased with the care service,6/28/2018,5,"I'm always late being called in. It is a very, very busy little surgery. Everything else is pretty much ok though. It would be nice if they could paint the walls though."
Forest,Generally pleased wth care received,6/28/2018,4,"I phoned today and got an emergency on the day - good. Routine is 2 to 3 weeks, which isn't so good. I have children and so come in a fair bit. always 20 to 30 minutes wait."
Forest,Getting an appointment can be difficult,12/2/2020,3,"Getting an appointment can be difficult, I am asked to call back at a certain time later in the day but then I am told there are no appointments available and I have to start the process again the next day."
Forest,Getting an appointment is good,12/2/2020,5,"Getting an appointment is good here, I really cannot think of any improvements needed,"
Forest,Good GP consistency,12/2/2020,5,"Either by phone or online I find making an appointment works well for me, I have waited over 30mins to be called through to be seen by the GP on occasions, but I get a good consistency of the same GP which is important to me."
Forest,Good surgery overall,11/15/2019,5,Its a good surgery overall. It would be helpful to have automatic doors.
Forest,GPs always run 45 to 90 minutes late,7/5/2018,2,"Nurse practitioner sees me on time but GPs always run late, 45 to 90 minutes isn't unusual. I had to call my husband to come and collect my children once! Called this morning and got appointment for this afternoon"
Forest,Great,10/31/2022,5,Surgery and staff are great and the system in place works well. I've been in and out quickly and have an appointment for tomorrow after talking to reception. I'm very pleased with everything here as it's easy to get seen when needed.
Forest,Great clinical staff,10/18/2018,5,"I have been a patient here for some years and I would have to say that my experience is that currently the clinical staff are great. The rest of it (premises, admin, appointments) isn't as good but I would rate all that as still OK."
Forest,Helpful practice,10/21/2022,4,"Always found my GP practice on the whole helpful, although waiting time on the phone can be a long wait!"
Forest,I am very happy,8/29/2018,5,I have felt well supported through my pregnancy and I am very happy now that I have my baby with all the checks/advice I get. It is all good for me and I couldn't have asked for more.
Forest,I feel very well looked after.,2/21/2017,5,I can get an appointment easily because I am on warfarin.  I feel very well looked after.
Forest,I like my doctor,12/2/2020,5,I like my doctor very much but I do find the dispensary staff to be rude in her attitude. I prefer to use the staff at the desk to check in rather than using the screen.
Forest,I rely on a Community Car to bring me,11/14/2019,4,"We have been coming here for 25 years, our current doctor we like. You have to wait about a month for an appointment and I rely on a community car to bring me up. I wish they would have more appointments in Mundford which is a surgery they set up in the village hall."
Forest,I think it is excellent,3/1/2019,4,I pretty much always have to wait a bit after my appointment time but it is a very busy little practice.It's not usually more than a 15-20 minute wait which I don't think is unreasonable given what they do. I am feeling quite unwell today and I have managed to get an appointment which I think is excellent this close to the Christmas break.
Forest,I'm happy with the service,8/29/2018,4,I seem to be able to get an appointment ok when I need one. It is much better under the new doctors and I am happy with the service
Forest,Impossible to get any one to answer phone.,8/27/2021,1,"45 mins and still no answer on phone, still no face to face appointments even though physio and hospital are seeing people. When I did get through, still using the excuse that they are short staffed because of COVID. 18 months now they have said this. Can't get to see or speak to a regular Dr, no continuity in care. They were good when Swan first took them over. Now it seems Forest are just a thorn in their side."
Forest,Improving,4/10/2015,4,Much improved since being taken over by Swan.
Forest,Information provided re Covid vaccination,3/17/2021,5,Needed information following bad reaction to first Covid vaccine. Good explanation provided re 2nd vaccination and help offered to help with any reaction to that.
Forest,It's been fantastic since takeover by SWAN,7/5/2018,5,Since SWAN took over the surgery it is now fantastic. I phoned today with a bad eye and got an appointment this afternoon. You can't ask for more than that.
Forest,It's pretty good all round,3/12/2018,5,It's pretty good all round. I am 15 minutes late in being seen today but that is unusual. I booked this appointment (22nd Nov.) on Nov. 5th. I could have seen a nurse a bit sooner but it would still have been about a week and a half.
Forest,Language isn't a difficulty,3/1/2019,4,"My first language is Polish but language isn't a difficulty for me. I can manage by myself for routine stuff and if it is something more complicated I bring a friend to translate for me. It works well. Today I have had a blood test and I was in and out in just a few minutes. So quick and professional, I think this is a very good service here."
Forest,Long time before phone is answered,11/14/2019,4,"Overall I'm happy with the surgery, I wish I didn't have to wait so long for the phone to be answered."
Forest,Looked after very well,4/4/2017,4,Look after me very well.  Got an appointment on the day not long ago.Saturday opening is good.  Reception staff have improved
Forest,medically great,12/10/2018,4,The waiting room is kept clean but it is so shabby it is a bit depressing to sit in. Doctors and nurses are medically great but nurses keep to time better than the doctors. What is very good is that I can usually get an appointment within three days. I also like that blood tests are done in house and I don't have to travell.
Forest,Mixed experience with doctors,7/25/2018,2,Emergency appointment on the Thurs - Dr was rushed and I had to fight to get the emergency appointment. Dr didn't really pick up on severity - gave a prescription. Got worse - 1) TRIAGE - got a Dr to call back. 2) Dr called very quickly - promised a home visit 10.00 pm that night. 3) Dr visited - he was excellent and very friendly - gave injection and told us to come back to GP to review Meds. It has taken 3 weeks to get an appointment.
Forest,More than happy to be a patient here,7/5/2018,5,There can be a slight delay in being seen but that is quite understandable. I am more than happy to be a patient here.
Forest,Much improved,3/12/2018,4,"The waiting room needs re-decorating, it really is quite shabby. Staff and doctors are all pretty good though, listen to me and respond clearly to my concerns. I got this appointment on the day today which is pretty good. The practice is much improved over time."
Forest,Much improved,10/16/2017,5,I have been a patient here for some years. There is not much choice-only one other practice-and historically it has been a bit hit and miss. It is now much more modern and better than it used to be.
Forest,Much improved,4/4/2017,4,Much improved since Swan Surgery took over
Forest,Much improved,7/31/2015,5,Much improved in last 2 years.
Forest,Much improved of late,8/29/2018,4,I have been registered here all of my life. My scores would have been much lower a few years ago but the whole practice is much improved of late. Even the staff seem happier now.
Forest,Much improved since Swan took over,6/28/2018,4,Delay at being called in but sometimes no delay. I don't moan re this cos I have the extra time when I need it. My doctor is brilliant. Text message is fun. Much improved since SWAN took over.
Forest,Much improved. Better altogether!,6/28/2018,5,"I always get to see the same doctor. More doctors, more nurses - much improved over the last few years. Better altogether!"
Forest,My current doctor is extremely good,8/29/2018,4,"A routine appointment with any doctor takes about 2 weeks, with a specific doctor that can go out to 4 weeks. I have had problems in the past but my current doctor is really good."
Forest,My current doctor is very good,3/1/2019,4,"This practice has settled down a bit of late but there was a time when doctors seemed to come and go. It seems more settled over the last couple of years and I have to say my current doctor is very, very good. I see him whenever I need an appointment. The nurses are very good as well and routine appointments are reasonably timely."
Forest,Never any issues,10/21/2022,5,I've never had a problem with my doctors practice. It's a good surgery with lovely staff.
Forest,Nice market town practice,3/12/2018,4,"I find this to be a nice little market town practice. Everything is on a human scale and the service is personal. I would like to see the same doctor every time but that isn't feasible so I will have to live with it. I'm happy with nurses and doctors, all in all it's a nice friendly place."
Forest,No help when found myself with Covid,7/12/2022,1,"It took 3 days to get sickness and pain relief.  Could not get anyone to come out for this. First ambulance crew spoke to surgery and help promised either by surgery staff or nurses. However, message not passed to nurses no pain/sickness relief arrived. Was advised to call second ambulance which gave me above and because condition has worsened took me in to Covid suite at West Suffolk."
Forest,No problem with appointments,8/29/2018,5,The practice pretty well meets all my needs. I don't have problem getting an appointment. As far as I am concerned there is nothing to really improve upon.
Forest,Normally all is ok,3/12/2018,4,This is in regard to my flu jab. The Saturday clinic 8-11 didn't work for us because I work Saturdays and I am the driver so I couldn't bring him. This is the third time of trying to get this sorted. Normally things are OK though.
Forest,Not much needs fixing,8/29/2018,4,The majority of times that I attend I am called in late but by acceptable amounts given the pressures. I  got an 'on the day' emergency appointment for today. Apart from being called in late I can't think of much that needs fixing here.
Forest,Nurses and doctors are now pretty good.,12/10/2018,5,"I think the practice is more accessible now, particularly in terms of appointments. My friends (that attend this practice) and I agree that the doctors and nurses are now pretty good. It could all do with a bit of a 'facelisf' though and I do generally have to wait a bit after my appointment time."
Forest,Nurses and doctors are very good,9/18/2018,4,"Getting a routine appointment can take a week or two. I am also usually late being called in (to doctors, nurses aren’t so bad) clinically I feel the doctors and nurses are very good. I would value a named regular doctor though. I am just over 20 minutes late being called in today but it has been up to an hour in the past."
Forest,Nurses are great,8/29/2018,4,I haven't been a patient here that long-months rather than years. Nurses are great but in my (limited) experience doctors less so.
Forest,Nurses are very good.,9/18/2018,5,"I got an appointment this morning for today, which is great. It takes up to three weeks for a routine appointment. with a specific GP though. It only takes a week to see a nurse. Privacy-I don’t like giving over personal information face to face with a receptionist when booking. Nurses are very good"
Forest,Often have to wait up to 3 weeks to see GP,11/14/2019,4,"Staff always helpful here, You do have to wait often up to 3 weeks to see the doctor you want to see."
Forest,Okay,2/3/2022,4,"The usual problems – can’t get an appointment. The real problem is the length of time you wait on the phone. You can wait in the queue for about 30 minutes before getting to speak to someone. The length wait is dependent on when you call – the 8am rush can be really bad. Once you’re there they’re all okay. The doctors and the phlebotomist are great. 
It’s just the options when you call. You get impatient after waiting so long and drive the 10 minutes to the surgery because you give up trying to call. When you get to the surgery they are sitting there waiting and you can get an appointment when you turn up but you’ve had to drive 20 minutes to do so. The website is useful for information, they have so much information on it, but making an appointment online just isn’t easy. They also lack continuity of care because you don’t see the same doctor when you go."
Forest,Overall fine with surgery,11/14/2019,4,Overall I am fine with this surgery and I don't feel I have to wait too long to get an appointment.
Forest,Polite staff,10/31/2022,5,"Fantastic surgery, was able to get a prompt appointment and I've had no issues on other occasions either. The staff are very polite and the flu clinic they ran here recently was very well organised and efficient and ran to time."
Forest,Poor communication,6/28/2018,2,Blood test: I was due a 3 monthly blood test and a blood pressure test. Nurse wouldn't do blood pressure test as it wasn't on her list. She also couldn't complete my methotrexate log. This was important.
Forest,Quite good once you get in,3/12/2018,5,"This practice is quite good (nurses and doctors) once you can get in. The staff attitude has improved steadily over the years. I booked an appointment (15th Nov) on 12th Oct! That was cancelled as doctor wasn't in and I am finally being seen today, 22nd November!"
Forest,Reception staff are great,8/29/2018,5,I feel much better looked after here than I did a few years ago. I can now get a (timely) appointment and the doctors seem better. The reception staff are great.
Forest,Receptionists are good,12/10/2018,4,The receptionists are good but the place badly needs redecorating. I've been coming here for 40 years and I have always been satisfactory for me. I see the same doctor on each visit which works well for me as he knows my ongoing condition. I would be very disappointed if that were to change. I do have to wait a bit for an appointment with him but that is because he is here two days a week and is very popular.
Forest,Shabby but doctors and nurses are good,7/5/2018,5,"I don't think it is dirty, more like shabby, hence 3 stars for cleanliness. Doctors and nurses are good and I seem to be able to get an appointment when I need one."
Forest,So good during my pregnancy,12/10/2018,5,They were all so good during my pregnancy. Care and support since my child has been born has also been exemplary. I haven't used the 'normal' GP service much outside of this but when I have needed to it all worked ok for me.
Forest,Some GP's are better than others,11/15/2019,4,"Some of the doctors are not as good as others at this surgery, one doctor said recently that my daughter had chicken pox but I knew that it wasn't and it wasn't. Apart from that on the whole I like this surgery.."
Forest,Staff are very good here,11/14/2019,5,"I am always quite happy with this surgery. Staff are very good here. You often do have to wait up to 45mins at appointment before you are called in. It is quite difficult if you want to ring the surgery, you can be holding on the phone often for 40mins before its answered."
Forest,Staff friendly and nice,12/2/2020,4,I like the booking in at the surgery is is easy with the check in screen. The staff seem to be friendly and nice. There can be a long wait on the phone to get through so I tend to come in and book my appointments face to face as I only live local. I would like to see more GP consistency if you want to see the same GP you have to wait a long time.
Forest,Staff have been amazing!,12/2/2020,5,"Since we transferred from another surgery in Norfolk we have found the staff to be amazing here, they are always helpful, also having the prescription office is really useful and helpful to us."
Forest,Staff were very caring,7/5/2018,4,I went up to have checkup last week. The staff were very caring. The doctor was very nice and he was gentle.
Forest,Text reminders are good,12/2/2020,4,"Text reminders are good for me, wish the dentist did them too. I saw there was a chat tab on the website and I started to use it the other day but I had to leave it as my daughter needed me, does the chat link connect directly with someone in this surgery? Staff are helpful in the surgery."
Forest,The Nurse Practitioner is fantastic !,11/15/2019,5,The nurse practitioner here is fantastic ! I am also very happy with my doctor too.
Forest,The system is clearly broken.,7/25/2022,1,"Soonest face to face appointment was 5 weeks.
Soonest blood test 2 weeks.
Econsult takes 1 week to answer.
Not able to pre book  appointments.
Have to ring on the day which means writing off days until can make an appointment.
Total waste of time."
Forest,They treat you as people here,11/14/2019,5,They treat you as people here. Sometimes they seem understaffed. Communication is good. I am impressed with the quality of GP's. I do think the surgery could do with a lick of paint.
Forest,This practice has got better,3/12/2018,4,This practice has got better and better over the last few years. Improvements have been made in pretty well all areas other than the decor of the waiting room which is now pretty shabby!
Forest,Told to contact GP surgery waited 45 mins,11/15/2021,1,Waited for 45 mins on phone after being told by the booking service 119 that they couldn’t find me a place with disabled access with toilet to have my booster. When I did eventually get through they hung up on me. I had spent over an hour I now give up stuff the booster.
Forest,Treatment is consistently good,9/18/2018,4,Treatment is consistently good but it is sometimes difficult to get an appointment. My doctor books me in (for return visits) but other routine appointments can take a little while.
Forest,Up to 45 min wait at appointment,12/2/2020,3,"It is variable but it can be a wait up to 45 mins on occasions at the appointment to be seen, which can be challenging, other than that no improvements needed."
Forest,Very caring,10/16/2017,5,I have always found them to be very caring and professional. I have absolutely no complaints with the service I receive but the doctors do come and go though!
Forest,Very good,10/31/2022,5,"Happy with the surgery, I'm not feeling great and there aren't any appointments this morning, so they have advised to call back after 11am when the afternoon appointments are released, so I'm going to do this. The staff were lovely and explained what to do and they are polite and helpful."
Forest,Very good,10/16/2017,4,The diabetes nurse calls on me as I need regular injections. The service is very good.
Forest,Very good now.,3/12/2018,4,I moved to Brandon about three years ago and at that time the practice seemed very disorganised but it is very good now. I make my appointments online which works well for me. I am very happy with the service I receive.
Forest,Very good surgery,4/11/2022,4,"It's a very good surgery but I've had to wait 5 weeks to see my preferred doctor, but they are very good and therefore the waits are understandable for non-urgent issues. The cost of getting a taxi to have blood tests at West Suffolk hospital or Newmarket are high and it would be better if more blood tests could be done at the surgery."
Forest,Very good surgery,10/31/2022,5,It's a very good surgery. I called this morning and was offered a phone or face-to-face appointment and I like that I can choose. I've had a face-to-face appointment and all the medication issues I was having have been sorted out quickly. Staff are great and so supportive.
Forest,Very helpful staff,4/11/2022,4,"I'm new to the area and have found the staff at the surgery very helpful with any queries or questions I've had. It's a shame that blood tests have to be done so far away from the surgery, apart from the time it takes for regular appointments there is also the cost of travelling to West Suffolk hospital or Mildenhall.  I've just seen an amazing doctor, they explained everything very well, really impressed."
Forest,Very much improved over the years,12/10/2018,5,I moved to Brandon and registered here ten years ago or just over. It is very much improved over the years I have been coming. Doctors explain things very well without me having to ask which is good and blood tests are on site which I find works very well for me.
Forest,Very satisfied and clinicians are very good,6/28/2018,5,Clinicians are very good. I see different doctors / nurses on different occasions but I've always been very satisfied. There are 'niggles' with appointment / being called in on time but they are minor in comparison.
Forest,Very supportive and helpful advice.,2/19/2020,5,I had to speak with the prescriptions office to make some changes. (Name removed) was very supportive and gave me good information. She ensured I understood and confirmed my preferences. I find telephone conversations difficult and she made it much easier by letting me take my time and reassuring me. Her approach to me made what is an anxious task for me to do much less daunting. Thank you
Forest,Wait up to 3 weeks to get an appointment,11/14/2019,3,"It is difficult to get a GP appointment, up to 3 weeks. I don't have to wait long for blood tests but you do have to wait longer to see the GP. It would be beneficial for the pop up surgery at Mundford to be more regular as it costs me to get a community car into Brandon."
Forest,Waited 2 weeks for appointment - not good!,7/5/2018,4,Sometimes receptionists can be a bit abrupt. I had to wait two weeks for this appointment - that's not good.
Forest,Waiting too long on the phone,11/15/2019,4,"I've always got on well with the nurses and doctors at this surgery. Sometimes I can have to wait up to 40 mins before the phone is answered even when the message says that I am number 1 in the queue, I do wish that was better."
Forest,We both feel very well looked after,3/1/2019,5,My Mum's doctor works two days a week here and we always try to book with him on one of those days and it works very well for us. If mum needs a follow up appointment the doctor books it there and then while she in the first consultation. We both feel very well looked after here.
Framfield,1-2 week wait for an appointment,10/31/2019,4,Got appointment today which surprised me.  Most of the time it is a 1-2 week wait
Framfield,25 minutes late and counting,4/26/2018,4,"Staff can be quite short with you. My appointment today is currently 25 minutes late. No information is given to you to tell you this when you arrive, and because staff are quite unhappy looking, you do not dare ask."
Framfield,Able to get an appointment when needed.,2/21/2017,5,Usually can get an appointment when I need one
Framfield,Advanced appointment problems,6/10/2015,3,"Although my doctor needed to see me in 3 weeks time, I wasn't allowed to book that far forward.  They wanted me to wait until the day and phone from 8am and then hope an appointment would be available on the day. Disappointing."
Framfield,All staff are welcoming,6/1/2017,5,All the staff are welcoming and it is great when you can get there-but appointment system is difficult
Framfield,All the staff are fine,7/10/2015,5,All the staff are fine
Framfield,Always a good service,2/21/2017,5,Always had good service when I need them
Framfield,Always a positive experience,10/29/2019,5,Always a positive experience - no complaints at all
Framfield,Always able to see a nurse immediately.,2/21/2017,4,Have asthma.  Am able to see nurse immediately I request.  Have a new doctor who is very efficient
Framfield,Appointment system frustrating,9/11/2018,4,Once all appointments are gone they say you have to call again the next day at 8.30am.  When you do that you cannot get through most of the time. It is very frustrating.
Framfield,Appointments run late,12/11/2019,4,Most of the time appointments are 1-2 weeks away.  Appointments run late.  Today they are 10-15 mins.  It is good though that the TV screens are used to communicate that.
Framfield,Approachable and efficient,4/24/2023,5,"They are approachable and efficient, its well managed and throughout covid they did very well and coped with appointments well. The nurse practitioners are brilliant. I do realise that it is a challenging role working in a GP surgery."
Framfield,Bad communication as no continuity,5/8/2016,5,"There are many GP's that work at the surgery, however it makes sharing information difficult as 4 GP's work 4 days (considered full-time) 75% of them are female and another 4 GP's work 2 days, 75% of them are female. It prevents good continuity and also makes things difficult if you prefer to see a Male GP as the appointments for them are really limited."
Framfield,Bad coordination and communication,4/26/2018,3,"I feel that having tests done all at the same time would be better. I had bloods done a week after giving a specimen, which is now back.
Reception who give you results do not seem to have good communication with the GP's, as I rang in for my results and was told the GP would call me back, however by 5pm on that day I still had had no call. So I called them. Initially I was told it was 'borderline', then later on I was told it was 'negative'.  Today I came in for another blood test and I was then told the GP needs to see me but could not until later today, so I have to go home and then come back again later! I am not sure they realise how stressful that makes me, and prolongs the worry."
Framfield,Better signs needed,9/22/2016,4,"New to the surgery & found it difficult to know how this surgery worked.  When asked where was I,e, room 14 .  Then found 2nd floor. Better signage or directions from staff would have helped as I was unfamiliar with the surgery layout, process etc"
Framfield,Blood tests,6/3/2019,3,"When I have rang to book an appointment for a blood test, they have said on a few occasions that it would be preferable if I went to Ipswich Hospital for blood tests.  Do not think that is right."
Framfield,Blood tests at surgery,12/20/2018,3,"My father kept being sent for blood tests at the 'Warfarin clinic' at the hospital, when the surgery does tests at the surgery.  He is very elderly and so not very mobile, so getting to the hospital is logistically much more difficult and involves him needing someone to take him.  The hospital told him, that if the surgery requests the test, they then must do it. Since then, armed with this information my father gets his tests at the surgery, which is much more convenient for him."
Framfield,Called 12 times,2/13/2019,4,"After 12 times of calling and line was engaged every time today, but I eventually got through and got an appointment.  This is the norm, and it is frustrating."
Framfield,called to ask about smear result as not heard,3/5/2018,5,"Receptionist listened to my concern re not hearing about smear result, was polite and helpful and respectful when asking if she could ask a colleague who deals with smears - came back to me in a few minutes with update .
Could not have been more pleased or impresed with her response to my call"
Framfield,Can only give high praise for the service,5/8/2016,5,"Everyone here is so kind and helpful. It goes a long way these days and costs nothing, so I personally can only give high praise to this surgery"
Framfield,Cannot fault the service,4/22/2016,5,We use the surgery regularly as we have a few health needs. We are very happy with the treatment and courtesy we receive. We find getting an appointment no issue though we have to accept we cannot always see our own GP.
Framfield,Cannot get through,7/12/2018,3,Phone just rings and rings or you can't get through. I needed to see someone in two weeks and got told I have to call on the day. Just do not like this system. Never get to see the same person.
Framfield,Cannot praise them enough.,4/22/2016,5,Everything is good here in my experience. I have my repeat prescription check up and whenever I need to go and see a GP I have no problems. I do not need the service as much as some though.
Framfield,Consistently good over the years,1/24/2019,4,"I have been under this practice for many years.  It has been excellent over that time.  Particular vigilance has been given in my referrals for scans where cancer was diagnosed.  However, recently my GP said he needed me to come back in a week after starting some new medication, but he said he would not be around so gave me another doctors name and a letter to then give to reception.  The reception team said that 'due to allocation' or 'held back' appointments they could not make the appointment.  I asked to see the Practice Manager, and they thankfully sorted it out.
It was just a bit stressful, and quite unnecessary, as it is not my problem.  They should all know the system, and if the PM could sort it, then surely this means the system can be bypassed when a GP has asked for this to happen. I was made to feel 'in the middle' of this which felt like a dispute between the GP and Reception team, and did come over as rather unprofessional."
Framfield,Coordinated blood tests,9/27/2018,4,"I do not come very often to see the GP, and I am here today for a blood test that I have regularly for Warfarin medication.  These are always coordinated really well."
Framfield,Difficult getting appointment,4/26/2018,4,"I am quite happy to see a nurse because if a doctor is needed they do generally get one in. It is just difficult to get an appointment even with the nurse, let alone a GP"
Framfield,Difficult to get through,9/27/2018,4,"It is difficult to get through on the day you need someone to see you. Have to keep trying a few days on the trot. My GP however was not available, so having to see someone who I have not seen before and don't know my long term conditions. My appointment time is 25 minutes late today. No communication about why."
Framfield,difficulty with appointments,6/14/2016,3,difficult to get an appointment
Framfield,Dirty facilities,1/24/2019,3,"The service itself is average but I would like them to realise the dirtiness of the toilets for a NHS place they should be pristine, and they really are not.

I used the toilet here and it is rather dirty (downstairs one)  The wall under the hand fan is yellow.  The floor is really really dirty in colour.  The toilet roll holder is below the fan and has no cover on it, so when you put wet hands under the fan you drip on the loo roll! If I was not so desperate I would have walked out.  It looks like a new building and modern, but the cleanliness does not measure up to that at all.  This was at 10 am so I am doubting it had been cleaned that day."
Framfield,Doctors don't seem to care,5/18/2015,2,The nurses and HCAs are wonderful but most of the doctors I have seen in the last few years couldn't care. To get rid of the signs and symptoms of throat cancer (which is in my family) I was told to quit smoking and having collapsed four times with chest pains and breathlessness I was told to cut down on coffee.
Framfield,Dr made me feel like I was wasting their time,6/7/2018,3,I called reception to ask for a telephone consultation as I wanted to review medications for a stomach complaint. The receptionist said that I needed to see a Dr. because it was stomach related and they would need to examine me. I arrived for my appointment and the Dr. made me feel like I had wasted their time and that I shouldn't be there. I did explain that I had only wanted to talk on the phone to save everyones time but they were rude and dismissive.
Framfield,Easy to access,1/24/2019,4,"We know others have issues getting appointments, but we do not.  You just have to be prepared to hit 'redial' and eventually you will get through.  It is to be expected.  They are friendly and we have not had any issues."
Framfield,Emergency illnesss,1/30/2023,5,"I have been registered with Framfield House Surgery sincee the late 1970s and the care we have received has always been very good. In December 2022 I was unwell on two occasions. On the second occasion I was seen as a face to face emergency with chest pain and breathlessness and after a check up and ECG it was thought I might be suffering a heart attack and was despatched to Ipswich Hospital where I spent 10 days on the cardiac ward. Fortunately, I did not suffer a heart attack but blood clots were found in my lungs. 
Since discharge I have attended the surgery on average twice a week, either to see a doctor or have blood tests and also telephone consultations . The care provided by 2 Doctors and the nursing staff has been exceptional . The receptionists have always been welcoming and friendly and fitted me in for urgent blood tests, sometimes at short notice.
I commend this surgery and their staff for their caring and professionalism."
Framfield,excellent,9/14/2017,5,It's a great surgery but I never get to see my own GP.  Seeing the nurse is great and appointments aren't so difficult to get.  If I wanted to see my GP I'd have to wait a while as they only work part-time
Framfield,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Waiting time to get appointment can be up to 3 weeks but surgery runs on time
Framfield,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Difficult to book appointments if not urgent
Framfield,excellent,9/14/2017,5,A priviledge to be a patient in such a surgery.  Grateful to have the service
Framfield,excellent,9/14/2017,5,We have found Framfield House satisfactory over a number of years
Framfield,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Very good
Framfield,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Since being placed with my new doctor and conducting a telephone assessment I have received extremely prompt attention/appointments. Friends complain of long waiting times.
Framfield,Excellent but not enough parking places,2/21/2017,5,Not enough parking places
Framfield,Excellent medical team,6/9/2016,5,Physios are very good and are supported by an excellent medical team
Framfield,Excellent service,12/10/2022,5,"This is an excellent service for my whole family. Always get to see my GP face to face on a consistent basis. I rang one day at 6:15pm and they still saw us 5 minutes later, as were able to get there quickly. Today I rang and offered a phone call or face to face and I chose to come in, so it was nice to have the choice. They are great with the kids."
Framfield,Excellent service,10/29/2019,4,"Overall excellent  service.  We get appointments within a reasonable amount of time and see nurses more often than GPs, but find this has been appropriate thus far"
Framfield,Excellent service and staff are professional.,6/5/2020,5,I have a genetic kidney condition and the staff always get me an appointment with a relevant medical professional.
Framfield,Excellent service for the last 12 years,2/21/2017,5,Have had excellent service for the last 12 years in spite of all the NHS changes/ shortage of staff etc. It has not impacted on the care
Framfield,Fair - but long wait to see Consultant,1/11/2016,3,"I was referred to the practice to have an ECG and see a consultant.  We were advised a arrive a bit early which we did.  I then had the ECG quite quickly.  We then waited 4 hours to be seen by the consultant.  There was no explanation from staff and if they had said it was going to be that long we could've gone and got something to drink.  When we did see the consultant he was very good.  The people were great, it was just the wait"
Framfield,Fair but too long a wait to see GP,2/21/2017,3,Nurse said I need to see doctor about incontinence after seeing them (Nurse)  but they (Doctor) are booked for a whole month.  Told to call at 8 am on Wednesday but I never get through.
Framfield,Feel lucky,1/24/2019,5,This is a great practice as far as we are concerned. Always able to get an appointment when we need one. The nursing staff are particularly caring.  We feel very lucky.
Framfield,Friendly staff but can be tricky to book an appt.,4/13/2015,3,"Online appointments appear to be only available for about two weeks ahead. Not releasing afternoon appointments until 11.30am can make it awkward, as then have to be able to phone at 11.30am during the working day. Would welcome more early evening/weekend appointments, outside of school hours."
Framfield,Front desk staff rude,12/11/2019,3,"Find front desk staff can be rude.  Walked in and queried something.  Language used was argumentative.  Questioned why they would use such a terms as 'thrash it out', they said they were just making conversation.  I was told they were not taking patients from other surgeries and I needed a prescription urgently which would mean registering here, getting a GP appointment and then signature for prescription.  I was turned away."
Framfield,Frustrating with long term condition,12/3/2019,4,The surgery request blood tests when I have the annual diabetic check but I may have only just had a test with the hospital where they manage my condition. Although its a long term condition I can only get 1 months supply of the tablets which I've been on for years. Its so frustrating to have to reorder each month when nothing is going to change. My condition is more complicated so coming in to the surgery to discuss things with staff when they can't add anything seems a waste of time for both them and me. For general appointments however the surgery is generally good but for my long term condition it can be frustrating.
Framfield,Generally very helpful,12/11/2019,4,I find the surgery generally very helpful.  Having only been in the area for 2 years they are far better than my previous experiences with the NHS
Framfield,good,10/10/2016,4,Doctors and nurses are great but reception can be obstructive.  You feel that they don't want to help.  Poorly organised.
Framfield,Good,7/3/2019,4,I called recently to see my GP and was told I could have an appointment in 3 weeks time
Framfield,good,7/3/2019,4,never seem to see the same GP more than once
Framfield,good,7/3/2019,4,I am deaf and find the answering machine difficult  to operate - questions & answers - pressing numbers. It would be nice to hear a human voice!
Framfield,good,7/3/2019,4,Sometimes it is better than other time
Framfield,good,7/3/2019,4,The surgery is far too busy. There isn't time to discuss problems! If only there was more time.
Framfield,Good,1/19/2016,4,When needing appointment I prefer to make it face to face
Framfield,Good service at the Foot Clinic.,2/21/2017,5,"Good service  (Foot clinic)  2 - 3 months for first appointment.  NOT diabetic, has spinal problem"
Framfield,Good standard of treatment,9/11/2018,4,Most of the time I get an appointment and the GP I see is very good. My treatment here is a good standard and I have needed other services whereby my GP refers me immediately.
Framfield,Good surgery overall,9/27/2018,5,"Things seemed to have got better in being able to get an appointment on the day.  I am aware they filter patients a little bit now.
It is convenient to have on site blood tests and Physio, which I have used and as it is local it is much better, especially as the parking is free"
Framfield,Good to access multiple services,7/12/2018,5,Surgery has many services operating out of it and I have used some of them whilst unwell with my heart. It is good to be able to go there instead of the longer trip to the hospital.
Framfield,GP does not listen or explain things,6/1/2017,3,My GP does not have time to listen to me or explain things. Suggested I Google my condition on web
Framfield,GP excellent and easy to talk to,10/31/2019,5,Find my GP excellent and easy to talk to.  I have received referrals when needed.  Appointments run 10-15 mins late mostly.
Framfield,GP willing to listen and allows me time,6/22/2016,4,"Having been bereaved I then lost a lot of weight, the GP's have allowed me time, they've been supportive and kind."
Framfield,Great Service,4/25/2019,5,I have always been able to get appointments when needed and booking regular blood tests.
Framfield,Hard to get appointment but good care,2/21/2017,4,Difficult to get an appointment but it is good to have a central place where there is diabetes care and physio in one place
Framfield,Hard to get through,9/27/2018,4,"Generally good.  Hard to get through at 8am and then appointments are gone.
As I work I prefer an early or late appointment, which is even harder to come by.  I didn't know about GP+ and have never been offered it, but now I do I will ask next time if I can there."
Framfield,Hard to get through at 8am,1/24/2019,4,"Find the booking system difficult to get through on at the busy time of 8am. However, if you leave it later, all appointments are gone and you get told to ring at 8am again. I recently saw a member of staff who I found to be somewhat patronising and dismissive compared to many I saw previously at Wickham Market MC."
Framfield,Hard to use eye droppers and getting appointments,2/21/2017,1,Prescription.  When picking up eye prescription they changed them and they are small and really hard to squeeze out as my hands are limited in movement.  Pharmacist said I need to go back to GP.  But very difficult to get appointment!
Framfield,helpfulness variable & appt system unhelpful,4/17/2015,3,"When trying to make an appt. some reception staff are helpful and others can be short and less helpful, sometimes you see a doctor who explains things kindly and other times they can be short too."
Framfield,I can always get an appointment,9/27/2018,5,"Always can get an appointment when I call at 8am.
Husband see's the diabetic specialist here too and they are good.  New meter change though has been difficult. The timing is not working well for us going on holiday, as the strips will not be ready in time for us to pick up before we leave. The old meter strips do not fit the new meters.  We are going to have to take the old meter away with us."
Framfield,I can get an appointment easily,12/11/2019,4,I can get an appointment quite easily.  My daughter and children who get persistently ill do tend to see a nurse all of the time.  With persistent illness in children I do feel seeing a GP after a couple of nurse visits would be appropriate
Framfield,It still feels personal,9/26/2018,5,"All the doctors I have seen here have been very, very good. It is a big practice now but it still feels like a personal service"
Framfield,Lack of access,9/14/2018,2,"I have struggled to get appointments after birth of my child and had post natal depression, and felt like they talked down to me. They made me feel worse when I left instead of better.  There are a couple of GP's that I refuse to see now."
Framfield,Lack of care,1/24/2019,3,"Feel that there is just lack of care here. The system makes everything difficult and when you finally see someone there is no person-centered feel at all.
I feel the question 'is it an emergency' quite ridiculous.  A & E is for emergencies.  It makes you feel bad about needing help for an illness. It would actually mean that you never ask for an appointment.  It just feels all wrong."
Framfield,Language barrier,1/24/2019,4,"We find the surgery good as English is not our first language.  We have not used language line as yet, I support my partner if needed at appointments. So far it has not been an issue."
Framfield,Long wait to see GP,5/8/2016,4,"When you turn up for an appointment that is booked, there often is a long wait. No information is given about how long you will be waiting for so you can not take some fresh air or use the toilet. I have often waited 60-80 minutes. Just wish they would let you know."
Framfield,Lost confidence in the GP's,1/30/2018,3,"Do not feel listened to and GP looks at watch and says I have to leave. Two particular occasions where I have had concerns about some horrible symptoms, when it was not what they thought it should be in their mind after blood tests they said to just get in with it. I still have no answers. Not thorough and give me no confidence."
Framfield,More details were needed,8/1/2019,3,More details at appointments regarding pregnancy and after-care was needed.
Framfield,"My doctor is attentive, a good listener",9/16/2015,5,"Thankful that my doctor at Framfield surgery is willing to listen to me and offer support, especially since my daughter died."
Framfield,Need to communicate better,12/10/2022,4,"I am struggling with a few things and really need answers. 
No one tells you enough. For example: After a CT scan 2 weeks ago I have heard nothing. I don't know if the surgery tells me the results or if I have to wait on the hospital, no one told me. The hospital said '10 days', for results, so it is overdue and in the meantime I am left worrying about it."
Framfield,No complaints,10/22/2019,5,I cannot complain of anything here as in my experience I have been treated well and do not have to wait long for appointment
Framfield,No longer syringe ears,1/24/2019,3,"I am here today to see The Hearing Care centre, and having to pay. This surgery used to do it for me, but no longer does and I am unsure how much longer I can afford to pay for it.  They have not spoken to me about how I can prevent the problem, but I will ask today."
Framfield,"Not easy to get an appointment, staff need to understanding",2/21/2017,4,Not easy to get an appointment.  I feel staff need to be more understanding.  If they are rude it makes you annoyed; if they were more understanding they would get same back from patients
Framfield,Not the best,10/8/2016,2,"The building gives you the impression that it is a lovely surgery, and it is very clean, however I find the 'human' touch is not there. It is hard to get an appointment and you are made to feel like you are a bother for wanting one. I do sometimes wonder if they are trying to make you feel that way so you do not bother trying in the future."
Framfield,Not very understanding,3/27/2015,2,"Phoned the practice to talk about an experience with a GP. The member of staff I spoke to was very blunt, quick to pass judgement and not very understanding at all."
Framfield,"Nothing is wrong, happy with the service",7/16/2015,3,"Nothing is wrong, happy with the service"
Framfield,Often need more than 10 minutes,10/17/2016,3,8 am calling does not work for me.  Often need more than the 10 minutes with my doctor as I have ongoing issues
Framfield,On the day appointment made easily,9/27/2018,5,"I was happy to see any GP today, so access for an 'on the day appointment' was easy.  My regular blood test appointments are made easily.  On one occasion when I was making appointment for my next test with reception, the Phlebotomist was standing nearby and said I can go in and have one right now if I'd like to. So I did.  Excellent overall"
Framfield,Organised appointment system,2/21/2017,5,Have a regular appointment.  It happens automatically - no waiting for me.
Framfield,Poor continuity of care,9/11/2015,3,"Following dental surgery in the day clinic at Ipswich Hospital I got a dry socket infection and had to go back to the outpatients department later on that week. I was given antibiotics. I had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics, my head started to swell. I visited my GP who gave me steroids and antihistamines but wouldn't talk to me about the antibiotics. I had to go back to the hospital to resolve that issue. I felt like I was going backwards and forwards."
Framfield,Prescribing nurses 'A God send!',5/8/2016,4,"Very, very difficult to get to see a GP, especially your own. I am grateful that nurses are now doing some prescribing otherwise where would we be?"
Framfield,problem with Appointments,6/14/2016,1,can never get an appointment
Framfield,Quicker appointments,4/8/2015,4,Frustrating not to be able to get quicker appointments but understand why. More patients than most people! Sometimes have to wait up to 10 days for non urgent appointment.
Framfield,Referral issue,6/10/2015,4,Would have been helpful if my GP had referred me to the surgeries mental health link worker 6 months sooner.
Framfield,Rude staff,1/30/2018,3,"I have stopped seeing on GP as felt they didn't listen, I now see another one but find it the same experience. The GP's are quite rude and so are most of the frontline staff. Why? I do not know."
Framfield,Running late today,9/27/2018,4,"My appointment time was 15 minutes ago, so running a bit late today.  I called this morning and got an appointment so that is pretty good. I do not use the surgery very much though."
Framfield,Satisfactory.,8/4/2016,3,"I was unable to get a GP appointment for 10 days or so and instead saw the nurse who ordered a blood test which proved clear. My complaint continued but could not get a GP appointment. Phoning several times day and waiting for a cancellation. Not a problem for me, being retired, but unsatisfactory for those who are employed. Why not have one doctor a day holding an evening surgery without the need for an appointment or at least an appointment on the day."
Framfield,Second to none care and friendly service,1/21/2020,5,"Currently I am attending surgery approx weekly mainly for blood tests and results etc, care and experience could not be better, thanks one and all"
Framfield,Staff are friendly and welcoming,12/1/2017,5,Staff friendly and welcoming.  However used some terms I was not familiar with.
Framfield,Telephone appointments not popular,5/8/2016,5,The surgery is getting much busier. My friends and I do not like the telephone appointment system idea. You no longer get regular check-up as before as you now have to 'opt in' which people are not told until you realise it has been a while since you had one.
Framfield,The surgery doors aren't disabled user friendly,4/13/2015,2,"Using a standing frame able to press a button to open outer surgery doors but then can't get through the inner doors which are push/pull, left stuck in between the two sets of doors, could be the same for others for example if using a wheelchair."
Framfield,Took up two appointments,9/27/2018,4,"Seeing my own GP can be difficult. I was desperate to see them recently, but had to see another as mine was busy at short notice.  The GP I saw proceeded to write notes for the attention of my GP and told me I'd have to make another appointment to see them.  So ended up using double the time."
Framfield,Ulcer clinic,9/23/2022,4,"Supporting my elderly mother after a fall. They saw her 2 times a week over about 4 weeks. I took photo's in so they could see the difference in her leg. Finally, they referred her to the leg ulcer clinic which operates in Framfield house.
I never knew this service existed. Felt they should have done this sooner as mum had a lot of pain. Seeing a different person every time did not help."
Framfield,Unable to see own doctor.,2/21/2017,3,I would like to be able to see my own doctor
Framfield,Varied service,10/31/2019,3,"Things have varied depending on who I have seen.  I find when I am poorly they are excellent, but leading up to 'very poorly' they are not so good.  I try to prevent getting 'very poorly' but alas you get nothing until you are in that state."
Framfield,Very good,3/16/2016,4,It is very good.  If need an appointment you can get one
Framfield,"Visited GP, friendly staff and helpful info",10/25/2016,4,"Helpful response when I rang for an appointment from Receptionist on phone and then at desk. GP listened and gave good guidance, explained my options."
Framfield,Waiting to see GP on their request,9/27/2018,4,"I cannot see the GP who has asked to see me about blood tests, until 2 weeks time. Only 1 appointment was available next week, but I am not free and so it is another week until next one.
Staff are quite defensive about the situation."
Framfield,Walk in to get appointment,1/24/2019,3,The receptionists here are quite rude.  I only get an appointment if I walk-in at 8am.  I fell the way the surgery is run as a business is not a way to run a business.  It needs seriously looking at.  Staff that care and are happy would be a good start!
Framfield,Walk-in to get appointment,1/24/2019,3,"The appointment system here means I just walk-in at 8 am rather than try ringing as it is always engaged and I just do not have time to keep hitting 're-dial'.
Feel 'holding system' would be better than just 'engaged'.  At least then you would be on a system, can put it on speaker and get on with something whilst waiting to get through."
Framfield,Works for me!,4/22/2016,4,"I know it does not suit everyone, but personally I find the Doctor's phone back service very prompt and means you do not take up full appointments if it is easy to diagnose and prescribe on the telephone."
Framfield,Works well for me,10/29/2019,4,"Things for me work well.  I do not come very often, however the last few months I have been 3 or 4 times and I get to see a regular GP which assures me and I feel comfortable with that."
Framfield,You can't always see your own dr on the day,9/12/2016,5,"No moans or groans about surgery.  You can't always see your own doctor on the day (days off, holidays or full up) but you always get an appointment on the day.  We have 3 nurse practitioners who will always see you"
Framlingham,7 people in front of me.,2/27/2019,3,Have been in and there were 7 people in front of me when I am on time.  Can be a bit difficult as i struggle with my mental health.
Framlingham,A bit dated,9/14/2018,4,"Been here all my life and the surgery is very good.  A suggestion for improvement would be - please make the car parking spaces wider. I found it particularly difficult with a baby opening the door to get my child seat out.  Whilst the work is being done to the expansion, perhaps this could be looked at, at the same time.  The surgery itself feels like it needs a 'freshen up'. Carpet is particularly dated.

I have waited up to an hour at appointments and there was no communication about why this was the case.  I asked reception and they said that they had an emergency come in, which is fine, just wish they'd told us as I was getting annoyed sitting and not knowing."
Framlingham,A very good surgery,1/29/2018,4,We will need to expand however with all the new houses going up.
Framlingham,Abhorrent,3/8/2021,1,"Invisible GPs. When you ring for appointment the arrogance of reception staff is breathtaking, obviously instructed to do everything on their power to prevent the GP ever having to talk with, let alone meet a patient regardless of their symptoms. Argumentative, rude, non caring, patronising. These are just some of the terms that accurately describe the reception staff and practice manager."
Framlingham,Access quick and efficiently done,2/27/2019,5,Excellent access at surgery.  We had a letter for our baby to attend and see the GP and they tied it in with the need for immunisation with the nurse.  So it has saved us doing 2 trips. Well coordinated.
Framlingham,Adapting well,2/25/2019,4,"Under the circumstances the surgery is adapting what they offer very well.  The 'drop-off' area is appreciated, but it means you need someone capable of walking further to bring you to the surgery, which I have had an issue with in the past."
Framlingham,Advanced and same day appointments available,3/15/2016,5,More recently I've noticed that it has become difficult to get an appointment when I need one. I generally see who ever is available and they are all good. Normally you can book 3-4 days in advance but if you need an appointment on the day you can usually get one if you ring in the morning.
Framlingham,Always get an appointment,9/14/2018,5,"I can always get an appointment. It is good that the building work has started so quickly, as the population is expanding"
Framlingham,Appalling service in my experience,6/16/2023,1,"My experience here over the years and more so lately has been that it is appalling. They didn't do a check on my partner who later died when things were found later down the line that would have showed up on the check.
It has left me feeling I can trust no one here. I wrote to the GP's and no one sent any letter back to me. I have no choice but to be under this practice, as it is the only choice we have. I would move if I could."
Framlingham,Appointment today,6/19/2023,4,"Today felt a bit 'too good to be true.' Went in to get medication and asked if possible to have a telephone appointment for a GP, but I was told that I can come back in an hour to see someone. I assume it is a GP...."
Framlingham,Appointment today,8/13/2021,3,"I rang in today, had a call back and then offered an appointment, all on the same day. This I think is very good.  My issue is the system used to call them.  It just rings and rings, you just do not know how long it will be before someone picks it up. Most surgeries have a holding system so you know where you are in the queue. Do feel they need to get this sorted, then if you are still way off from being answered you can decide how long you have to wait to be answered."
Framlingham,Been consistently good for us,2/25/2019,4,This has been consistently good for a long time for me and my family. It can be difficult to access sometimes as the 'phones are busy at 8 am.  If it is a day I am working it is difficult to call at that time.  More online access for appointments makes sense to me.
Framlingham,Blood test today,2/27/2019,4,"In for a blood test and it all went well.  Coordinated well and appointment made for it easily.  The surgery is good for any usual illness needs.  Access appointments ok, however my only negative thing to say is that things can run behind"
Framlingham,Brilliant and helpful,2/27/2019,4,Always a brilliant and helpful surgery.  I appreciate wait times are long and dependent on so many factors. Maybe communicating it would be good for patients who need to know the timescales.
Framlingham,called for appointment,8/17/2021,4,"I have a GP appointment today after they called me 2 weeks ago, though that is a while with little info shared, I do find that it is working ok for me. I am also able to pick up my prescription on the same site, so that is good and convenient."
Framlingham,Cannot ask for more,8/17/2021,5,"I have used the online form a couple of times recently and this resulted in a call that day which resolved my issue both times. These were low level issues, so it was appropriate. If I had something more complex I would wish to see someone face to face."
Framlingham,Cannot fault the service,2/25/2019,5,"I cannot fault this service.  Nurses/GP's are all attentive and caring.  Reception staff can be a little short on the telephone, but I understand it as they are under a lot of pressure particularly first thing in morning."
Framlingham,Can't book to see specific person,6/19/2023,3,"'On the day' extremely good and 5* - helping me a lot with ongoing blood pressure issues. However, booking to see someone specific is very difficult. When you have been asked to do that too, it's frustrating. My situation was that I started new medication and needed a review before they finished so I needed to time it and see the same GP who said 'book in again with me in ....weeks when appointments are released.' I rang up when suggested, but had not been released yet, and they said I would need to contact them again on the day it was released. I was advised to go into the surgery and not ring in as 'otherwise it will be gone.' I turned up at 8am and was told there was nothing. I relayed back what had previously been said to me and they miraculously said 'oh yes, can see that slot,' and they booked it for me.  Such a palaver though!"
Framlingham,Cant complain,6/22/2017,5,I cannot complain about my doctor's surgery
Framlingham,Care by Physio therapist,4/28/2015,5,Care by physiotherapist at Framlingham surgery has been very good.
Framlingham,Communication between MH services,1/29/2018,5,"Occasionally there is poor communication between Stowmarket Suffolk Mental Health (IDT), but that is probably to do with them. Unfortunately medications disagreement with Mental Health leading to Framlingham not willing to prescribe"
Framlingham,Communication issues. But care very good,4/22/2016,4,Communication between the surgery and the hospital staff could be better and then again within the hospital.
Framlingham,Could have had forsight,2/27/2019,4,"I feel they should have had the foresight to arrange a separate parking area nearby for patients, in order to alleviate the nearby streets where many park making local people annoyed as their driveways are a lot harder to access and the street is much more difficult to drive down, making it more dangerous to cross too.  As there is land nearby, I think the surgery could have come to some arrangement in order to help with this."
Framlingham,Desperate for help after being ignored,9/11/2021,1,"Awful response to mental health, GPs have no empathy. Given a prescription for a drug I already take, no investigation, just fobbed off continually."
Framlingham,Diabetes check,6/24/2022,3,I used to go 3-monthly for my diabetes check. At least a year ago since my last check now.  I have heard nothing from them.
Framlingham,Difficult to call when you work,2/27/2019,3,"Difficult to book appointments as only appointment on the day from 8 am. I start work at 7.45 am so calling 8-8.30 am not always possible and then when I do get through appointment all taken! A wee to see a Dr is too long to wait.  The could have a cancellation list with callback, as not even a triage call is available, but it is commonly used at other surgeries."
Framlingham,Doesn't feel as community friendly,4/29/2015,2,"The surgery doesn't feel as community friendly and welcoming as it used to be. Sad to be losing our practise nurse, we'll miss her caring approach in the clinics she held."
Framlingham,Don't like the way the surgery is set out,12/17/2015,3,"When having an appointment with doctor,  I mentioned about going to check on my husband who had a fall and they said ""if we did that we'd never be here"". I also do not like the way the surgery is set out as you walk in the door and everyone is looking at you."
Framlingham,Earl Soham is a good surgery,1/22/2016,5,"A good surgery, been a patient for years"
Framlingham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Feel very lucky, good doctors, carers."
Framlingham,Excellent,3/16/2016,5,"Always kind and caring staff , doctors, nurses and receptionists"
Framlingham,excellent,1/19/2016,5,"At times the office staff ask questions in public, eg. why do you need a double apt?  WHAT IS IT FOR?  
Not very keen on the new position of screen in waiting room"
Framlingham,Excellent and very easy getting an appointment,3/10/2017,5,The ease of getting an urgent appointment when needed is great.. Generally a very good surgery and works well
Framlingham,Excellent but hard to get appointment,3/20/2017,5,Difficult to get an appointment already .  With more houses going up it is only going to get worse.  Unlikely to recommend due to the surgery being so busy
Framlingham,Excellent but hard to see GP,3/20/2017,5,I only see the nurse/ physio - not GP. Seeing a GP is hard but other services are easy to access when you need them
Framlingham,Excellent but long waits for appointments,3/20/2017,5,Long wait for appointment here
Framlingham,Excellent but worried about future capacity,3/20/2017,5,Worried about the next few years..  New houses in the area and no indication of surgery expansion
Framlingham,Excellent GP's,2/27/2019,5,"Cleanliness would be higher rated, but with the building work going on at moment things are not as good.  Experience of Dr * and Dr * especially good, they are excellent GP's.  Can usually get appointment when needed.  Very happy with this practice."
Framlingham,Excellent service for me,9/23/2022,5,"This is an excellent service for me. Really responsive to my needs. When I got Covid I was experiencing asthma style attacks, but never had asthma before. In response to a phone call appointment they were confident to prescribe me inhalers, which did resolve it. They are also on top of my meds for my mental health too, I cannot fault them"
Framlingham,Excellent treatment,9/23/2022,4,"Regular blood tests given on time. We see a GP, but unfortunately not always the same one. We understand the pressures and thing they do well under them"
Framlingham,Extremely patient,2/27/2019,5,Dr was extremely patient and thorough as he had never see me before.  Listened carefully to what I said and seemed to care.  Concern with this is that it takes longer than your allocated 10 minutes so can put the surgery behind on time.
Framlingham,Fair,6/21/2016,3,Generally good communication and service.  At times do not treat you as an individual when changing a policy that affects you.
Framlingham,Fair,1/19/2016,3,"do not like position of screens. feel vulnerable with everyone looking at you.
Very good at coming out to our house when we need them"
Framlingham,Fair but hard to get appointment,3/20/2017,3,Difficult to get appointment.  Ringing at 8.50 am and constantly engaged.  Don't like being asked why I need to see a GP
Framlingham,Fair but long waits for routine appointments,3/20/2017,3,Dificult situation  - long waits for routine appointments
Framlingham,Fair but staff attitude inconsistent,3/20/2017,3,Poor staff attitude. It is not consistent.  Some staff are kind and caring but most of the time they are brusque
Framlingham,Find it is good when needed,2/27/2019,5,"I do not use this service often, but I find it very good when I have needed it. The staff are particularly good, I find them kind and caring."
Framlingham,Found everything good,2/27/2019,4,"I have found everything very good as I and when I have needed the service. Building work is disrupting the streets around the surgery, but is needed, so there is not answer really."
Framlingham,Generally poor.,12/17/2015,1,"Framlingham surgery has gone down hill so much, people say waste of time going, Dr's have no time for you. Staff are very poor and the seating in the waiting room they have changed is dreadful, we face the door and have to push past people to sit down. It is most people in Framlingham complaining."
Framlingham,Getting harder to get an appointment,5/8/2016,5,"Having been with the surgery for many years I have seen that although in the main things are good, it is becoming more and more difficult to get an appointment when you need one. It is necessary to travel the surgery to arrange an appointment. It can take 1-2 months for non urgent appointments when you try to book online."
Framlingham,getting though on telephone,2/27/2019,4,"It took about 15 minutes to get through on the telephone today.  It is rather frustrating, however I was able to get an appointment, but this does not always happen"
Framlingham,Given appointment with paramedic instead,6/28/2023,4,"I could not get a face to face appointment with the GP, but I knew I needed to be seen so I accepted the appointment offered with the paramedic, when I got in the appointment the paramedic had to ask the GP to come in a see me so I got to see the GP after all. I have found that the GP always has time for the patients and I always try to see the same doctor but that doesn't always work. The reception staff ask a lot of questions these days but I know its their job but their attitude is ok so thats fine."
Framlingham,Good,7/3/2019,4,GP listened to my concerns.  He explained two of the conditions  that two of our residents have and what has been done to assist their wellbeing and has followed up with a family member.  Interacts well with the residents and listens to them
Framlingham,Good,1/11/2016,4,"I have seen 2 GPs; one was not responsive, one was excellent"
Framlingham,good,7/3/2019,4,Running behind even with appointments.
Framlingham,good,7/3/2019,4,needs a water fountain
Framlingham,Good,7/3/2019,5,Dispensary staff can be abrupt.
Framlingham,Good - no problem getting appointment,1/11/2016,4,Pretty helpful and I don't have problems getting appointments
Framlingham,Good after initial two GP's,7/3/2018,5,"I saw two different GP's here as I was concerned about the symptoms I was getting over a period of time. Once I saw a third GP she was very thorough and got to the bottom of the problem which has been life changing. So the surgery is a good one, but can depend on the GP you see. My star rating is based on the GP I ended up seeing and her treatment of me."
Framlingham,Good but facilities poor,3/20/2017,4,Car parking hard now as less than 20 spaces.  Generally get appointment when I need one.  If I need a follow up appointment my GP books it at the time.  The waiting room is not set out very nicely as the screen is above door entrance So you stare at people coming into the surgery..  I feel very self conscious going into the surgery in my wheelchair as I usually catch something and when everyone is looking your way it is very embarrassing
Framlingham,Good but scruffy and unwelcoming,3/20/2017,4,It's a scruffy surgery.  All chairs facing door in waiting room.Just not welcoming at all
Framlingham,Good communication,9/29/2016,5,"Good communication, very clean, very confidential."
Framlingham,Good ok getting appointment,3/20/2017,4,When I need an appointment I generally get one.  Sometimes in 2 days.  I liked it when there was a nurse practitioner there
Framlingham,Got an appointment within a week,3/28/2016,4,I got an appointment to see both a doctor and a practice nurse within a week.  After I had consulted the doctor about my ailment I was asked if I had received a flu jab. I said I had unfortunately missed it. I was given one before I left the consulting room!
Framlingham,GP access non existent,8/13/2021,2,"I repeat what I have said for some time here. When Covid hit, the access to GP's became more of an issue for everyone, but I have been experiencing this before Covid hit, and now it just feels there is this new 'norm' of a phone call where you could be talking to any GP anywhere in the world. There well may be a shortage, but we need to know what is being done to help because if it continues to decrease, where will we be in 1, 2, 5 years time? The patients are suffering now from it. I personally have not 'seen' a GP but had phone calls but whilst this has sufficed a couple of times, a face to face appointment on a couple of other occasions would have been better. You just do not get the feeling of thoroughness by telephone."
Framlingham,Great service.,10/3/2016,5,Can always get an appointment within the week with one of the doctors. Sometimes have to wait a little longer to see a particular doctor.
Framlingham,Helpful and professional,6/10/2023,5,"The telephone system works well and the receptionists are knowledgeable and helpful. Maybe the wait to see a doctor is a tad overlong, but if you state your concerns, the message is passed on and you will get a phone call."
Framlingham,"Helpful receptionist, don't like waiting room",4/14/2015,3,"I don't like the layout of the surgery waiting room, not good having chairs in rows with our backs to the Reception."
Framlingham,I am not taken seriously,9/10/2019,3,"I feel my asthma is not taken seriously.
I only am every able to have one inhaler, so never have a spare. When I am particularly bad I am not prescribed steroids, like I used to be at my old surgery. This always dealt with the issue. I get palmed off with fleeting remarks like ""you seem OK now"" and nothing further is done.
I was asked to get a sample of my phlegm when it was an awful colour and typically could not make it shift enough to get a sample. They did nothing further.
I am not taken seriously and there is no care at all."
Framlingham,I forgive the lateness,2/25/2019,4,"Although it often runs behind when you have an appointment, you forgive it as the clinical staff show patience and care for you which takes extra time.  As I receive that I forgive the waiting."
Framlingham,I'd prefer to see same GP,1/29/2018,4,Not been under this surgery for long and so far it is fine. I would prefer to see same GP but this does not happen. I get stressed seeing different GP's who do not know me.
Framlingham,"In the main, good",1/29/2018,4,"apart from my appointment running quite late today, in the main the surgery is good"
Framlingham,Incompetence at all levels,2/19/2021,1,"For many years the Service provided has been in decline. Since Covid, it has been abhorrent. Whenever you ring, you are subjected to twenty questions from the arrogant receptionist, and if they condescendingly (begrudgingly even) think you warrant assistance, you might be granted an audience with a GP ... but frequently you are robbed off to an external provider because the gps cannot be bothered. 

Once you are lucky enough to obtain an appointment, albeit a telephone conversation, frequent mistakes are made. Prescriptions are assured but then forgotten to be written, leaving patients in agony for days. Blood tests are taken but no results shared ... until months later when a nurse rings, apologetically, to advise you might have type 2 diabetes. The list of incidents is vast.

Oh and by the way, despite it being the ONLY surgery serving a large town, they can’t be bothered to assist with administering Covid vaccines .... instead you have to take a 100 mile round trip. 

Little wonder GPs have gained a poor reputation during lockdown"
Framlingham,Issue to get seen by doctors,6/2/2023,1,"Long standing unresolved medical issue, which effects my daily life, cannot get to see doctor"
Framlingham,Issues around my prescription changes,1/29/2018,4,I have found that communicating across my prescriptions changes to the pharmacy has not always been in time for when I nee it changed or even stopped.
Framlingham,It's a postcode lottery,11/13/2019,4,Screening service for cancer prevention not being done at our surgery. Its a postcode lottery which is not right for such important things as cancer.
Framlingham,Kind and caring,2/27/2019,4,Appointment time running more than 15 minutes late today.  Not always easy to book and appointment but staff are kind and caring.
Framlingham,Kind and respectful,1/29/2018,4,"I have no problems with the staff, they always treat me kindly and respectfully"
Framlingham,KO - Excellent,3/16/2016,5,I have an excellent GP surgery - not often having to wait more than 24hours for an appointment
Framlingham,Lack of communication,8/17/2021,3,The surgery has changed beyond recognition over last couple of years. Not being able to see a GP is an issue for me with many conditions that are linked together. There needs to be better communication with us patients as the speculation is rife about what is going on. Not everyone goes on a website.
Framlingham,Layout of reception isn't nice,4/28/2015,3,"The nurses are very caring and efficient however, the layout in Reception isn't nice, having everyone in rows with their backs to reception. Much rather the TV/appointments screen was on a side wall with the chairs curved round to see the screen could help make the surgery feel friendlier."
Framlingham,Limited assistance restrictive contact,9/14/2021,1,"When trying to get pre university advice it was non existent for my daughter so she is having to rely on her university medical services, with my own condition the only support since lockdown is request for me to send my self read blood pressure reading and no continuation of pre lockdown support for my condition"
Framlingham,Look after me well,4/28/2015,4,My doctor and all the staff look after me well
Framlingham,Loose confidence in the service,8/13/2021,3,"I felt I needed to see a GP and ended up seeing a nurse. Went home, ended up in hospital with unseen issue which I am sure the GP would have picked up on. I respect the nurses that do what they do, but there are different levels of knowledge and for me that has now affected my confidence in the service, meaning I feel I need to demand to see a GP as I worry it will happen again."
Framlingham,Lovely service,9/23/2022,4,"This service has, for me, been really lovely. I have not needed much assistance beyond getting medication out of the dispensary, which is always on time. I'm under the Physio service at Aldeburgh too (Allied I think) and their system does not link to my GP record, so no information about my physio is seen by my GP to even say I am going to that service. Obviously a wider issue but feel worth flagging up."
Framlingham,Making on line appointments,1/24/2020,5,Staff are very amenable and always helpful. I normally make my appointments online and I can always get an appointment as I need one and on line works well for me. The only thing I would say is that the car park is too small.
Framlingham,Medical staff excellent but office staff can be abrupt,3/20/2017,5,Medical staff excellent.  Office staff can be abrupt
Framlingham,"Medical staff good, admin staff offhand",3/20/2017,4,Medical staff good.  Admin staff can be offhand
Framlingham,Mixed experience,8/17/2021,3,"Personally, I do not have complex health issues, so do not need to see a GP, and happy with talking with someone on the telephone. It is concerning though for my parents who are older and if I need to get them an appointment. They are hearing impaired, so the telephone does not work so well and you are not able to have a GP come to the house, due to capacity, which I understand. It is just worrying for them and they feel the care has gone."
Framlingham,Mixed feelings,6/19/2023,3,"I get a monthly blood check that's linked to hospital treatment and have no issues with that. All nurses I see are super lovely. I also now see a GP every few weeks and as they make the appointment I do not have to worry. My partner however, can not see anyone beyond a paramedic and at times feels a GP is needed."
Framlingham,Need calls not texts,6/24/2022,3,"I have asked the surgery to contact me by calling me, not texting me, as I find them confusing and I need to ask questions sometimes to that I fully understand what is being asked. But they still won't change it."
Framlingham,No complaints,1/29/2018,5,I do share the concern of many residents that services will be stretched when the new builds are complete. We will gain more residents who will need to access the service that I think is already at capacity.
Framlingham,No GP seen in ages,6/19/2023,2,I use the practice reasonably regularly and I have not seen a GP since before Covid. You see someone that you do not feel has solved much as the problem continues for months and months and then you still do not to get to see a GP. If I could move I would but no choice and I feel this is not a service fit for purpose as it cannot meet the needs of the population. Many older people like me need to see a GP as we have multiple complex needs/conditions.
Framlingham,No help offered,6/19/2023,2,"I was told today, that I cannot get any help on the NHS with my ears. That I cannot get syringing or hearing aids, yet I am holding a leaflet telling me I can get hearing aids!"
Framlingham,Non existent,6/20/2022,1,"Despite having doctor managed conditions, the only interaction in 3 years is for them to ask me to measure my own blood pressure once. I do have a prescription, but it is managed with pharmacy but any interaction with GP is by telephone appointment only."
Framlingham,"Occasional wait, and explainations hard to understand",6/22/2017,4,Occasionally we have to wait for appointment.  Explanations can be tricky!  Ohterwise excellent service
Framlingham,Only been a few times,2/27/2019,4,In the few experiences I have had (thankfully!) all aspects of the service I have received have been positive. No areas spring to ind that need improving
Framlingham,Overall good,9/23/2022,4,Overall this service is good. I would like to know when I come in for an appointment if they are running late. I was seen 30 minutes later today for my appointment. That was my only negative. I get my medication consistently on time and easily.
Framlingham,Overall good,2/27/2019,5,"It is really clean most the time. The staff are very helpful if you are not sure about something and approachable if you have a question.  The appointments do run late most of the time, which is ok if it is no more than 15-20 minutes, beyond that I find that more difficult."
Framlingham,Phone system issues,2/12/2021,3,"Getting through on the phone can take a while and I have also been cut off after being on the phone for over half an hour which is really frustrating. I've tried to use the online system but it needed to verify who I was and needed me to upload a photo which I was unable to do. When the surgery staff called me the phone identified them as coming from the Earl Soham surgery rather than Framlingham, they were then a little confused why I asked where the actual appointment would take place Earl Soham or Framlingham, I just wanted to check."
Framlingham,Poor,12/23/2015,1,"Where do you start?  You are never reassured.  The surgery is unfriendly.  The staff vary, some polite, others rude.  IF you can see a doctor they never have time to listen and are usually looking at their watches. you never feel that they have listened to you  so you never bother to go back.  Why do the seats face the door?"
Framlingham,Poor support,2/27/2019,4,In my experience I have received little support for my Mental Health.  The Counsillor I see at the surgery however is excellent.  Need better access and timely to a CPN.
Framlingham,poor treatment received,1/25/2020,1,"Dr I saw today was rude, no “bedside manner” made me feel like a number rather than a patient.  Didn’t listen to my symptoms or concerns about a potentially serious matter.  Consequently my condition was not dealt with and ended up having to seek further medical advice later in the day."
Framlingham,Poor. Long wait to see GP only to find he had left,7/9/2017,1,I was on the list for the doctor to see me.  I waited from 13.45 til nearly 16.00. When I decided to go out to find the carer in charge and asked if the doctor was working late I was told he had finished and gone. I was told that he said it would b aright to stop the nastier tablet and there would be no need for him to see me. There were other things I wished to discuss with him and now I will have to wait until next Tuesday.
Framlingham,Prescription ordering good,8/13/2021,4,"Getting my prescriptions on time (I order them online) is always without issue.
Trying to see a GP though is impossible. They had a sign up saying there were 'no clinicians on site', so this gave many cause for concern, including me. There is bound to be speculation on how the service is operating when a sign like that is put up with no further information."
Framlingham,Prompt service,2/27/2019,5,Received prompt advice over the 'phone from a GP and booked in promptly to see a nurse the following day.
Framlingham,Really good surgery,9/14/2018,4,This is a really good surgery. My only issue today is having to walk quite far around whilst the building work is on.  As I have a disability it is difficult
Framlingham,Reception lovely,1/29/2018,3,It really depends who you see here doctor wise. (patient did not wish to talk further)
Framlingham,Referral?,6/24/2022,3,I had a phone call from the Nurse practitioner as I had a wart and asked if they could remove it. I was told I have to have it done at the Nuffield. I still do not know if they actually referred me as I have not heard anything from anyone.
Framlingham,Referrals delayed,8/17/2018,3,"There have been delays with referrals and even when we were paying privately for  something to be done, they wouldn't allow another member of the family to pay it had to be me in person for some reason."
Framlingham,Saw us straight away,7/3/2018,4,"I have found the surgery to be consistently good. You can wait on the phone for a bit if you need to see someone on the day, but in general you did get an appointment on the day when you need one."
Framlingham,See a GP by now!,6/19/2023,2,I have been seeing a Paramedic here for ages about the same thing and not getting any resolution. I ask to see a GP and get nowhere. It goes on for ages and they need to get me seen by a GP but every time I call I get fobbed off onto a Paramedic.
Framlingham,See me when I need to,9/14/2018,5,Cannot speak highly enough of my treatment here. I have a number of health conditions and they see me for them when I feel I am concerned about something particular.
Framlingham,Staff are really friendly,12/17/2015,3,Staff are really friendly. The room however is set up unusually. As you walk in everyone is facing you which is very off putting. Seems like everyone is on top of you.
Framlingham,Surgery good most the time,1/29/2018,4,"This surgery is good most of the time. an increase of Framlingham population may make the surgery more pressurised. Appointments usually run late, but no more than 20 minutes."
Framlingham,Terrible!,2/18/2022,1,"Awful, rude receptionists (not all, but most). Very condescending when you ask to see a doctor! Can’t get an appointment to talk to a GP in the next month. A phone call to review asthma in a child? Paramedic seems to be the only person they give appointments to and they shouldn’t be seeing patients with some of the issues they have. Why are no GPs available?"
Framlingham,The medic seemed to be inexperienced,6/27/2023,4,"I asked to see my GP about a leg/knee problem I was having, I was given instead an appointment to see a medic who seemed to be inexperieced to me, he referred me to the physio team, but sadly didn't do too much for my problem. I wish our surgery was open Saturdays."
Framlingham,Things had to change,9/23/2022,4,"I have never seen a GP since Covid and things are not the same as they were previous to this, but they had to change as it is clear there is capacity issues everywhere.  Any clinicians I have seen sorts my issue. Things have changed and they are delivering what they can with what they have and I have no complaints about that as I have not had anything missed due to these changes. I continue to have confidence in the service."
Framlingham,Treated well,2/27/2019,5,Always feel listened to and treated well.
Framlingham,Unhelpful,12/23/2022,2,A family member hasn't had an annual review for a long time and they've not actually seen her even though there are multiple things going on.  When raising issues staff are unhelpful and don't even consider that some patients need carers to support them. I have complained in the past but it felt like I was just being a nuisance.  It's challenging to get appointments and then you're advised to go to A&E unnecessarily and you're told as much when you get to hospital.
Framlingham,Varies,6/19/2023,4,I do not use it very often but today I was seen and prescribed straight away so I felt that was good. my experience has varied.
Framlingham,Very good care,4/28/2015,4,Very good care and follow up. Friendly staff
Framlingham,Very good care and treatment,4/28/2015,4,"Attended a weekly clinic at Fram Surgery when I had a leg ulcer, very good care and treatment by the community nurse (based at Aldeburgh)"
Framlingham,Very helpful,7/11/2018,4,"I had been issued medication from the Nurse Practitioner that I had to bring back as I realised when I got home it was the same one that I have a had a bad reaction to the last time I had it. They were very helpful at sorting that out quickly for me. The record did not show the bad reaction, so was no ones fault. I will ensure I check in the bag to be sure next time before I leave as I realise the medication can not then be reissued. Last couple of days both the receptionists have been lovely."
Framlingham,Very impressed,1/29/2018,5,I have moved into this area and so far I have been very impressed with this surgery
Framlingham,Very poor service for critically ill patient,7/9/2017,1,"Request to go on Gold Standard Framework due to very ill health.  

Proper correct evaluation of the condition. The resident was at the end stages of a chronic illness. If the issues had been addressed correctly (deterioration, pain, confusion) then pre-emptive drugs would have been prescribed in time. Instead they were delayed and were not available when the end of life came. Just because they are in residential care and not able to express themselves they should not be treated as a nuisance and too time consuming."
Framlingham,Visited two different doctors,4/28/2015,1,"Visited in 2014 with a very painful and swollen foot, doctor suggested I take paracetamol. It took another doctor at a different surgery to suggest an x-ray which found a broken bone."
Framlingham,Waiting can be a long time,7/10/2018,4,"The surgery overall is good, however waiting times at appointments can be rather long."
Framlingham,Waiting for appointments,6/9/2016,5,"Can be waiting for 20-30 minutes even with an appointment.  It would be good to be told this, then you do not mind as much"
Framlingham,Waiting room set up not nice,1/29/2018,4,"The surgery in itself is good. I just find the waiting room set up difficult as I am a self-conscious person and coming into the surgery with everyone looking at me, it is daunting."
Framlingham,Waiting times need improving,5/8/2016,4,"The waiting times are getting really bad to get an appointment and then the surgery barely ever runs on time. I do not like the way the surgery is set out, it makes you feel like you are at school. I also feel that receptionists look down their noses at you, like they are better than everyone else."
Fressingfield,A caring surgery,2/28/2019,5,"Staff are so friendly and helpful. Within reason you can get appointments to see a specific doctor in a week. A very caring surgery, doctors really listen to you. I use online systems for booking appointments and prescriptions which both work well. Staff have good judgement about the level of information/ explanation required."
Fressingfield,A Good Practice,1/24/2020,5,"An overall very good practice, no changes needed."
Fressingfield,A little trying,12/14/2021,4,"Its been a little bit trying trying to get a blood test appointment which I need before a hospital appointment taking place later this week. Staff are very good, not sure why an appointment system with allocated times is used as they are never on time, you might as well have a wait your turn system. Other than that nothing else needs to change."
Fressingfield,A really good service,8/4/2016,5,A really good service.
Fressingfield,A really good surgery,5/8/2016,5,Its a really good surgery. They informed me about the gluten free prescription changes and they keep a close eye on me too.
Fressingfield,Able to get appointments easily,1/24/2020,5,"I came in for an emergency appointment today, we get excellent service here, cannot fault anything. Staff excellent."
Fressingfield,Accomodating,2/28/2019,5,"You can always get appointments, usually with the doctor you want but if its an emergency you may not - which is absolutely fine. They are very accommodating for my needs."
Fressingfield,All works,12/13/2021,5,"There are no particular issues getting appointments and it all works, there are few delays getting through. Nothing really needs to improve though and the flu clinic was very well run."
Fressingfield,Always able to get appointments very caring .,9/19/2018,5,"Good, staff were very friendly caring and understanding in all departments. Drs all great,I have every confidence in them my own Dr (name) is wonderful with my elderly parents ."
Fressingfield,Always get an appointment,1/22/2020,5,We can always get at appointment. I often find there is miscommunication with the dispensary and patients. Compared with my previous surgery Fressingfield is so much better.
Fressingfield,Always good,11/28/2022,5,"The surgery has always been good. I spoke with reception and asked to see a doctor and have been given one for later in the morning. Staff and clinicians are good and explain issues well, nothing needs to improve it all works really well."
Fressingfield,Always perfect.,8/24/2019,5,I feel that everything here is always perfect. Never had any difficulty getting an appointment.
Fressingfield,Appointments available,12/13/2021,5,"I've not had any problems getting appointments for my young son, it's all worked really well."
Fressingfield,Appointments available when needed,2/28/2019,5,Can always get an appointment when needed and the nursing care is very good. Waiting to see the nurse or doctor can sometimes take a long time after arriving.
Fressingfield,Brilliant,11/28/2022,5,"Fantastic surgery. Very quickly called in to the surgery this morning for an appointment, seen within 2 hours of calling, which is great. The staff are lovely, and they explain issues and answer questions well, even if it is the silliest of questions. They saw my child urgently, when they were closing recently, after they fell and hit their head, and that was so reassuring and good of them."
Fressingfield,Can't fault this surgery.,8/24/2019,5,"I can't fault this surgery GP is patient and calm, an old school GP. 'My hero'. Staff are very friendly and polite. The GPs explanations are excellent and I feel we are very lucky. I can talk about anything."
Fressingfield,Car park may be an issue,2/28/2019,5,Care is good and staff attitude is very good at the surgery. The car park may be a problem as the village grows in size.
Fressingfield,Car Park too small,1/22/2020,5,I would consider this surgery to be very good. It needs a bigger car park though and it only has one disabled space.
Fressingfield,Care is good,11/28/2022,4,"I've always found the surgery to be good and I can get appointments whenever they are needed. The care is good, but the only frustrating thing is that the doctors do run late and even at 10am they are behind. Having the nurses to do appointments is great and overall the surgery works well."
Fressingfield,Care is good,2/26/2019,4,A good surgery where treatment is explained well and the quality of care is good.
Fressingfield,Choice of appointment style,12/14/2021,5,"I've had no problem getting an appointment and have been offered a choice of appointment, either telephone call or face to face. The staff are brilliant, helpful and kind and do all they can for you. The car park is busy and it would be nice to have a water machine available."
Fressingfield,Comfortable.,8/24/2019,5,"Phoned for an appointment this morning and was offered an immediate slot. Comfortable light in any waiting room, plenty of information in the waiting room."
Fressingfield,Continuity is important,11/28/2022,5,"Most of the time it's fine to get an appointment. Sometimes it's a bit hard to see a specific GP, probably because he is amazing and patients have a good rapport with him. I can't praise him enough. The kids are seen whenever there is a problem and although they are under a lot of pressure you are able to get seen. Continuity is important but for urgent issues it's not needed as much"
Fressingfield,Easy to get appointments,1/24/2020,4,The location of the surgery is very handy for me living in the village. The doctors have always been very helpful to me and I can always get an appointment if I need one.
Fressingfield,Excellent,11/28/2022,5,"I find the surgery excellent with me. Pre booked appointments with the doctors are fine to get and I've never had any problems getting an appointment. The clinicians are great, caring and very good at supporting me."
Fressingfield,Excellent service.,8/24/2019,5,"Excellent service. No long delays to see a GP, good staff."
Fressingfield,Excellent.,8/24/2019,5,I feel we have an excellent practice.
Fressingfield,Excellent.,8/24/2019,4,"Excellent. Generally, staff at reception and dispensary are very good, some better than others."
Fressingfield,Fair,6/21/2016,3,Running slightly late sometimes
Fressingfield,Fair,6/21/2016,3,running slightly late sometimes
Fressingfield,Fantastic.,8/24/2019,5,"I have only been here 2-3 weeks, but so far the doctor and staff have been fantastic. Every time I'm listened to explained and helped with."
Fressingfield,Feel rushed,8/24/2019,4,It would be helpful to have a better explanation of what is being done and any alternative options. I often feel rushed or put off when I come for help. Sometimes I even feel dismissed or ignored.
Fressingfield,Feel treated as an individual.,8/24/2019,5,"Always find an appointment for me and my husband. I feel treated as an individual some years ago the surgery acted in an amazing way, identifying what was wrong withy husband at the time. The front desk staff are consistently good."
Fressingfield,Fine at the moment,12/13/2021,5,"I can see who I want, when I need to and the staff are lovely, I think they're really good. The nurse practitioners are really good, they spend time with you and give good advice. With the additional cleaning taking place it seems that there are slightly more delays and I wonder whether patients are still only allocated the same amount of time as before?"
Fressingfield,First class,8/24/2019,5,"Had a TIA 4 weeks ago, response from all staff as I walked in a little confused and unsure what to do was first class."
Fressingfield,Flexible appointments,2/26/2019,4,Appointment times are often available when you're not at work.
Fressingfield,Fortunate to be a patient here.,8/24/2019,5,"I count myself as fortunate to be a patient here. There is nothing I could find to complain about. GP usually running late, but I know that he gives all his patient, including me, as much time as they need.Phone is answered promptly."
Fressingfield,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,4,I find the surgery to be good and the care provided by staff friendly. Appointments are easy enouogh to get and I have no particular problems at the suregry.
Fressingfield,Frontline staff can be abrupt,2/28/2019,4,At times some frontline staff can be abrupt when dealing with you and the communication between receptionists isn't alway great but the care provided is very good and treatments are explained well.
Fressingfield,Good,7/3/2019,4,They do blood tests and minor operations.  I never have to wait too long as I phone at 8 am
Fressingfield,Good care of children,2/28/2019,5,"Had no problems registering. They offer really good care of children when they are unwell, even calling during the day to check how they are. Wonderful."
Fressingfield,Good care provided,2/28/2019,5,The care and staff at the surgery are very good. Waiting times in the surgery can sometimes be a bit long.
Fressingfield,Good for appointments,1/24/2020,3,Getting an appointment is good and overall I am happy with this surgery but the main issue for me is that it is difficult waiting for such a long time in the surgery to be seen with small children.
Fressingfield,Good surgery,9/2/2016,5,"A good surgery, have no problems getting appointments and having the other surgery makes it easier to see the doctor you want."
Fressingfield,Great practice,4/16/2019,5,The doctors at the surgery are incredibly supportive and really do help get my father the care and support he needs. They phone to check he's ok and if I need anything all I have to do is call. They are amazing.
Fressingfield,Great practice,2/28/2019,5,The surgery is very good and I can't fault the practice at all. If the doctors are running late you may have to arrive early to get a car parking space.
Fressingfield,Great surgery,1/8/2018,5,"A great surgery. Can get appointments when needed and never have any problems. Care from doctors is good, it's a nice surgery."
Fressingfield,Happy,8/24/2019,4,"Care navigation isn't a problem. Very happy with the surgery generally, never had any problems."
Fressingfield,Happy with dr's and nurses,11/28/2022,3,"Not consistently given the choice of an appointment or a phone call, it depends who you speak to. There are times when right from the start of the conversation the member of staff is a little abrupt and even rude at times as they won't let you get across why you need an appointment. The reception staff at Stradbroke are great. It doesn't take long to get through to the surgery on the phone but I'm happy with the doctors and nurses. I just don't like having to say the reason for an appointment to reception if you are having a bad mental health day and are then quizzed by staff it isn't easy."
Fressingfield,Helpful and friendly.,8/24/2019,5,"Helpful and friendly. Never feel rushed, always very helpful with appointments. We did have a bit of a wait on a blood test that had to be sent to Addenbrooke's, the communication could have been improved, but other than that it is an excellent surgery."
Fressingfield,Helpful staff,12/14/2021,5,I've had no problems getting appointments and they offered telephone or an in person appointment. Staff are helpful and I'm happy to see both the nurses and the doctors depending on the situation. The car park is a little limited.
Fressingfield,I feel spoilt at this surgery,1/24/2020,5,"We can easily get appointments, staff and the doctors are all excellent. I feel spoilt here, we are so lucky, I have been coming here for 19 years."
Fressingfield,I have Confidence in my GP,1/24/2020,4,"I am very confident in what my GP says. My GP is very thorough and refers well to the hospital as needed. I do always have to wait at appointment quite a while before I am called through, but its ok as he is such a good doctor so I am prepared to wait."
Fressingfield,I never have to wait too long,7/19/2016,4,They do blood tests and minor operations.  I never have to wait too long as I phone at 8 am.
Fressingfield,I rate my GP very highly.,8/24/2019,4,"I rate my GP very highly. I prefer not to sign in using the sign in screen, I fear we are losing the personal touch..."
Fressingfield,Kind and unhurried.,8/24/2019,5,"The community is very fortunate to have this centre. Everyone is very helpful, kind, and unhurried."
Fressingfield,Lengthy wait to see GP,1/24/2020,4,Lengthy wait to be able to see GP of choice. However we do consider we are very lucky to belong to this surgery.
Fressingfield,Long phone message,11/28/2022,4,"Never had any problems and have had a planned appointment which was arranged last week. Most of the time I see my own GP which I feel is better but if its urgernt I'm happy to see anyone. There is a very long message on the phone still and the cost of calling is a consideration, it seems unnecessarily long."
Fressingfield,Long wait in the waiting room,1/24/2020,5,"Time waiting in the waiting room is quite long, but I never feel rushed by my doctor, I know that he is being thorough. A very good surgery overall."
Fressingfield,Long wait to be seen at appointment,1/24/2020,4,"This surgery is excellent but I have to say that I do have quite a wait at appointment to be seen, I can wait 30-45 mins before getting called in. They have made good referrals to the hospital in the past."
Fressingfield,Marvellous,1/24/2020,5,"This really is a marvellous surgery, the doctors and nurses and all of the staff really are very good we are very lucky to have it."
Fressingfield,Marvellous nurse,11/28/2022,5,I'm seeing the nurse on a weekly basis at the moment for a dressing and it's great to see the same nurse each time as they can monitor how the wound is progressing and healing. It's a very good surgery and my appointments at the moment are booked each time I see the nurse which works really well.
Fressingfield,More than good,12/14/2021,5,The surgery is more than good. You can choose if you want an in person appointment or a telephone call depending on the situation and the staff are brilliant.
Fressingfield,Never had a problem,12/13/2021,4,The surgery perform very well and I've never had a problem or any issues getting appointments in a suitable time frame.
Fressingfield,Never rushed but you have to wait often,1/22/2020,5,"Quite often you have to wait beyond the given appointment time, but I do not consider this to be a disadvantage as my doctor never seems to rush me, he always gives me the time I need, he has a very caring attitude."
Fressingfield,No issues,2/28/2019,5,Parking at the surgery is an issue but other than that there are no problems.
Fressingfield,Nurse been very good,2/28/2019,5,"The service is absolutely brilliant. Its very efficient and staff are good at their jobs. The diabetic nurse is very informative, brilliant.  Its very quick to get appointments and you can see the same GP, they have time for you and is very thorough. Very good doctors and the nurse has been good too. I'm also happy to visit either surgery."
Fressingfield,Nurses are excellent here,1/24/2020,5,"They are very good here, the nurses have been excellent, I have had to have blood tests pre chemo treatment and they are all very good and caring here. Sometimes the GP can be running overtime but overall I could not wish for a better experience for a surgery."
Fressingfield,Nurses brilliant,2/28/2019,5,"Communication between patient and whole surgery / staff is very good. Never have any problems getting appointments and always see the same doctor, especially with an ongoing condition. The nurses are brilliant, diabetic checks are very good, very caring approach. Good to have call backs from the doctor, they work well."
Fressingfield,ongoing investigation of my illness,5/8/2016,5,"the surgery itself is really good. I have had numerous tests as I am now having to use sticks and no one seems to know why my mobility is getting worse. I have had neurological tests, CFS tests and Arthritic tests. They are good at trying to find answers but we still do not know what is wrong with me which concerns me a great deal.  The staff are very pleasant and most of the time I can get an appointment when I need one, which of late is quite often."
Fressingfield,Outstanding GP,1/24/2020,5,"A great surgery, GP care is exceptional all round exceptional, understanding problems and very clear explanations. You just have to wait."
Fressingfield,Outstanding staff,2/26/2019,4,"Outstanding staff, who go beyond the norm. Appointments are now taking longer if you want to see a particular doctor."
Fressingfield,Overall pretty good,2/28/2019,5,"Occasionally reception staff can be tricky, but overall they are a pretty good surgery with very good doctors and nursing team."
Fressingfield,Personable staff,12/14/2021,5,"I tend to see the nurses more than a doctor and have regular blood tests which are fine to arrange. The referrals that have been done for me have been quick with no issues and the staff are personable. They know me well as a person, it all works well."
Fressingfield,Personal and thoughtful,2/28/2019,5,"Fantastic surgery. Staff are always kind and you never feel like a burden with any of the staff, all are very personal and offer a thoughtful approach. They will fit you in whenever you need an appointment. Can't fault the surgery at all, a really stand out service."
Fressingfield,Pleasant,8/24/2019,5,"Always have to wait outside of appointment time, but not a problem. This should mean patients are getting the time they need. Overall, a very well run and pleasant experience."
Fressingfield,Rarely see doctor on time.,8/24/2019,4,"Rarely see the doctor at the appointment time, but not unhappy with care generally."
Fressingfield,Really good nurses,12/13/2021,4,I would prefer more face to face appointments as mostly phone calls are offered and I worry that something will be missed. I do see the nurses who are really good. When I've had blood tests I've been told that someone will call with the results but they don't.
Fressingfield,Really helpful,11/28/2022,5,"Everyone is really helpful and friendly, on the phone or face-to-face. I'm able to get appointments whenever I need, and my preference is listened to. I was referred quickly for a mammogram within two weeks, and the nurses have been very good and so supportive. It's working very well as a surgery."
Fressingfield,Reception staff go out of their way to help,1/24/2020,5,I regularly have to wait 30-60 mins before I get called through to the doctors room. The nurse tends to keep to schedule better. The front desk staff are excellent they go out of their way to help. I am a bit concerned about the houses due to be being built and how that will impact on the GP surgery.
Fressingfield,So far so good,1/24/2020,5,"I am a new patient and so far all seems fine, staff are very good and helpful."
Fressingfield,So lucky,8/24/2019,5,We are so lucky with the team here - full marks!
Fressingfield,Some music would help,1/22/2020,5,"Excellent personal one to one care at this surgery, some music would help pass the time when waiting to be seen, it may also act as a distraction."
Fressingfield,Staff are good,12/13/2021,4,"Can get either a face to face or telephone call back with a GP, there are a little longer waits for non urgent issues but that's completely understandable at the moment. Staff are good and get everything sorted out."
Fressingfield,Staff attitude good.,8/24/2019,4,"There was a computerised technical issue last week which apparently caused me to be an hour late. Staff attitude is particularly good, always able to help with appointments. Wish the car park was bigger."
Fressingfield,Staff could acknowledge you,2/26/2019,4,I would prefer it if pharmacy staff could acknowledge you when you are waiting to be served. The care though is very good.
Fressingfield,Staff explain issues well,12/14/2021,4,"It's not as easy as it was but for routine issues it works well with no huge waits. Staff explain issues well and I haven't felt rushed in an appointment even when they are running behind. There must be capacity issues, time allowed for each appointment really needs to be longer."
Fressingfield,Staff lovely,12/13/2021,5,"I got an appointment this morning and have routine appointments booked in advance too. Staff are always lovely and explain everything well, 10/10. I haven't had a review for a while due to the pandemic and the car park is quite small so these could be improved."
Fressingfield,Surgery chases up hospital referrals,1/24/2020,5,"A general wait of 30 mins in the waiting area. THe doctors are very good and the nurses are good too, the nurses tend to be on time schedule with their appointments than the doctors. They are also good at chasing up hospital referrals."
Fressingfield,They cope very well,4/16/2019,5,The surgery is very good and they cope very well . It may take a little more time to see a specific doctor but they are so good and supportive of me as a carer . The doctors really care and will discuss issues on the phone so I don't have to go in all the time.
Fressingfield,They do very well,12/13/2021,5,"Generally a very good surgery, staff explain things well and I've never had a problem. It would be nice if when a GP goes on holiday if you were able to book an appointment for when they return online rather than having to wait for their first day back to be able to call and book then. The car park is small and a bit limited but probably not much that can be done."
Fressingfield,They're doing well,12/13/2021,4,I have regular appointments and don't have any problems getting them when I need them. Staff explain issues very well and I think they are doing well all considering.
Fressingfield,Try to see same GP,11/28/2022,5,I do use the online system to book appointments but had to wait 3 weeks to see a specific doctor. Instead I swapped the appointment with a family member and got to see them in 4 days. I do try to see the same GP if at all possible but it's not always necessary.  Using the NHS App for prescriptions is now working  and it is very convenient.
Fressingfield,Very caring,8/24/2019,5,"Very caring and friendly and helpful. GPs give plenty of time and I don't feel rushed. I usually have to wait 2-3 days to get an appointment, we do get asked if we would like a GP call back. They do give good hospital referrals if needed."
Fressingfield,Very friendly staff,2/28/2019,4,"It's very good to call at the beginning of the week to get an appointment but from Wednesday onwards its more difficult. All the staff are very friendly and having the dispensary at the surgery is really helpful. Doctors are open to discussing different options and ideas and the nurses are great. They are so friendly they put you at ease, the nurse practitioner is very good. The reception staff will always fit you in if its an emergency. It would be nice if a patient is a vegan or vegetarian if this could be on their notes as many medications have gelatin in them. Its a good idea to have a blood pressure machine  in the waiting area, are there any other self care."
Fressingfield,Very good,11/28/2022,5,Appointments are easy to get when I've needed them and I've found the telephone consultations also work well to address issues too. I've been able to get blood tests easily enough too.
Fressingfield,Very good,8/17/2018,5,Generally a very good surgery where you can get appointments when you need them without any problems. Very happy with the care provided.
Fressingfield,Very good care,11/28/2022,5,There are no issues with the surgery. I called this morning and was offered an appointment with the nurse. I had a 2 or 3 minute wait on the phone and spoke with a very good care navigator who listened to me and then arranged my appointment.
Fressingfield,Very happy,12/13/2021,5,"A very good surgery with incredibly helpful staff who try hard to be accommodating. I've had both phone and in person appointments which have all worked well, phone calls are more appropriate for some issues."
Fressingfield,Very happy,8/24/2019,5,"Don't mind waiting because the staff give the time that is needed with patients. Other than that, very happy."
Fressingfield,Very helpful and caring.,8/24/2019,5,I never mind if there is a bit of a delay for appointment especially if an emergency as grateful they have seen me at short notice. Drs always very helpful and caring.
Fressingfield,Very impressed,1/24/2020,5,I phoned this morning for an urgent appointment and they got us in.
Fressingfield,Very lucky,12/14/2021,5,I feel we are very lucky to have such an amazing surgery. You're offered either a telephone call or a face to face and the choice is yours which is great. There are really good staff and doctors and nurses are wonderful.
Fressingfield,Very pleasant,2/26/2019,4,The GPs at the surgery are very pleasant and I've never had any issues at the practice getting appointments.
Fressingfield,Very satisfied,12/13/2021,4,Everything at the surgery is ok and I've not had any issues. Depending on the situation a phone call back from the doctor works well and a face to face is not necessary. Staff are always very polite.
Fressingfield,Wait too long at appointment,1/22/2020,4,Waiting times at appointment could be improved but it seems worth the wait when you get there.
Fressingfield,Wait up to an hour in waiting room,1/24/2020,4,"Waiting to see the GP can be a long wait at the surgery, it can sometimes be up to an hour. Everything else is very good and I do not have any complaints."
Fressingfield,Waiting is an issue,2/26/2019,4,The only problem at the surgery is the waiting time to be seen and I can only see this getting worse with more housing. Parking can also be an issue.
Fressingfield,We are extremely fortunate,1/24/2020,4,This is an excellent surgery and compared with most surgeries that I hear about I think we are extremely fortunate.
Fressingfield,Willing doctors,1/24/2020,4,"Staff very helpful and kind, doctors willing to help as needed. I am very pleased with this surgery no changes needed."
Fressingfield,Wish for better parking,8/24/2019,5,Wish there were better parking facilities. Have experienced some delays but understand the reasons why.
Fressingfield,Wonderful reception staff,12/13/2021,5,I know that if I need an appointment on the day I will get one and staff do their very best in every way. It is a little bit more of a wait for non urgent issues but if urgent I've been given appointments. All the staff are fantastic and reception staff are always wonderful. I'm very grateful to have such a great surgery.
Fressingfield,Works very well,12/14/2021,4,"Haven't had any problems getting an appointment. I'm seeing the nurse and didn't have to wait too long to be seen. The staff are very helpful and I've never had a problem with the surgery, it generally works very well for me."
Fressingfield,Works well,12/14/2021,5,"At the moment I have no issues as given a choice over appointments including times to suit. The staff are lovely, always helpful and it works well."
Fressingfield,Worth the wait,1/22/2020,5,"Excellent surgery but the waiting time at appointment could be better, but it is worth the wait."
Glemsford,A fantastic team...,5/18/2017,5,"Reception always do their best to help and are always friendly, and have gone above and beyond. 

All three GPs  go above and beyond to listen, help and support. Needless to say, all are fantastic with children too. 

The nurses are extremely lovely and really do have the time for you. 

Pharmacy and just brilliant and are very helpful."
Glemsford,A good service,10/5/2018,5,"It's a good service, I have a good relationship with the GPs I see and I'm happy to see different doctors. Staff are helpful and will try to do all they can to get you fitted in."
Glemsford,A good team,10/5/2018,5,I manage to get appointments when I need them and don't use the surgery much. There's a good team and I don't have any issues.
Glemsford,A wonderful team,12/23/2020,5,"From reception to GP always so kind, considerate, helpful and caring with GPs showing unconditional positive regard. Nurses and pharmacy team also lovely. GP's are have always been thorough and listen, and so helpful in a time when my mental health has been really difficult - and the reception are very understanding with this too.

Understandably waiting times are sometimes long, but knowing the care I've had by team there, Id rather that, then a rush in rush out service with no care."
Glemsford,Accommodating - always try and fit you in,2/22/2018,5,They will always try to get you in. They've been very accommodating recently getting appointments when I've needed them.
Glemsford,All good,7/13/2023,5,"Very pleased as I spoke to reception and have been given an appointment. I didn't have to wait long on the phone when calling in and have had good continuity with the doctor I've seen, although I'd be happy to see any of the doctors, they're great."
Glemsford,All very good,12/20/2018,5,I can get appointments when I need them and its all been very good. I have had one occasion when a member of staff didn't really look in to something prior to an appointment but it all worked out in the end.
Glemsford,Always trusted and helped me out,5/10/2020,5,"A doctor here is probably the best doctor I have met and the rest of the team are all really good at there jobs.

I was in a car accident and during the recovery stage in hospital the doctor called to see how I was and catch up with me as he saw my notes of what had happened, what doctors surgery do this for the patients? 
Just lovely people. 

Thank you for everything, all of you."
Glemsford,Become more difficult to get appointments,8/31/2018,3,"It has become more difficult  to get appointments with a doctor and you are now encouraged to see a nurse practitioner which has been appropriate in most situations although I did have an experience that wasn't so good. The receptionists are fantastic, friendly, efficient, always smiling and helpful."
Glemsford,Been excellent with the children,10/5/2018,5,"Its a good local surgery, you can always get an appointment when needed. It's very handy to have the pharmacy on site. They have been excellent with the children."
Glemsford,Been good,7/13/2023,4,"Its been good for me and I've found the staff friendly but a family member has had more issues and when they tried to arrange travel vaccinations and other paperwork that was needed they were told the member of staff wasn't available and then the doctor couldn't do what was needed either, there was no signposting offered either."
Glemsford,Been with surgery for years changed considera,7/31/2022,3,Trying to get through is difficult you get told to ring at 8 in morning but even on ringing at 8 Monday morning  and being first in queue told no appointments  . How can that be when they don't let you book appointments beforehand. I've been first in queue then get cut off so try to ring again then about 10 in queue. I don't like explaining my problems to receptionist. I used to tell people how brilliant our surgery was and great doctors but since being taken over by West Suffolk its changed for the worse. Like speaking to same doctor as although another doctor can see everything on computer they really don't know the patient personally. Doctor can be bit sarcastic.
Glemsford,Best doctor ever seen,11/28/2022,4,"The doctor I'm seeing is the best I've ever seen, they have time to listen and are interested in solving the problem. Reception have been very good as they ask the right amount of questions to get an appointment. The carpets do really need to be replaced as they are very stained and painting needs to be done as its all looking a little tired and dirty.  At times medications haven't been available from the on site pharmacy and I've had to take my prescription to another pharmacy."
Glemsford,Best GP service I’ve used,9/3/2021,5,"I’m so impressed. The receptionists, doctors and pharmacy are fabulous and friendly as a new patient. I’m highly impressed"
Glemsford,Better than it was,11/28/2022,5,"Can actually get appointments more easily now and reception staff are more pleasant than they were. The phone system is also better as it now has a queue, rather than having to keep calling back, and it appears appointments are easier to get too. The telephone consultations have worked well in most situations, but they can be difficult as my wife is hard of hearing."
Glemsford,Can always get an appointment,12/24/2018,5,"You can always get an appointment when you phone up, very helpful and can't do enough for you. You may have to wait a little on the phone in the morning but you do get through. The surgery has been very good to me, very helpful and friendly. It would be nice if there was a water machine in the waiting room. The wait to see your doctor can be a bit long but I'm given enough time in your own appointment."
Glemsford,Caring staff,12/21/2018,5,I can always get an appointment when I need one and see the nurse on a regular basis. They are very good and caring staff.
Glemsford,Clinical advice OK. Everything Else Poor.,6/13/2019,3,"Difficult to get through on phone. I have stood at the counter and seen staff chatting while phones ring out. Have twice heard appointment staff advise people to say they have an emergency in order to get same day appointment. Wrote to the practice, they think they are great - though and was advised to go somewhere in an arrogant and defensive letter that failed to address my politely phrased concerns."
Glemsford,Conflicting advice,8/23/2019,1,"I have had different advice from two different Dr's at this practise which I found frustrating as you don't know who to believe! I also find the receptionists very aggressive in their tone if you dare to ask for anything other than a routine appointment. I have a choice to move elsewhere, I will now do that."
Glemsford,Confusing covid 19 posters,12/5/2020,1,A simple call from a Dr would have been great at this time. Instead I had to deal with reception 4 times and came to the surgery only to find confusing posters about covid 19. I still came away without an answer and no HRT prescription. I needed simple health advice but didn't get any.
Glemsford,Difficult to get an urgent appointment,8/31/2018,3,"Its been difficult to get an urgent appointment, when we did get an appointment there was little examination  carried out and we then had to return a couple of days later for another appointment. It felt that we were being fobbed off and our concerns dismissed. One of the doctors has been amazing, very reassuring and friendly. The nurse has been lovely too, very good with my son."
Glemsford,Disappointed after 70 yrs,1/20/2022,2,After being at the practice for 70 years I was given two weeks notice to find another surgery to register at as I was outside their catchment area. I don't feel the way it was done was very good and I'm now worried if I'll be able to get my medications in time.
Glemsford,Doctor listen,8/31/2018,4,"I've found the GPs all very good, they really listen to you and don't question why you are there.I like having the pharmacy on site and that you can have everything done here from blood tests to seeing a nurse. It would be nice if the staff at the pharmacy would check a little more often to see if a patient is waiting to be helped."
Glemsford,Doctors care good,8/31/2018,4,You get a friendly welcome and the care from doctors is good. It is a little more difficult to get a quick appointment but this has been the case over the last year or so.
Glemsford,"Doing well, nothing to change",2/22/2018,5,"Made an appointment this morning, mid-way through the morning, and was given an appointment virtually straight away. Normally phone but couldn't get through, so I was surprised when we got an appointment. I really don't think there is anything that needs to change, they are doing well."
Glemsford,Easy enough to get appointment,10/5/2018,5,"New registration went well, had an appointment was easy enough to get."
Glemsford,Easy to get appointments,10/5/2018,5,"Easy to get appointments, the on site pharmacy is useful and Doctors follow up on discussions they've had."
Glemsford,excellent,9/14/2017,5,They have been really good with my mum.  They visited dad whenever we needed and were wonderful
Glemsford,excellent,6/11/2015,5,Dr. (Name removed) - excellent - explains everything.  Time no object
Glemsford,Excellent - always.,12/31/2019,5,First class service - just wonderful
Glemsford,Excellent surgery,3/13/2019,5,Having the pharmacy and nurses on site is very good. Waiting times are well managed and staff are accommodating and do all they can to get you seen. Communication between West Suffolk Hospital and the surgery has been slow.
Glemsford,Exceptionally happy with this surgery,6/18/2019,5,Good customer service both in reception and pharmacy. They go above and beyond. Waiting times at appointment can be variable but recently pretty good.  Exceptionally happy with this surgery.
Glemsford,Friendly and accomodating,10/5/2018,5,More than happy with the surgery. Reception are always very friendly and  accommodating. I called this morning and was given an appointment straight away. I do miss the Hartest surgery but the care is still very friendly. Having the pharmacy on site is great and they've also delivered medication to Hartest quickly in the past.
Glemsford,Friendly and efficient,10/5/2018,5,All very friendly and efficient I never have a problem getting an appointment. Its nice to have a balance of advance appointments and on the days.
Glemsford,Friendly doctors,8/31/2018,5,You can always get an appointment at the surgery and the doctors are very friendly. The car park is very busy so it can be difficult to park and if you're unwell sometimes you don't want to walk further.  It can feel like you're being asked for a lot of information about why the appointment is needed.
Glemsford,Friendly kind and approachable,3/13/2019,4,"Have struggled to get children's vaccinations on time and they are now overdue, the first time was because a doctor and nurse couldn't be on site at the same time. For GP appointments though you do have to call on the morning to get one which can be frustrating. It would be better if new patients could register online as trying to get to the surgery following a c section and not being able to drive was difficult."
Glemsford,Friendly staff,8/31/2018,4,"Initially today it was a bit difficult to get an appointment, but this is unusual. Staff are friendly and approachable and good explanations are provided."
Glemsford,Friendly staff,2/22/2018,5,"Friendly, accommodating and approachable staff. Happy with the locums seen. called this morning."
Glemsford,Friendly surgery,10/5/2018,5,"A friendly surgery, generally you can get an appointment when you need them. I don't feel that doctors always listen like they may be need to and just treat with out looking for further issues."
Glemsford,Getting appointments isn't easy,6/2/2023,3,"Getting through on the phone to the surgery is ok but getting appointments is more difficult. I'm not a fan of the care navigation as I don't like them asking why I need an appointment and what the issues are. Today has been very good, I called up, spoke to the doctor and was given an appointment to see them straight away, so very pleased with how it worked today to get the treatment needed.  I do feel a cancer referral took a little time to come.  I first raised concerns in summer and it wasn't until Christmas that a referral was made.  I'm now having to wait for the treatment after seeing the consultant at Sudbury Health Centre."
Glemsford,Good,3/20/2017,4,Don't have to wait too long to get to see a GP and generally a good surgery
Glemsford,Good and straightforward service.,11/20/2017,5,No problems getting appointments. Staff have been good too: care provided is good and it works well for me.
Glemsford,Good care from doctors,8/31/2018,5,Friendly and really good doctors who provide very good care. Carry on as you are and please don't leave.
Glemsford,Good first impression,12/20/2018,5,"Its quick to get appointments, a nice friendly surgery. Registration as a new patient went smoothly and its been a good first impression with good information provided. So far a really great friendly surgery."
Glemsford,Good information provided,3/13/2019,5,Its good to get appointments and I see the one doctor most of the time. Information provided by the doctors is good and things are explained well. Staff are all good and helpful.
Glemsford,Good staff,7/13/2023,4,Everyone is pleasant and helpful and the staff are all pretty good.I feel that it works well to get appointments at the moment as I've called in first thing and had the option of a face to face.  It would be good to be able to get blood test done here more easily.
Glemsford,Good surgery,6/12/2023,4,Its a good surgery but this week I started trying to get an appointment on Monday and have had one today which is Wednesday. It's nothing urgent so nothing to worry about and I would rather those in more need were seen.  I was told on Monday there were no appointments available and to use econsult and that I'd get a response the next day but I didn't so today I called again and was given an appointment with a doctor this morning.  It's just a little frustrating but they are busy.
Glemsford,Good surgery with friendly staff,2/22/2018,5,A good surgery. The staff are friendly and approachable. The whole pathway with the system works from getting an appointment.
Glemsford,"Good, largely positive",11/21/2022,5,Considering the situation I feel they are doing well as I can get seen when needed and it's no problem getting them. At times confidentiality is a concern as you can hear what is being spoken about on the phones.
Glemsford,"Good, no problems getting appointments and staff polite",4/5/2017,4,No problems getting appointments.  There seems to have been a change in how appointments are released which works well. Reception staff have been polite too.
Glemsford,GPs are very good with children - trust them,2/22/2018,4,"Particularly like the GPs, they are very good with the children, completely trust them, very approachable. Good to have the pharmacy on site. Previous nurse was excellent but do find I'm not so confident in their judgement, so I've had to return the next day, and wasting time."
Glemsford,Great doctor,12/21/2018,5,"All been so lovely, the receptionists are so friendly and polite. I've seen the doctor once and she was great, explained everything and didn't make me feel I was wasting their time."
Glemsford,Great service,2/19/2021,5,The entire staff are very supportive. A credit to the NHS
Glemsford,great work on the Flu Jab clinic,10/21/2020,4,"Well run and well thought out, indeed like CLOCKWORK, people coming in from all over the many roads around the surgery"
Glemsford,Has improved,7/13/2023,4,I find coming down to the surgery is the easiest way to get appointments.  I've had call backs and have spoken to the doctor and pharmacist which have both been good and they've addressed the issues.  I've also been given appointments after speaking to the reception team and they've been good too.
Glemsford,Has lost its way.,6/12/2021,1,"I have been a patient at this surgery for more than 30 years. It used to be the best doctors' surgery that I had ever attended. However it has lost its way. Using Covid as an excuse, it is now very difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor. I do not appreciate having to discuss my personal problems with a non-medically trained receptionist who decides whether to allow you to be given an appointment to talk to a doctor. 

You are then required to wait in all morning for a phone call from the doctor, generally a locum who has no knowledge of your medical history. Imagine being a local teenager who needs to see a doctor about what to them is an embarrassing problem. Would you want to have to tell the receptionist (who could be a friend of your parents of the mother of one of your school friends) your problem? With Covid rates in Babergh down to 5 per 100000 I do not think that the pandemic can be used any longer as an excuse for the poor service."
Glemsford,Helpful reception staff,3/13/2019,5,"The reception staff are very good, helpful and accommodating, very patient with people. I've never experienced any issues. The doctor we see has been very supportive and on the ball, really can't fault them and nothing at the surgery needs to improve or change."
Glemsford,"helpful receptionists, caring medical team",1/26/2021,5,the receptionists i feel go the extra mile to help you attain the help you need in these hard times and the medical team always try to find a solution to your medical conditions.
Glemsford,Helpful surgery,12/21/2018,4,"The surgery are very good at fitting you in for appointments. All staff medical and admin are very friendly,  helpful and very approachable. The only slight thing is that there can be a bit of a wait for your appointment. The doctors and nurses were great with our son who has asthma. They are great at keeping an eye on him and the condition is well monitored."
Glemsford,I don't feel listened to,6/18/2019,4,"It can be a wait of 40 minutes or more to get in to see the doctor. Not always feeling as if quality time is given in the surgery, can feel a bit rushed in the doctors room. Reception staff ask more questions than I would like. Nurse practitioner focused on not smoking a bit too much instead of focusing on what I'd come in for - a chest infection."
Glemsford,I have never had any issues with the surgery,3/30/2020,5,I have always been treated with respect and dignity from the staff at Lion Rd surgery. I have never had any issues with either the care I have received nor the advice given.
Glemsford,If urgent normally seen same day,12/21/2018,5,Its difficult to see the doctor of choice but if its urgent and you call first thing you will normally be seen the same day. If its for a more regular issue it is much more difficult. The doctors do come out to get you for your appointment which is a much more personal approach and the receptionists are very helpful. It can be that too much medication is reissued and once they are in your packet/ bag you can't give them back which is a bit of a waste. I do like that there is a separate room to be able to discuss issues with the pharmacist.
Glemsford,Impressed by staff support,8/31/2018,4,To see some doctors means that there is more of a wait than others but the doctor I've been seeing has been so helpful. I have had some issues with the online prescription ordering and wasn't overly impressed with the help and support provided by staff at the time.
Glemsford,Lack of continuity,11/21/2022,4,Phoning at 8am for an appointment is a little bit of an issue for me but once through it's fine and just need to get used to the change in the system.  I have had a lack of continuity with doctors I'm seeing my 5th for the one issue and it seems to be prolonging the issue. The doctors and nurses are really great individually but there are times when I've had to wait 3 weeks to be seen.
Glemsford,Lovely people,10/5/2018,5,I've had excellent treatment from the surgery. You get quick appointments and lovely people at the surgery. Can't fault the service.
Glemsford,Lovely staff and easy to get appointment,2/22/2018,5,"Staff are lovely, if you need it you can get an appointment. The system works well. I mainly see the doctors and have never been unable to get one. For elderly people it might be nice to have chairs nearer to the door, so they don't have to walk so far."
Glemsford,Mainly see nurses,8/8/2022,4,The suregry is good. I mainly see the nurses for appointments and not the doctors but it seems to work for me.
Glemsford,Marvelous,10/5/2018,5,Can get in to see the GP when you want to. Having the pharmacy on site is very useful and the advice has been great. The referrals to other specialist hospitals has been great ad the whole service has been marvelous.
Glemsford,Nice and helpful,6/2/2023,5,"I booked my original appointment in advance but had to rearrange it when I was unwell.  
It was arranged for the next week and wasn't urgent so was fine. Very nice and helpful staff and the reception staff are really understanding. The medical staff are very pleasant and the whole system works well. The pharmacy here works very well too."
Glemsford,No concerns regarding surgery,6/18/2019,4,"I am very content with this surgery. 
I feel well cared for, they also cared well for my late wife.
I do not have any concerns at all."
Glemsford,No health checks,8/8/2022,3,As I had no health conditions I wasn't seen throughout covid. I've now been diagnosed with a condition and if I'd been seen earlier for a review / health check may be the condition would've been picked up sooner.
Glemsford,No problems getting appointments,6/12/2023,4,My appointments with the nurse are pre arranged  and I've been able to see other memebers of the team in under a week. I find that the system works well as I can get appointments as and when needed.  The nurses are super helpful and really lovely.
Glemsford,Not as good,7/13/2023,3,I'm not getting face to face appointments it all seems to be phone calls now.
Glemsford,Not overly friendly,7/13/2023,2,"It's not an overly welcoming practice, staff don't smile when you come in and they see you. Your impression of the service is then affected. There's no recognition that you are even standing there.  It would be nice if there was some way they could let patients know if they are running behind.  The clinical staff both doctor and nurse that we've seen have been lovely so that side of the practice is good."
Glemsford,Not rushed,12/21/2018,3,The time spent waiting in the waiting room has got longer. You do get enough time with the doctor you see and aren't rushed through. Not having good continuity with the doctor mean that for ongoing issues care is affected.  The advice given by different practitioners is fairly consistent which helps. The surgery is very friendly and is very good.
Glemsford,Particularly good nurses,1/13/2019,5,"You can get quick appointments if its urgent, if its not you'll be given an appointment a bit later. The nurses are particularly good, they're flexible in their approach and will come out and talk to you between patients which is great. I've always collected my medication on a certain day, when I last came in I was told that it wasn't ready and that they don't normally prepare it for that day but they always have before. Reception staff are always very good and very helpful. the whole system works very well for us."
Glemsford,Patient nursing staff,6/12/2015,5,The last time I visited the surgery it was because they asked me to attend for a general health check. The appointment was with the practice nurse and she spent time explaining what was happening and why.
Glemsford,Perfect,11/28/2022,4,Perfect this morning. I called and surprisingly only had to wait 8 minutes on the phone and then I was given an appointment with a doctor. In the past the telephone consultations have worked well. I feel it would be better to have the pharmacy more separate to the surgery to help with confidentiality so that you can discuss issues without the waiting room hearing everything.
Glemsford,Perfectly fine,6/12/2023,5,"The waits on the phone are not excessive and when you get through appointments are available, especially with the nurses, who are lovely. I haven't needed to see a GP for over a year now but my husband who does see them regularly has no problems getting seen quickly when we are concerned about something."
Glemsford,Pharmacy and receptionists are good,2/22/2018,5,Pharmacy and receptionists are good. You can get appointments when needed and get through quite quickly. The advice given by the pharmacy is good too. The locums seen recently were nice and well informed on my history. Good to have continuity with locums too.
Glemsford,poor medicines management,11/18/2020,1,"Disinterested attitude, whilst on medication, was given more medication on 2 occasions which when we checked, should NEVER be taken together"
Glemsford,Pretty good most the time,11/21/2022,4,Most of the time I get through to the surgery well and get call backs on the day for the children or us. You do see or speak to different doctors so you do have to repeat what you say. Reception staff are helpful and friendly. I have had some small issues with a swab that was taken being lost and not being sent off for testing which delayed treatment as I only found out 3 weeks later.  The other issue was that because I wasn't initially examined when I first contacted the surgery the correct diagnosis wasn't achieved until I was seen by a different doctor when problems persisted.
Glemsford,Process is difficult,7/13/2023,2,Appointment availability and the process to get appointments is more difficult as you have to wait for a phone call back and because there is no time given it's then difficult to plan. There doesn't seem to be a way to get a quick response when there are issues. Getting medication has been difficult too and I've run out and have had to re request more.  I do feel that there are issues that need to be seen but the process still means that you have to have a phone call and a chat which seems a waste of time.
Glemsford,Quick and easy appointments; Good GPs,2/22/2018,4,If I phone up I can generally get an appointment quite quickly. I have good relationship with the GPs at the surgery. I'm happy to see any GP at the surgery
Glemsford,Quick appointments,2/1/2019,5,"You can get quick appointments if its urgent, if its not you will then be given a later appointment. The nurses are particularly good, they're very flexible in their approach and will come out and talk to you between patients."
Glemsford,"Reassuring support, text reminders are good.",6/18/2019,5,"Helpful receptionists
Pharmacy is very helpful
Nurses gave really good reassurance recently regarding my babies vaccinations.
The text reminder service is good for appointment reminders."
Glemsford,Reception are great,3/18/2019,5,"Happy with the surgery, they are very good. Can be a little tricky at times to get appointments but reception staff are great, friendly and helpful.  Pharmacy staff are excellent, I've run out of medication in the past and they have quickly arranged for it to be available"
Glemsford,Reception do all they can,3/13/2019,4,"I try to stick to the same doctor and it is difficult to get appointments around the buses, reception staff do all they can to book the appointments around them for me which is great."
Glemsford,Reception helpful,8/31/2018,5,"I tend to book appointments by calling the surgery, I can get appointments as and when I need them and I mainly get to see the same GP. I spoke to reception staff today and they advised that I should see a GP rather than a nurse.  The pharmacy is helpful and flexible getting you what you need."
Glemsford,Reception not overly helpful,8/8/2022,3,I've called for appointments but by the time you get through there are no appointments available and the receptionist just tell you to try again tomorrow and offer no real advice or help to speak to someone sooner.
Glemsford,"Rude receptionists, Rude Doctors.",11/1/2021,1,"Receptionists are so rude, they say they will give you a phone consultation but never end up calling, then get in a mood with you on the phone if you ask why, they then blame it on you. Surely a doctor has enough time to make more than one phonecall sat in their office if an A&E doctor and nurse can do a brilliant job whilst working front line. Doctor in particular has no compassion, very sarcastic. It gives me anxiety having to ring and make an appointment as you know it will take a good 3-4 hours out of your day. Not surprised the hospitals in our area are full- if we had a functioning surgery this would not happen."
Glemsford,Seem to be very busy,4/13/2016,5,I called for an appointment and was told nothing was available for two weeks but when I said I had a chest infection I was told I could have an appointment. The service is normally very good.
Glemsford,Seems to be improving,7/4/2016,4,I have waited for up to an hour in the waiting room but this seems to be improving.
Glemsford,Somewhat mixed experience,8/23/2018,3,"Unfortunately, the nurse could not solve my problem. She referred me to a GP who doesn't have a follow up appointment for me until August 28"
Glemsford,Staff are friendly and have time for you,2/22/2018,5,Staff have time for you and getting appointment is easy with staff being very friendly. Not a problem at all with the service provided.
Glemsford,Staff are good,12/21/2018,4,The online services available are very good as are the staff. The last medication review I had was done by phone which was great and saved going to the surgery. In the past it has been a bit difficult to get through on the phone in the mornings.
Glemsford,Staff are lovely,8/31/2018,5,Everything is good at the surgery. The staff are lovely and I can get appointments when needed and I normally call to book which works well.
Glemsford,Staff good,8/31/2018,5,A nice local surgery where you can mostly get appointments when you need them. Staff are very friendly and explain things well. Nothing really needs to change and its great to have the pharmacy on site too.
Glemsford,Staff interaction very good,12/24/2018,4,Waiting times to see a specific doctor can be too long at about a week. Staff interaction is all very good and I'm very happy with how the surgery runs and operates.
Glemsford,Staff not always helpful,11/28/2022,4,Once you have an appointment its fine but reception staff are not always as helpful as they could be and I've had issues with the phones being put down mid conversation. A lot of the new doctors are really good and the phone queue system is a better idea.  The pharmacy staff go out of their way to be helpful.
Glemsford,Staff very good,11/21/2022,4,Rang this morning and got an appointment straight away with a GP.  When calling I have been unable to be heard by reception so have had to call back. Staff have been very good and I'm happy with how it is all working.
Glemsford,Staff very good,11/21/2022,4,Both reception and clinical staff are very good. There's the small issue of the phones being very busy in the morning but as a new patient I've been able to get an appointment when needed. I was slightly concerned when with no explanation my medication wasn't available when needed. All I was told was that it was being reviewed but I wasn't even spoken to about it.  I was then told I could have it but that they couldn't get it. I started asking other pharmacies and was told that I'd just need to ask for a different size to be prescribed as they were available. Would've been helpful if the pharmacy at the surgery had said this as the time this all took meant I went with out the medication for a while.
Glemsford,Staff very good,3/13/2019,4,"Most things are done well, the staff are very good, very friendly and helpful. Registering as a new patient went well. I don't particularly like the on the day system as its not always urgent and I don't always think it appropriate to see the nurse. Repeat prescriptions are normally very good, however, I came in to pick up my normal medications but one of them wasn't there because they said I needed a review. I wasn't made aware of this before I needed the medication and feel I should've been. The pharmacy did sort it all out and I managed to get a review booked for the following week."
Glemsford,Staff very helpful,10/5/2018,5,A very good surgery. Usually I get to see the doctor I like to see. As I travel by bus the receptionists are very helpful and will try to get me an appointment around the time of the bus times which is very helpful. Considering the number of new houses capacity in the future is a concern. It great having the pharmacy on site and I like having the blood pressure monitor in the waiting room. I recently saw the nurse practitioner and she was very good and I'd highly recommend them.
Glemsford,Superb staff and doctors alike.,6/5/2020,5,"I have known this surgery over many years, and have always never found any part of their service to be wanting, I have complete confidence in the treatment and care that I receive from every member of staff, from the front desk and beyond - The NHS at it's very best."
Glemsford,The doctors here are brilliant,6/18/2019,5,"Hartest GP surgery has recently closed and this has caused a great problem for me as I have to come such a way but I cannot fault this surgery, the doctors are brilliant."
Glemsford,The pharmacy service is terrible - dr good,9/2/2021,1,The pharmacy was most unhelpful when medication was lost is in the post - and were reluctant to help    even though it was caused me to be unable to walk - in frustration i swore which gave them the excuse to finish the call - Most unhelpful staff
Glemsford,Told to call back,6/12/2023,3,"I phone early but they are often very busy and you end up 13th in the queue and are then told there are no appointments available and to call back at 12pm when you can then again be told there are no appointments not even for a call back.  Once you do actually get in to see a member of staff they are very good and I'm very happy with the care provided. There's no rush with the doctors and the reception staff are great, there just appears to not be enough appointments for those who need them."
Glemsford,Unhelpful on the phone,8/8/2022,1,"I've found the staff quite rude and unhelpful on the phone. I had previously had cancer and had some blood tests done during covid so was called by doctor with the results but they clearly hadn't read my notes because when I asked if I should be concerned, they said only if you've had cancer! A clear case of notes not being read and quite worrying.  More recently I was sent a letter giving me 10 days notice that I was being removed from their patient list  after being at the practice for years because they said I was outside their practice boundary. There was very little information in the letter."
Glemsford,Very busy phones,6/2/2023,3,"The phones are very busy and when no appointments have been available I've been told to go to A&E for sciatica, on one occasion I was told to ring an ambulance which I don't feel was appropriate.  The kids have been unwell a lot this winter and when appointments for them were not available it was suggested we go to hospital, but I do not drive and it is very difficult to get there when it's not 100% necessary.  I've been happy with the staff when you do get to see them."
Glemsford,Very caring,12/21/2018,5,"Excellent, no problems at all. They are very caring and look after me well. I tend to see the same doctor when possible as its helpful and means they know what's going on."
Glemsford,Very friendly and helpful staff,2/22/2018,5,Very friendly and helpful staff. Very rarely have to wait for an appointment and it's great to have the pharmacy on site. Everything works well and as far as I am concerned nothing needs changing
Glemsford,Very good,9/13/2022,4,"Always had a very good experience with call backs in 1/2 an hour and emergency appointments on the day, which are easier to arrange than more routine issues.  Doctors take time and I saw a lovely nurse today.  I haven't had to wait long on the phone when calling the surgery and have been able to get blood tests with in a couple of days at the surgery but I have had to say I find getting to tests at Sudbury very difficult."
Glemsford,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"It's generally very good but at times there have been lengthy waits for appointments. I've had a mix of face to face and telephone calls back from the doctors. Conversations on the whole have addressed the issues and staff listen and are happy to talk things through.  I'm happy to see any of the GPs and all staff are excellent, friendly and kind, nothing is too much trouble."
Glemsford,Very good,6/2/2023,5,"Appointments have been available when needed and I've been seen quickly. The staff are very good, with lovely doctors and nurses. The main entrance is difficult to get through with the double doors when pushing a wheelchair but staff do come out to help. Having the pharmacy on site is really useful too."
Glemsford,Very good at discussing issues,12/21/2018,5,"The doctors are all very organised, very good at discussing things and really will make sure that you understand whats happening.  I don't tend to use the online booking for appointments as its easier to get appointments that you'd like by calling or visiting the surgery, but I do use it for prescriptions which works well."
Glemsford,Very good doctors,3/13/2019,5,"You can get to see someone when you call in the morning. The doctors are very good and supportive, they will always check things out if you're concerned, they take you seriously. The pharmacy is good, repeat prescriptions are always ready on time."
Glemsford,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,4,"Reception are polite and helpful, if you have a good reception team like here you're on to a winner.  They do all they can to fit you in when you need an appointment, they're so accomodating.   Nurses are really great and the doctors have time for you and I never feel rushed. Staff listen to you are are very friendly."
Glemsford,Very good.,3/2/2017,4,For physical issues the doctors are very good but for emotional issues they aren't so good
Glemsford,Very pleasant staff,12/24/2018,4,You can get an appointment when you need one and normally on the same day. The staff are very pleasant and are good at sorting things out . Medications are available quickly and when there's been an urgent need they have sorted it out quickly.
Glemsford,Very supportive,12/24/2018,5,"They help as much as they can and are very pleasant. The surgery itself is a comfortable environment and not at all intimidating. The staff are very good, accommodating and helpful when sorting things out. It would be nice to have a board showing each member of the staff team and their role. They have been incredibly supportive to our family.  Happy to wait to see my GP, appointments do run behind however, he gives you all the time you need which is great."
Glemsford,Weekend appointment,6/12/2023,3,"Today I had a blood test which easy to arrange but I called the surgery to see a doctor and was offered a phone call but really wanted a face to face appointment.  I was able to get an appointment on a Saturday which was great but in 2 weeks time.  If I'd waited to see my doctor it would've been nearer 6 weeks.  It would've been nice to hear back about my blood test results, I was sort of expecting a call to say all was fine or not but appears you're called only if there's a problem, which can be slightly worrying."
Glemsford,Well run surgery,8/31/2018,5,The surgery is well run and organised and the staff are all very good and friendly.
Glemsford,Wonderful receptionists,10/5/2018,5,You don't feel frightened to call for an appointment. The receptionists are wonderful always have a smile and you can really talk to them. At times the pharmacy can be a bit slow but advice given has been very good. Sometimes too much information is given which can be difficult to take in.
Glemsford,Works very well,3/13/2019,5,"Excellent. The surgery works very well, the doctors, nurses and pharmacy all work smoothly together. I'm happy to see any doctors if urgent but if for a routine ongoing issues I try to see the same doctor if possible. Having the pharmacy on site makes it easier. Overall I'm happy with the surgery."
Glemsford,Works very well,3/13/2019,5,Very prompt at responding and helping and you can get an appointment as and when they are needed which works very well. Very helpful staff and the nurses are lovely and friendly. It always works for me.
Glemsford,Works well,7/13/2023,5,Not been hard to get appointments. I spoke to the doctor this morning and they invited me in for an appointment soon after. The staff are great and I don't feel that anything needs to change.
Glemsford,Works well,11/21/2022,5,It's worked well for me and I'm seeing a very good GP. I spoke to reception and they gave me an appointment to see the doctor which I was very pleased with. It seems that the surgery is improving after losing GP's and reception staff are great.  It would be helpful to have at least one chair with a higher seat and arms in the waiting area to make it easier to get up.
Glemsford,Works well,12/21/2018,5,I'm confident that you can get an appointment when you need one and the staff are very helpful. The doctors are good at explaining things and nothing really needs to change it all works well.
Glemsford,Works well,10/5/2018,5,Easy to get appointments and in general the service works well and meets my needs
Grove,"""You are number 42 in the call queue"".",3/10/2022,4,How on earth are you supposed to get an appointment these days when you have to wait so long on the phone before you can speak to anyone?
Grove,A Call centre!,8/3/2019,3,"I got to see my GP who said 'Hello stranger', and I said the same thing that I was thinking.  They said to me openly that the place is turning into a glorified call centre."
Grove,"A long wait, and lacks help for mental health",10/12/2015,3,A lack of support and help for depression. Put down to me being a teenager and other incidents other than mental health.
Grove,A really good practice,6/9/2016,5,It is a really good practice.  Very nice new facility.  Receptionists are all very good and getting appointments not a problem.  Really helpful and do all they can to fit you in
Grove,Absolute joke.,5/16/2020,2,"Though your staff are very friendly and nice, I’m still trying to collect a prescription that I’ve been trying for two weeks to get. I call to find out where it is, and then it isn’t there. I’ve tried twice to collect it from the surgery, the nurses say it is not there yet when I call just before arrival it is there. I’m still without my prescription and I’m about to need it. I’ve been out 6 separate times during a lockdown to try and get it plus numerous phone calls. They seem a joke now."
Grove,Absolutely faultless care and support.,2/19/2023,5,"I called at approx. 8.30 and was 3rd in the queue. I explained my problems, and also that I was currently in Norwich but would soon be driving home. The Health Care Assistant was so helpful and understanding, and explained if I missed the call, I could have one call back. Meanwhile, I received an e-questionnaire to complete, including photographs of my throat.
I arrived at my destination and Dr called 5 mins later - the timing was perfect! Apparently my questionnaire and photos were very helpful, and with my additional information,  I was given a diagnosis and a prescription. As I wasn't at home, I asked if there was any chance the prescription could be sent to the town where I was, and he said this was no problem. I named a pharmacy,  but Dr noticed it was only open for another hour, so he advised a different one. 
I was so grateful for such caring and supportive help at a very difficult time, and can't praise Dr and the HCA highly enough. Thank you very much indeed."
Grove,Accurate explanation and well looked after,6/7/2018,4,"This surgery always directs me to the right professional for my needs, i.e. GP or practice nurse or blood testing and overseeing my diabetes and hypertension problems."
Grove,All good,1/2/2018,5,I have had no problems at this surgery. All is really good
Grove,All went well,12/13/2021,5,Everything went well at the Covid vaccination clinic.
Grove,All works well for me,8/3/2019,5,Outstanding work by all here.  It works well for me.  I get to see someone on the day when I need to. Do not use it that much so not really got anything other than that to share
Grove,Always been happy,2/11/2022,4,"I have not had cause for any complaint over the years I have been here. When there were challenges, I felt they did well. My most recent appointment was face-to-face on the same day that I rang the surgery. I cannot fault that and it all was resolved."
Grove,Always direct me to the right professional,9/3/2018,4,This surgery always direct me to the right professional for my needs i.e. GP or practice nurse or blood testing and overseeing my diabetes and hypertension problems.
Grove,Always get appointment,8/11/2019,5,I always get an appointment even though waiting on the telephone can be long.  They are very caring.  When we have had a callback it has been that my elderly mum has either not needed to come in or they have kindly given her a home visit.
Grove,"Amazing support by Doctors, Nurses and Admin",4/20/2020,5,"Today I received a feedback on a request of mine for more diazepam.  I then had a triage phone call - they looked after my terminally husband until his death in December 18 and nothing was ever too much trouble.  He talked to me with great sympathy and sorted matters out,  Whilst I said thank you.  'what I mean is a real THANK YOU to my doctor and all of you in the front line.  You are amazing."
Grove,An excellent surgery,12/1/2017,5,An excellent surgery which I can't find any fault with
Grove,Appalling,6/11/2015,1,"Having experienced a recent bout of bronchitis I was still feeling poorly.  I attended the doctors who weren't bothered that I was tearful, tired, dizzy struggling to take deep breaths.  They advised I needed a blood test.  However the dr. wouldn't do it I needed to see a nurse. The nearest appointment I could get was in a week's time.  When I complained I was told I could go to a minor injury clinic which was 15 miles away. I was not able to visit the local one.  I fail to see why the doctor couldn't do it"
Grove,appointment difficulty,1/2/2018,4,"I am in to see the diabetic nurse today who is fabulous, and as it is scheduled it is all good. When I need an appointment on the day for illness this can be much more difficult to get."
Grove,Appointment system makes no sense,8/11/2018,4,Find the appointment system just doesn't make sense to why it is good for patients to call at 8 am.  Do not feel consideration is given to people who would struggle to get up for then.  It is only 'on the day' and if all gone you have to try again the next day at 8 am again the next day.  I would prefer to be able to call and make an appointment for the next day.
Grove,Appointments,1/2/2018,4,It is silly that you cannot book appointments in advance. Where do appointments go when by 8.30am they have all gone when I finally get through on the telephone.
Grove,Appointments a problem,1/2/2018,4,"I do not understand where all the appointments go. 10 minutes after 8am, they are all gone. It makes no sense when the surgery has many doctors."
Grove,Appointments at short notice,6/1/2017,4,I can get appointments at short notice. My condition is being followed up and hospital appointments are promised
Grove,"Appointments difficult, nurses nice",7/24/2017,3,"Booking appointments a nightmare but nurses very nice, they have time for you."
Grove,Appointments hard to get,3/21/2016,4,The new system allows no pre-bookable appointments for doctors. If you ring from 8am it takes ages to get through. It stresses me out trying to keep ringing. Staff are not very kind about it on the other end of the phone.
Grove,Appointments very hard to get,10/11/2017,4,It is rare to be able to get an appointment here.
Grove,Been good since moving here,5/3/2020,4,"Recently moved from Walton surgery, due to imminent closure, and so far things have been fine. Much bigger so I am not sure if I will experience same issues as Walton with access to appointments.  The system here though with the 'callback' is for me an unusual one, but I get why they are doing it.  Just will take a bit of getting used to.  However, so far, I have had my initial appointment and back today for some bloods, which was easy to organise."
Grove,Better experience to last time,2/11/2022,5,"At my smear, they have changed the implement to a plastic one and this is so much better, way more comfortable and took a lot less time.
Another appointment I had was a call back by a GP and this was a thorough conversation, which was good."
Grove,Bit more information,4/17/2023,4,"Newly diabetic and having bloods every couple of months. On some medication now but hope to reverse this with my life changes. Last test said on my text 'no further action,' so I did wonder if that meant I continue as I am or no longer need to take the medication. As I am new to this a bit more information would be good so I know for sure that I am doing the right thing. 
This is language/way of putting something that I am not used to."
Grove,Brilliant,7/3/2021,5,"Very attentive staff - doctors, receptionists, nurses etc. etc.  Looked after my husband through his terminal illness very well and have supported me throughout. Obviously not always plain sailing but nothing ever major."
Grove,"Brilliant at The Grove, Felixstowe",1/16/2021,5,"Just attended for my Covid vaccination and would like to thank all the staff who are doing a fabulous job under extreme circumstances. The weather was also dreadful for the chaps instructing traffic and the ladies having to go outside to Direct and inform patients on what to do.
Everybody was friendly and knew exactly what they were doing.
Well Done the Grove."
Grove,Brilliant Doctor,1/10/2021,5,"Went to the surgery as my son wasn’t very well, met the very lovely Doctor (name removed) , who was very kind and reassuring and actually took the time with me and son, wish all doctors were like this , as I actually came away feeling very relieved and grateful"
Grove,Brilliant service,2/11/2022,5,"We have always had a good service here. Staff are lovely and helpful and we have not had any issues getting what we need, treatment wise, when we need it."
Grove,Call back- need a time,5/3/2020,3,"I really feel there should be some expectation set for a time that you will receive a call back within.  On school runs and working means it is a bit stressful knowing you will get a callback, but not when.  I feel within 2 hours is a reasonable timescale and know of other surgeries that operate like this."
Grove,Call back system is a waste of time,10/5/2016,4,"It is difficult to get an appointment, calling them at 8am & then waiting in to get a call back if they are unsure on reception if you need appointment. They do not give you a time that they will call you back, which causes problems and then if you do need to go in anyway that is twice the amount of time used up by the doctor. It just seems a waste of time. I would not be happy being prescribed medication without seeing the doctor face to face."
Grove,Callback does not work if you work,8/3/2019,4,Call back system is no good for people who are at work and unable to take a call back.  It can then be very difficult to get an appointment
Grove,Callback whatever the issue,5/3/2020,4,I do not like the callback system as you need sometimes to make an appointment in a few weeks when GP requests a follow up.  There surely could be some leeway on this method.  For me it is just frustrating and actually makes no sense.
Grove,Called with an uncontrollable anxiety attack,9/11/2021,5,"I just wish to thank the doctor that helped me today, I’m unsure how to go about doing it these days? I am finally breathing after 72 hours on panic. I have sat down and actually been able to consume a small amount of food. 

From the bottom of my heart 
THANK YOU."
Grove,Calling at 8am is too early for me,10/5/2016,3,"Getting an appointment is difficult as 8am is very early for me to try and get through on the telephone. I have on occasion been able to use the system but they will not allow me to go in the afternoon, which suits me better. Yet I cannot then book for the next day in the afternoon and just tell me I have to call again at 8am. It is very frustrating."
Grove,"Can't fault, marvellous Practice",7/24/2017,5,I cannot fault this surgery.  It's absolutely marvellous.
Grove,Care is brilliant,6/15/2016,2,Once you get through reception the care is brilliant but I don't like being asked why I would like/need an appointment by reception staff
Grove,Challenging getting appointments,8/3/2019,4,It is challenging getting appointments.  The Phlebotomist is brilliant on the whole its a great service and being able to have it at the surgery where there is good parking is very convenient.  Staff are very good and they are all doing their best.
Grove,Change of medication,5/3/2020,4,"Overall the surgery is good.  I have had numerous 'callbacks' over the last few weeks.  Before Xmas though my medication changed (Cardiology related) and a week in to it, it didn't agree with me.  I ended up in an ambulance.  I do not understand why they cannot get staff member to make a call to you a week in when the medication is changed, to see how it is working for you. It would save other issues.  Even if it was the Pharmacy that called (which I actually thought they were supposed to do, but they have never done this for me)."
Grove,Chasing X-ray results,4/17/2023,3,"Getting to see a Doctor is difficult. Also finding having to chase for X-ray results is frustrating. We are told it's to be given through the surgery, but I am waiting to know still."
Grove,Check up timing,4/13/2023,3,"Having had a brain haemorrhage some years ago, the ongoing monitoring has been non-existent. It is strange how you can go for many years and not ever get asked about something that was a major health scare. After 14 years I am having a check-up and I am not even sure what triggered that, but it will be the first time in relation to this."
Grove,Clear explanations,7/24/2017,4,Nurse practitioner explained everything very clearly.
Grove,Communicate when things change,8/11/2018,4,"I can get an appointment usually when need one.  They can run behind a little.  What I would like is a bit more communication when things change. Then 'why', E.G. Prescription discussion's desk, has been moved to upstairs when the Pharmacy is downstairs.  Logistically makes no sense, but sure they have reasons.  Just be good to know."
Grove,Communicated the wrong information,1/2/2018,4,"It is very difficult to get an on the day appointment. I was also upset to be told that the diabetic nurse I had been seeing regularly would not be working here at my next appointment, so an appointment was made with a different nurse. However, this was untrue. I turned up for my appointment and the nurse told me that the other nurse was still there, and had had no plans to go anywhere else. Unsure why I was misinformed. It is nice to have a rapport and for someone to know your history, which is why I would always prefer to see the same nurse."
Grove,Communication problems,9/11/2020,3,"The practice like many others needs to somehow improve communication access. Having to wait on mobile phone with 18 in front on queue is expensive. The ability to book a Dr's appointment, not on day, but in the future seems to be unavailable,"
Grove,Continuity needed,6/24/2022,3,"Telephone calls are alright, but if an ongoing problem, speaking to another GP is not good. I feel that there is need for continuity for phone calls or face to face appointments"
Grove,COVID CLINIC 1.12.21,12/13/2021,5,"Timing and organisation was good. It was friendly , organised and supportive."
Grove,COVID CLINIC 1.12.21,12/13/2021,5,A great team effort. A fantastic and friendly service.
Grove,COVID CLINIC 1.12.21,12/13/2021,5,"Good running, thank you and well done."
Grove,COVID CLINIC 1.12.21,12/13/2021,5,"Parking was easy, staff were friendly, made the wait go quickly. Good information given, nice to see how everything was cleaned down, injection very swift, nurse was talking and all of a sudden the jab had happend. The nurse who jabbed me was swift and kept me distracted. All the staff were friendly, although lots of people being jabbed it did not feel like a production line."
Grove,COVID CLINIC 1.12.21,12/13/2021,5,Everything was efficient. many thanks to all for their hard work.
Grove,COVID CLINIC 1.12.21,12/13/2021,5,Very organised as per previous vaccine appointments
Grove,Delightful staff,11/29/2021,4,"I am always greeted so nicely on the telephone by the staff there. I am sure they have to deal with some challenging situations, but they are always so pleasant when I call. I tend to be around 10th in the queue, but it goes down really quickly in the morning. I am unable to use online systems, but as the telephone works so well for me that does not frustrate me."
Grove,Difficult to book appointments in advance,7/3/2022,1,"It’s interesting that the almost 5* rating is based overwhelmingly on the Grove as a vaccine clinic. But as a GP practice they are incredibly inflexible when it comes to booking appointments. Many of us work long hours and would like to book an appointment in advance even if it means waiting a couple of weeks. I am at work at 8am and cannot spend 30mins on the phone. I was advised by a nhs check to make an appointment to have my pulse checked, nothing serious but worth checking. I phoned at 2.30 and was told to go to the surgery immediately (it could have waited) and to tell my boss it was urgent (it wasn’t) I explained I was self employed and was on my own at work but I was told this was the only option."
Grove,Difficult to see own GP,7/24/2017,3,Difficult to get an appointment with your own GP
Grove,Disparity when you ring later in day,8/11/2019,4,"Surgery overall is excellent. There is however a disparity between calling first thing and if you call later in the day.

- Ringing in the morning.  You wait a little while but it gets answered in a very reasonable amount of time.  Today I was triaged too and have now come in for the appointment.
- Calling later in the day. I called recently at 3pm and it took 1 1/2 hours to have the call answered.  

They did apologise and said they had a lot of calls."
Grove,"Doctors, nurses good. Admin not.",2/13/2021,2,"Saw my doctor all fine, medication given, went to pharmacy one item not available. Went back to surgery, where I was told that the pharmacy had to communicate with the surgery, or i had to go home and make a phone call to surgery to correct the error which they made, how crazy is that? So i went back to the pharmacy and they wrote on a piece of paper explaining that the item needed was no longer in use and to request a different medication. Went back to surgery to give them the note, to which i was told that i should phone and not give them bits of paper with information on. But i insisted the admin lady take it. This is not the first time i have had run ins with the admin staff, they seem to have policies that assume all patients are round pegs that fit in round holes, which as we all know is not the case. They are rude and obnoxious and always quote policies. Common sense goes a long way."
Grove,Don't like the appointments system,5/23/2016,4,I don't like the appointment booking system but the consultations are good when you get there.
Grove,E-Consult staff no knowledge,4/11/2021,4,"I wanted to use E-Consult, but not being familiar with where it is and the in's and outs of it, I rang to ask reception where E-Consult is and a few tips on using it and they just said 'I actually do not know!'"

They were very knowledgeable and really helpful.  This is the NHS at it’s best, thank you very much for a great service"
Grove,Excellent,3/3/2022,5,The delays waiting for a phone to be answered are disappointing but understandable and I am always impressed with the response from everyone who answers the phone as if it was the only call received.

Grove,Excellent service for 2 different conditions.,4/8/2015,5,"On two mornings, a couple of months apart, I telephoned the surgery receptionists for an appointment. On both occasions I had a doctor's telephone call to assess my conditions within 40mins & an appointment at the surgery in the afternoon. I had antibiotics immediately prescribed for an infection & a physiotherapy self assessment referral immediately available.  The infection cleared with the antibiotics & a physiotherapist appointment, to start treatment, materialized in less than two days."
Grove,"Excellent, welcoming.",8/30/2021,5,"With apprehension I attended for my first ever colonoscopy, I did not need to worry. The nurses and doctor were excellent, they made you feel very at ease and comfortable, explained everything and were very reassuring throughout the whole visit, especially while the procedure took place. The whole visit was over and done with in just over an hour, I could not have asked for more. Thank you, you were great."

Grove,fair,12/4/2016,3,Difficulty in seeing the screen in the waiting room due to poor eyesight.  Never seeing the same doctor twice
Grove,fair,12/4/2016,3,"Not seeing your own doctor, you see anyone.  If you ask, your own doctor is full up night and morning.  Can't make an appt. a day or two ahead."
Grove,Fantastic,10/18/2019,5,"Been having problems over the last 18 months or so. Dr’s are making sure I’m see who I need to at the hospital and listening to me, which for my condition is half the battle."
Grove,First class,11/29/2021,5,"We moved here from Essex earlier this year, and this service has been impeccable.

Grove,Flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"Reception, guidance, directions excellent attitudes from all, so a big thanks to you all!"
Grove,flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"Everything associated with the injection was excellent, we would just suggest better signage so indicate where the entrance is, as it is not the main entrance of the surgery, as we had expected. When we raised this however, they sorted it straight away."
Grove,flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,The timing was amazing. My appointment was at 14.09 and we were finished by 14.14!  There was a slight delay in the entrance area as there were a number of less able needing a seat whilst waiting a bit.
Grove,flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"Very well organised, staff all worked really well as a team and they did a wonderful job of meet and greet, spoke clearly and repeated things clearly without shouting. Keep up the good work!"

Grove,Flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"Very efficient and well organised. We had a good timely reminder. We did not get any information about the flu vaccine and possible side affects, which we would have liked, and sure we have had before.  The staff were friendly and we appreciate their efforts"
Grove,Flu Clinic,12/24/2021,5,"We came early but went straight in and the queue was not a long one at all, as we thought it may be. We want to say to the staff 'these are even harder times than usual, but keep up the good work. It is very much appreciated thank you!"

Grove,Flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"Everything was fine, couldn't be better as it was so well organised and all the staff were very friendly and helpful, thank you!"
Grove,Flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"Every thing went well at the appointment. I was early, parked up and welcomed by everyone on site. They were all very pleasant.

Grove,Flu clinic,12/24/2021,5,"The service was excellent, military precision from the queuing to the parking. All delivered with a smile from the staff. Thank you"
Grove,Flu clinic,1/10/2021,4,Everything went well at the appointment but as a wheelchair user the signage could have been better as you park near the main entrance when you were entering at the rear.
Grove,Flu clinic,1/10/2021,5,"It was so well organised by the staff, but people were turning up not at their appointment times, which throws things out. The staff cannot control that and I felt for them, but they continued to be so help and friendly."
Grove,Flu clinic,1/10/2021,5,I would like to express my gratitude to the staff for the long hours the staff have worked and yet they are still being pleasant and cheerful. Thank you

Grove,flu clinic - Still queued,9/16/2021,5,"Although I had a timed appointment there was queuing, which is ok in the sunshine, but less so if it was raining.  The Nurse was very gentle and efficient. Thank you for all you've done since beginning of the pandemic"
Grove,Flu clinic- Blessed,9/16/2021,5,"Well done, I am blessed to be at this surgery. Only thing on this occasion was that we had a timed appointment but still stood in a queue.  The staff were very kind and the parking volunteers too."

Grove,Flu clinic- friendly staff,1/10/2021,5,"The nurse was very friendly, but so was everyone and all so helpful on the visit. It was a bit busy as people arrived clearly ahead of their slot, and we were one of the first for the day. Good amount of parking always helps though."

Grove,Flu clinic- infection control,9/17/2021,4,"It was really well organised and all the staff were very welcoming and pleasant. My only concern was that there was the infection control. They had gloves on, which were not changed between patients, so not sure what the point of them was. I would have thought hand gel would be used between patients, but it was not."
Grove,Flu clinic- Lovely people,9/16/2021,5,The venue was well organised. It was really good to get the phone call invitation followed by the reminder by text. Really lovely people.

Grove,For me different perspective helps,4/25/2023,5,"I have been looked after very well. In the past I had ringback from a GP where I was told I had a chest infection without seeing me, however 3 weeks on I was still not great and saw a locum face to face, which I was dubious about. They saw me from a different perspective and asked me different questions to what I had been asked before. 
As a result a diagnosis was found and referral to hospital to confirm. This was quite a big  issue.
This now means I am quite happy to see different people, as I feel you get a rounded approach from them."
Grove,Friendly staff,12/13/2021,5,Everything went smoothly and staff were fantastic and friendly.
Grove,Frustration on the 'phone,5/3/2020,4,"I get slightly frustrated on the telephone in the morning, then you get put on a call back list, which can happen as late as 4pm.  I have been driving when my 'phone rings, which obviously I cannot answer, then I have missed the first call.  They do sometimes try again, but again you just wait and wait and never know a time."
Grove,Generally good,2/11/2022,5,"I have an ongoing issue and the service has been good overall. If anything could be improved, it would be time it takes to get through on the telephone. It is a big problem. My last appointment thankfully was with a GP and I hope to see the same one with this ongoing issue. I accessed this on the same day of ringing in and getting through after a long wait."
Grove,Generally very good.,4/24/2023,4,"I work full time and it does get frustrating when I am unable to fill the form in over the weekend or before work starts at 8.30am. Today the form isn't open until 12pm. I will have to wait until I finish work at 4pm to complete it.  Phoning up isn't an option when you work as the queue is always so long.
When I am able to fill in the form, the service I get from the surgery is really good."
Grove,Good,7/3/2019,4,Had follow up appointment at Ipswich hospital (cardiac) and was told that GP would make contact about a change of medication.  Receptionist at practice phoned to say the GP would call in 2 weeks.
Grove,Good,7/3/2019,4,Very good but appointments could be easier
Grove,Good,7/3/2019,4,Overall I have no complaints.  Today I am here for an appointment that they contacted me to have.  If I need one on the day the ring back service is not so good for me
Grove,Good,7/3/2019,4,"It is open for people that work funny hours, lorry drivers, port workers etc. Helpful"
Grove,Good,7/3/2019,4,Getting appointments (ring up at 8.00 am) for a new urgent appointment
Grove,Good - Appreciate being given a time for call back,12/10/2016,4,"I appreciate that when given a call back I was also given a time to expect the call, but in the morning it is hard to get through on the phone in the first place."
Grove,good car park facilities,12/13/2021,5,Everything from car parking to treatment went well.
Grove,Good communication,4/13/2023,5,"I feel this surgery has improved somewhat lately.
The communication with me is excellent. It is not difficult to get through on the telephone and you see someone if you need to on the same day. The text reminders are really good, as you could get caught up in your day and forget, especially if something is made in advance, such as my blood tests."
Grove,Good Practice,7/24/2017,4,A good practice for my family.  When we had an issue the team took it seriously and it was dealt with really promptly.
Grove,Good surgery,8/11/2018,5,I do not come to the surgery very often.  Most of the time I find I see the Nurse practitioner which has always proven to be appropriate.  On one occasion when I needed a referral for an X-ray she told the GP it was urgent and so I did get the referral very quickly.  Seen and sorted now.  Have had a couple of occasions where reception have been a bit rude to me.
Grove,Good surgery,5/23/2016,5,This is a very good surgery and this dementia awareness event has been very useful
Grove,Good surgery,5/23/2016,4,This is a good surgery.
Grove,Good throughout,2/11/2022,5,"I personally use the telephone and I have found the team from Receptionist to the medical professionals, polite and they try to be of service as soon as possible. My last appointment was on the telephone with a GP who was able to resolve my issue. I do not mind telephone appointments when face-to-face is not needed."
Grove,good with problems,6/14/2016,4,"Getting an appt. with ""your"" GP is impossible. Transfer of care is fine but disconcerting for my elderly husband.  sometimes cannot get a today appointment - have to call back next day.  Urgent care is great with a wait"
Grove,good with problems,6/14/2016,4,I have waited 1 hour to be seen by a nurse.  Unable to book an appointment in advance
Grove,good with some problems,6/14/2016,4,"Not possible to book GP appointments in advance.  Call on the day then a GP calls back later, but not at a specific time, which means waiting by the phone for an indeterminate time.  Staff generally friendly and helpful.  I have occasionally experienced some abrupt behaviour"
Grove,Got an appointment on the day!,7/5/2022,5,"Really happy with my surgery, called on the day - polite reception staff, triage system worked well. Spoke to a lovely doctor - really made me feel like he listened."
Grove,great at the Vaccine Clinic,7/15/2021,5,"Two vaccinators in particuar were brilliant at the vaccine clinic, calm, professional and so friendly. They deserve the shoutout :)."
Grove,Great for the family,8/11/2019,5,"I have had ongoing viral issues and they are very good at seeing me.  Great when it comes to the kids too.  Just difficult when GP asks for you to come back in a few weeks to remember that, as you have to call 'on the day for that. 
Just wonder if a note could be put no the system and you get a text reminding you to call in."
Grove,"Great, friendly service",7/6/2022,5,Triage system worked well. Medication sorted the same day
Grove,Happy staff is good to see,12/13/2021,5,The clinic was smooth and efficient. The staff were pleasant and smiley.
Grove,Happy with the service,8/3/2019,5,Happy with the service.  Staff attitudes are good and can even have a bit of a joke with staff.  Able to be adaptable with booking appointments would be my only wish.
Grove,Hard of hearing,12/24/2021,4,"Due to hard of hearing it is not always clear to hear and understand communication with a doctor on a telephone call back, particularly if doctor has an accent"
Grove,Having a call back is an issue,7/24/2017,3,"The ring back is a problem. If I am at work and getting a callback, I do not always have a signal so can miss it.  Then they say I have missed my slot."
Grove,Highly recommend,12/26/2020,5,"Cannot fault the surgery at all. Grove have been amazing, they've been very attentive when ive had to go in for an appointment & are always helpful & supportive."
Grove,I can’t begin to thank the Grove team enough,4/3/2022,5,"Nothing is too much trouble, friendly, supportive, helpful, caring and never making me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed"
Grove,In consistent messages,8/11/2018,3,"Husband was far too unwell to get himself to the surgery with his chronic long term condition (respiratory related) No home visit was offered, they said they could not do that.  So we made an appointment for later in the day, in the hope he would feel a bit better. However 15 minutes before the appointment he still was too unwell to move far and so I called 111.  They organised for a GP to see him within 2 hours, who was excellent.  Not sure if that GP was from The Grove or not.  I just feel that if there is a 'Doctor on call' that the 111 service called upon, possibly shared by all the local surgeries (speculating as I do not know if this is the case), then the reception team should have been able to add him to that list.  It is inconsistent and very far from 'working together'."
Grove,Information day was useful,5/23/2016,4,The new practice is very good and I found the dementia awareness information day very informative and helpful.
Grove,Issues not resolved,2/11/2022,3,"I always phone the surgery (I do not do online). The wait is not too bad. My appointment was the next day, but this was by telephone by the GP. They still have not resolved my issues and I would like to 'see' them, as I prefer that and they can see then who you are and how you are really feeling. The telephone is impersonal and less conversational."
Grove,Lack of help,10/12/2015,3,A lack of support or help with mental health- was told it was me being a teenager and external circumstances.
Grove,Lengthy wait on phone,2/11/2022,4,"My last appointment I called in as I find access to appointments via the online system quite complex with no obvious links to any kind of navigation. However, when you use the telephone the wait is lengthy, even when you are number 1 in the queue, which is frustrating. My appointment was a call back and that took a week to get from my initial call. However, the Nurse Practitioner did resolve my issue, so that was appropriate."
Grove,Lifts a bit strange,11/29/2021,4,"I needed to use the lift but they are not very easy to navigate. Someone helped me to go up, but on way down I was told to press the 'G' but could not see that. (This was the button inside the lift when the patient was struggling to see the button on the outside of the lift.  My appointment went well and I was given a referral to the hospital as they cannot deal with it here."
Grove,Lost in the system for a year,10/11/2016,3,"Since experiencing severe initially abdominal pains which were investigated for a number of years and eventually in August 2016 it was determined that there was a back issue rather than gastro issue. From then the doctors have not done anything after receiving a letter from Addenbrookes stating 'in my opinion it is a back issue'. The doctors just issue more and more pain killers. When I experienced a trapped nerve problem I was given physio at Felixstowe General. When I gave her my background history and told them about my letter from Addenbrookes and she had assumed I was under a back and neck specialist but I was not as they had thought it was abdominal issues. She then got me an appointment with the back and neck specialist who I am now seeing today.
I was under gastro for 8 years and feel that there was a real lack of understanding and feel I could have been treated earlier for back issues if listened to rather being fobbed off."
Grove,Nice people,5/23/2016,5,The staff always follow up on things and they are nice people.
Grove,No advanced appointments,1/2/2018,5,Always can get appointment when I can get through in the morning on the day. I do not think they do 'advanced' appointments which would be good for 'check up's'.
Grove,No issues,4/13/2023,5,"With my hearing loss, my aids work well so that currently I have no issues. With no hearing in one ear the better ears 'aid' transmits to the other which makes the sound seem central.  You do have to concentrate on the screen to know you are being called as the 'beep' isn't very loud. Thankfully they run pretty much on time, so you don't need to be looking too long."
Grove,No problems,8/11/2018,4,I find the surgery very good.  It is welcoming and clean.  I have been here for two years and had no problems with it.
Grove,No real issues,10/11/2017,4,I do not need the surgery very often. On the rare ocassion that I have needed an appointment I have managed to get one.
Grove,Not able to get appointments,5/14/2022,1,"No online appointments
Call queuing 17 plus every time I have called
Receptionist rude
Doctor called back eventually and spent no time understanding my issue - just prescribed antibiotics without fully understanding or dealing with my problem"
Grove,Not always informed on patient details,3/4/2019,3,"With my on going condition seeing a regular GP would be good. On one occasion when I had a phone call with a GP that had not seen me before he said ""so how do you know you have...?"". I said they should look at my diagnosis notes from (year) and call me back later. The GP did call later and said ""yes, you do have...""."
Grove,Now used to the new appointment system,8/11/2019,4,"I am now used to the appointment system.  You do no know where you will get a call back, but in my experience it has always been within and hour fo my initial call.  So you do have to not be doing anything our of the house in that time.
Staff are welcoming and seem happy bunch on reception"
Grove,"Nurses really, really good.",5/23/2016,4,"They always try to get you to see a nurse these days. The nurses are really, really good but I sometimes feel fobbed off. I don't know how they can change this perception."
Grove,On-line access,7/11/2020,4,"This isn't a moan or a complaint. However the SystemOnLine log-in button could helpfully be moved to the top of the screen - you have to trawl through the website to find it. I even missed it altogether first time through. If it's the objective to encourage patients to use on-line services more, then the button is in entirely the wrong place."
Grove,Only seen same GP once in 2 years,8/3/2019,4,"Been under this surgery for some time now.  Only seen my own GP once in 2 years.  I am fine with seeing just anyone if it is a 'on the day' need, but with ongoing conditions and prescription related issues I like to see my own GP"
Grove,Overall a very nice place,10/5/2016,4,"With it being new, you expect it to be clean and it is. I just get frustrated about how long it takes to get an appointment. With a Mental Health condition I do feel stressed trying to get an appointment as I need one and cannot predict when that is."
Grove,Overall excellent,8/11/2019,5,Overall all is excellent. Can sometimes be difficult to book if told that you need to be in two weeks.
Grove,Overall good,9/23/2022,5,20 minute wait today for appointment.  My only recent issue was when I called in for an appointment and the answerphone said the surgery was closed for staff training & to call 999 or 111 but no local place to go.
Grove,Particularly caring and supportive,3/4/2019,5,Really looked after me during my on going treatment at the hospital. The nurse practitioner always makes time for me to listen and give reassurance when needed. With on going treatment for cancer I find this surgery particularly caring and supportive.
Grove,Patient confidentiality,1/2/2018,4,Sitting in the waiting area I can hear reception talking to a person standing there and reading out their mobile phone number that they say they have on record. They had asked if they wish to have a text reminder for the appointment. They then state the date and time to the person. This for me breaks patient confidentiality. They need to be aware how their voice carries. They could just write it down instead. I am not even sitting that close to the desk.
Grove,Phone booking service works very well,9/3/2018,5,A phone booking service that works very well.
Grove,Phone booking works very well,6/7/2018,5,A phone booking service that works very well.
Grove,Place has become a joke,8/20/2019,1,Nothing like seeing a doctor with depression saying you feel like driving your car into a brick wall and being told don’t do that you might break a leg nice one
Grove,Poor,9/30/2019,2,Cannot make an appointments in advance.  Got some help but seems impossible to get appt. with a GP
Grove,POOR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY TOWARDS PATIENTS,5/10/2020,1,"Arrived for scheduled appointment at Flu clinic 3rd October.  It was raining heavily, the doors were locked and there was no one visible inside the clinic, so I knocked at the door.  Eventually a woman came and opened the door, and she angrily stated that she and her entire staff were having their 'tea break' and I should not be there yet.  I protested, saying I had a flu jab appointment, she insisted I was 'too early' and said loudly that I had been 'rude'.  
I was able to get in and did obtain my jab.  The overall experience was dreadful.  I was made to feel unwanted, unwelcome and as secondary to the Admin Staff's comfort.  I want to say that the Doctors and Nurses at this practice are all absolutely lovely and caring.  I will put forth that they are completely unaware of the behaviour of administration.  Since COVID, the admin staff have become increasingly unwelcoming and make it clear by body language, tone of voice, and their abrupt way of 'getting rid of' patients, as though the patient was 'in the way', that our Grove Surgery has become an unpleasant place to go.  We, as patients, have no recourse other than to go through the gauntlet of unwelcoming clerical staff, and it hurts people.  It hurts to feel unwanted, unwelcomed and resented by the staff.  It is keeping some patients away from the clinic, as they don't want this treatment.  When you are sick, elderly, unwell in any way, to be treated cruelly makes it all that much worse.  This policy of Administration First, Patient Last, needs to be turned around.  We must prioritize our patient care; that is what our NHS is all about.  Again, I have very high praise indeed for the clinical staff.  If only the admin staff would follow suit."
Grove,Poor communication,6/28/2018,2,"Short of breath, I turned up at the surgery as I was nearby.  They would not give me an appointment there and then and said I had to go home and wait for ring back,  By the time I got home (10 minute journey) I had a missed call on my landline and mobile.  I called them again and they said I had missed my slot.  After a little bit of a conversation around the fact that it takes me 10 minutes to get home and they rang me in 5 minutes.  They then booked an appointment but it was with a male when I had asked for a female"
Grove,Poor patient service,12/17/2015,1,"I am receiving a number of comments/complaints about service offered at the surgery due to number/lack of GP's and number of patients (over 14000). Long delays in getting appointments, staff not helpful due to pressure of work. I would add this is not my surgery. GP Federation offering after hours surgery?? Covering what areas??"
Grove,Proactive and caring,10/4/2019,5,I am so grateful to this surgery for taking the initiative in reviewing my blood levels and discovering a serious condition.  Hopefully early and hopefully whilst better able to treat.  In even the smallest operation the attitude is professional and caring. This morning I had a routine blood test and blood pressure check and the level of concern and attention were superlative.
Grove,Process for booking appt. isn't good,7/24/2017,3,It is not easy to get an appointment with your own GP. And it is not acceptable to be asked by reception what your problem is.  It is not acceptable to have to wait for a GP to call you back.
Grove,Really good here,8/3/2019,5,I find things really good here.  Get appointment when need one.  Have had triage with the GP and ended up coming in later which for me is good.
Grove,really kind staff,5/29/2023,5,i haven’t been registered at the grove for too long but the kindness of the staff has been a refreshing change to my previous surgery. They always appear happy and look like they are enjoying their work.
Grove,Receptionists rude and unhelpful,9/13/2021,2,Doctor told me to phone up to follow up appointment Friday but receptionist said no appointments. Phoned on Monday only to be 28 in the queue. All I want to know is what to do regarding my tablets? Is it to much to ask for a Doctor to phone up and advice their patient.
Grove,Repeat perscription,3/4/2019,5,"One problem - my wife was ill in bed and needed a repeat prescription. The doctor told her to come in, when she was given a repeat. Surely this could be done without her coming in."
Grove,"Right help, eventually",2/11/2022,5,"After talking to reception I saw a Nurse Practitioner twice before then seeing a GP who was then able to help me with what I had seen the NP for. It seemed very long winded and two unnecessary appointments that could have been given to someone else if I had seen the GP in the first place. Things just take longer to get to the bottom of when do not see the right person first time.  The service is excellent and they are thorough, which is why I rate them highly. It just is a little frustrating and I feel they need to train staff better to ensure they get you to the right person first time"
Grove,Rude obnoxious reception lady,4/15/2019,1,"lady on the prescription desk, very patronising and accused me of requesting for the wrong after I had told her what the form was being used for? how would I ask for the wrong form when I don't know what form I need??? very rude...."
Grove,Same doctor would be nice,8/3/2019,4,Would be good to see same Doctor during time when you have an ongoing issue.  Seeing different ones each time presents challenges as there is less time to talk about 'what next' when you have to spend a lot of time explaining what has already happened.
Grove,Saw a GP,2/11/2022,5,"On this occasion I saw a GP, but usually you get a call back and discussion. If the issue is resolved that is fine, but we do miss the opportunity to speak to a GP, as it has not been a GP that calls back, in our experience. Getting through to the surgery is challenging with long wait times. I do use online systems, but they only work for certain conditions/complaints"
Grove,Seeing same person helps,2/11/2022,4,"On calling the surgery I had a callback appointment by a GP I had not spoken to before. They did not know me well. I was given different Meds that turned out to be wrong and they increased my chronic issue. When I had my last 'flare up' I had a very supportive GP (not the same one as before) who I saw face to face 3 days in a row and they were brilliant. It helped me so much as I felt more confident in them and their awareness of my issues. What really was good for me, was that I did not have to keep explaining myself. Seeing the same person does make so much difference to how you feel."
Grove,Seem more settled,8/3/2019,3,Good to get same day appointment.  Surgery is a nice modern building.  GP's now seem settled after a few changes over the year
Grove,seems good to me,5/29/2023,5,i have not had negative experiences with the staff or surgery. i’ve attended for covid vaccines and the organisation has always been great.
Grove,Service is good,2/11/2022,5,"I have found all the treatment etc really good. The only issue I have, is the waiting to get through first thing in the morning. I realise there are a lot of people ringing in, it is just difficult when you have other commitments, which can mean you have to hang up and try the next day. I have used the online system, which is ok, but is rather lengthy too. My last appointment was a ring back on the same day that I had put something in online, so that was a quick response, which was really good."
Grove,Some poor communication but GP's empathetic,7/24/2017,2,"Disappointed at process of referrals to hospital.  Miscommunication about some checkups (eg prescriptions, diabetes side effects). Problems with process of referral for child.
Continuous difficulty in getting prompt prescriptions. 
But GP's are brilliant, so empathetic."
Grove,Sometimes there is a wait when telephoning bu,6/4/2021,5,"After an initial phone call I was contacted by a Nurse Practitioner who discussed my issue in detail, explained what she would prescribe and advised if the issue continued, not to hesitate to contact the surgery again.  A few hours later I called at the Pharmacy and the prescription was available."
Grove,Staff are excellent,8/3/2019,5,Staff here are excellent.  Both here and at Ipswich hospitals as I am having Chemo for Lymphoma.  The care and attention is 100% from both the surgery and the hospital.
Grove,Staff are good with you,12/1/2017,5,A bit impersonal but the services are very good and staff are good with you
Grove,Staff are lovely but...hard to get appointments,10/11/2017,3,"I cannot fault the staff here. they are lovely....when you get to see them. It is really difficult getting an appointment, and surely only going to get worse with all the new houses going up."
Grove,Staff very nice,12/13/2021,5,All went well at the vaccination clinic today. All the staff are always nice.
Grove,Such a nice welcome,9/27/2021,5,"We have recently moved to the area and registered with the practice. We’ve also been able to book flu jabs. So far everyone we’ve interacted with has been really pleasant, helpful and kind."
Grove,Super slick vaccine roll out,12/15/2021,5,"I have had all three of my Pfizer Covid-19 vaccinations at the Grove Medical Centre in Felixstowe. 
The service has been incredibly well organised. The practice staff, both clinical and clerical, supported by a team of enthusiastic volunteers, both in the surgery and the car park, have clearly worked hard to offer a fast and efficient service under extreme pressures over the covid-19 period. If all regions in the UK had access to their expertise, enthusiasm and commitment, the vaccine roll out would no doubt be even more impressive than it already appears to be.
I feel lucky to live in this area and proud that this is my surgery.
Thank you all!"
Grove,Telephone service response poor,4/2/2021,4,3 consecutive days tried to contact surgery to make an appointment. On each occasion experience took over 20 mins with queuing up to  20 calls waiting. clearly the system needs more resource capacity.
Grove,Text reminders,4/13/2023,5,"They contact me for the Phlebotomy service as I have regular blood tests. It is really helpful that they are booked ahead and that you get texts for reminding you. I never need to chase them up, they contact me, and this is really good."
Grove,The best customer care in all my years,10/13/2020,5,Doctors and Receptionists are all first class
Grove,The GP's are not friendly or co-operative.,9/9/2020,1,"It comes across that they are always too busy for you. They do not co-operate with other health professionals. Working with other organisations could help the patient and them, but they don't seem to want to work with others. They border on rude to you"
Grove,The Grove is excellent as a vaccination hub.,3/16/2021,4,"I do feel that other parts of the service are suffering because of the Vaccination Centre.  It is harder to get an appointment for regular injections such as B12 and INR blood tests. Also I was told that proper asthma reviews have been suspended at the moment.  We are constantly being reminded that NHS is still there for other conditions but feel we can't ask because of the pressure everyone is under due to Covid pandemic.
The Grove and previously as Central surgery have always been very supportive in emergency situations though."
Grove,The link to order prescription online doesnt,1/23/2022,1,"The new website does not appear to support online prescription ordering, or am I not using it properly. Also how do I now access my patient record? Thankyou."
Grove,The staff  are doing their best,12/29/2020,5,"The staff doctors and nurses are doing their best in very difficult times,they are helpful,friendly and understanding."
Grove,Told to 'google it',3/4/2019,3,"Partner called for x-ray results. Reception told him what it was (quite a long term she could not pronounce easily). He asked to see the GP to discuss it and was told to ""google it"""
Grove,Tone of 'call',4/17/2023,5,Not used often. In for the first time in a year today. I have hearing aids and do not hear all that well. (The patient then did not hear the beep on the screen. The Nurse came out to call them through).
Grove,Top notch service,7/5/2021,5,"Always very efficient, friendly and helpful. Organisation during Covid has been outstanding."
Grove,totally disinterested.,12/5/2023,1,"contacted surgery on two occasions and spoke to nurse practioner - felt ""fobbed off"",as wouldn't be put in contact with doctor.Third attempt, saw doctor and RUSHED to hospital for operation!!!."
Grove,Totally ignored by all 3 receptionists.,8/20/2021,1,Not one of the receptionists acknowledged me or had the curtesy to say they would be with me shortly. I watched patients coming into the surgery and treated the same. Rude and unwelcoming
Grove,Triage on telephone,8/11/2018,4,"Very difficult to get an appointment here.  The triage system on the telephone, for me just is inappropriate.  I feel you cannot diagnose people without seeing them properly."
Grove,Trouble getting prescription review,1/31/2018,4,"This surgery is really lovely overall. We are however, having real trouble trying to see a GP to explain to my wife about her medication since a diagnosis. She is very worried about if all and we need to know what each thing is for, for insurance purposes. We called the specialist at Ipswich hospital that we originally received the diagnosis from and the secretary told us we would get a call back. That is now 4 weeks ago.
(Signpost made)"
Grove,Upset when system changed,8/3/2019,4,Changing the system of not seeing Doctor we have seen for years.  Very upsetting.  Lack of understanding by person(s) who instigated this system.  Reception staff are good
Grove,Use system online,11/29/2021,4,"I use the 'System online', so get prescriptions and book blood test with Nurses. I have no issues with it and have used it oro about 4 years now. I was unaware of E-Consult, and it is confusing if this is a separate system to system online."
Grove,varies in consistency,8/17/2021,4,"I had a call back, which works ok for me as my work make those allowances, so I can answer my mobile at work.  The consistency of service between professionals varies. Some do make time for you and others just do not. I do not mind the ring backs, but seeing someone face to face should happen if examinations are needed in my opinion"
Grove,"Very Friendly, efficient, and helpful.",6/8/2021,5,"Easy to navigate, very helpful staff, kind and friendly"
Grove,"very good service,",3/24/2016,4,"been patient for around 18 mnts, always managed to get an apt when needed. Staff seem well versed on health matters when asked. Nurses are lovely and calming."
Grove,Very helpful,7/11/2018,4,Very helpful GP.  Quick to respond.  Looked after me well.  Good outcome.
Grove,"Very poor website, long phone wait",8/19/2021,2,"It takes on average around 10 minutes to get through and talk to someone at the Grove, on one occasion I was on hold for half an hour (and this before Covid-19).

The website is one of the worse I've come across and has the look and feel of something that was designed in the 90's.  The pages have far too much content which makes it difficult to find the information you need.  There is no online booking facility, something I know most practices now have and as an IT professional, know exists. 

All I want to do, is book a repeat blood test and I've been writing this review whilst waiting on hold - it's now 15 minutes."
Grove,very positive experience,5/23/2016,4,Telephone consultation on March 16th. I came in and booked a telephone consultation. This was a very positive experience and the after care was good as well.
Grove,Very Understanding,9/21/2018,4,They have been really good-whenever I have needed them they have been very understanding and helpful
Grove,Waiting 3 wks for scan results,7/24/2017,4,"Had to wait 3 weeks for the surgery to give me the results of an ultrasound scan that was done at the surgery.
A telephone appointment was made to talk to the doctor about the result."
Grove,Waiting too long on the phone- 20 people in queue,3/12/2020,2,"Too long wait -20  plus in queue. Mum's anxiety increased, so added to this as I am having to step in to help her. When I called there were 16 in the queue, and I gave up as 10 mins later there were still 13 in queue; I have tried to register her with online booking but I would need to do this as she is not confident with computer access.
Increasing marginalisation of elderly."
Grove,We access this easily,11/29/2021,5,"We use the telephone to call in when we need to.  Often a GP rings back the same day, which is convenient for us. I would use the online system, if I was more than 10 in the queue, but often we do not have to wait long. All staff are very pleasant and we know they have to deal with so much at moment with flu/covid/booster vaccinations, so we appreciate how responsive they are still."
Grove,Well equipped,2/11/2022,5,I have always felt the surgery to be well equipped for most things and very good to be with. My last appointment was with my own GP by telephone on the same day that I had rang the surgery and they were able to help me with my issue. Medication prescribed accordingly and follow-up in a few weeks to check in on me.
Grove,Well organised,2/11/2022,5,The surgery is well organised when it comes to accessing the flu and Covid jabs. Sometimes appointments are hard to get which can be frustrating. My last one was a face-to-face one with a Nurse after I rang the day before and had the time to wait on the telephone that morning.
Grove,Well organised,12/13/2021,5,The clinic was quick and well organised.
Grove,Well organised and run.,9/16/2021,5,Excellent care providers for me and my family. Very thorough and efficient.
Grove,Will be moving surgeries...,10/21/2021,1,"I`ve tried 4 times this week to book an appointment, held on for 25 minutes, I was too late, 2nd time called earlier held on for 20 mintues told I was too late but to use econsult, used e consult advised to call surgery for an appointment! Got an appointment but now told I have to book a blood test, waited another 40 minutes on the phone!! Awful service even in these current times."
Grove,Wish more flexibility for appointments,7/24/2017,4,"Wish that appointments could be obtained in advance, instead of on the day."
Grove,Works well for me,8/3/2019,4,"The surgery works well for me.
I do not mind that I do not see my own GP as I do not have any major issues.  If I did I would hope I could see the same person each time about it."
Grove,Would prefer to see my named GP,7/24/2017,4,"Missed diagnosis of coeliac disease (historic - diagnosed May 2016)  Hardly ever get to see my own doctor.  Last appointment on same day, but not with my GP"
Guildhall,4 star,7/10/2015,4,4 star
Guildhall,A bit hit and  miss,7/19/2023,4,"When trying to get appointments it can be a little hit and miss and I have had issues getting medications on time and have been without pain medication for two weeks. There seems to be an internal issue transferring the prescription across to the pharmacy.  I called three times and then visited the surgery to get the issue addressed.  I've also had a three week wait to see a GP, it appears there is a lack of appointments."
Guildhall,A busy practice,7/14/2022,4,"I've seen the diabetic nurse today who is great. The appointment was easy to arrange but to see a specific doctor it can take more time as they are very busy. Overall though, I'm happy with the care and support I receive from the practice."
Guildhall,"A good surgery, never had a problem",2/22/2018,5,"I never had a problem at the surgery. Surgery staff are lovely, friendly and happy to explain things. Very quick to answer the phone. A good surgery."
Guildhall,Always good,6/18/2016,5,"I don't go that frequently but whenever 	 do they are always good"
Guildhall,Always so very helpful!,7/29/2019,5,"Every member of staff, whether they are a receptionist, a doctor, or a nurse, is always polite, friendly and professional - couldn't ask for a better surgery!"
Guildhall,Awful,7/11/2015,1,I've witnessed an elderly chap come in and ask for advice on behalf of his wife (who was in severe pain due to kidney stones) they asked him to sit down and then I saw staff pull faces at each other and slag him off. Tutting and raising their eyebrows!!! Let's the whole place down.
Guildhall,Can be a wait.,9/2/2017,5,Happy with the surgery.  I very rarely visit but I do I get to see a doctor when I need to but on one occasion it was 4 weeks
Guildhall,Can get seen,2/28/2022,4,Depending on the urgency of the issue it can take more time if it's not urgent but you can get seen when it's needed. Generally the staff are good and helpful and getting children seen has been easy.
Guildhall,Care great,2/28/2022,5,Had very good support from the surgery and care has been great. I've been able to get either a face to face or phone appointment and both work very well.
Guildhall,Care provided is good,3/18/2019,4,"Difficult to get blood tests at the surgery, patients are asked to go to the health centre in Sudbury which isn't always easy. Care provided by the surgery is very good, for a routine matter I got an appointment in a couple of weeks."
Guildhall,Difficult to see a doctor,2/28/2022,4,"It's been difficult to get to see a doctor. I needed to be seen but really struggled to see one, I did get a phone call but it's all been a bit disjointed. The staff have been very good when I've been seen."
Guildhall,Doctors are friendly and supportive,6/21/2018,5,Doctors are friendly and supportive. I can see my doctor when I need to and get the support I need. Referrals have been made quickly for further tests.
Guildhall,Easy to get appointments,6/12/2015,5,Getting appointments to see my doctor has never been a problem. I can see them whenever i need to.
Guildhall,Everything has been good for years.,7/30/2018,4,Everything has been good for years for me here. There has been a change though. The reception staff now try to persuade me to see a pharmacist rather than have a GP appointment. That doesn't work well for me. I work as a carer and my employer requires me to see a doctor not a pharmacist.
Guildhall,Excellent but too long wait for appointment,11/17/2016,5,Waiting time for appointments far too long
Guildhall,Excellent service,6/18/2016,5,I was away from home in Aldeburgh and the surgery when my husband rang to tell me that the surgery had rung and needed me to ring back. I rang my surgery and they told me that the antibiotics i was taking were not appropriate for me and i should stop taking them. They would replace them with different ones and represcribe. They got in touch with a pharmacy in Aldeburgh who got my medication ready for me. The surgery gave me directions to the pharmacy and i collected it 20 minutes later. The pharmacy also disposed of my old medicine. I'd started off feeling perplexed but the whole experience was excellent.

Guildhall,Friendly staff,2/28/2022,5,"Appointments are available in the right format when needed and I'm confident that I'm able to get seen when needed. Our son has needed to be seen recently and we've not had any issues getting them seen, I'm confident the appointments are available when needed.  The staff are really friendly and very helpful."
Guildhall,Getting appointments is difficult,4/13/2016,4,Getting an appointment with my doctor is difficult I was told I would have to wait 3 weeks to see them this time.
Guildhall,Good follow up,11/28/2022,4,The follow up and referrals have been good and I'm happy with the doctors here but it is a shame they have lost the doctors that were here. Considering the situation they are doing well and its not bad to get through on the phone. I don't particularly like the phone consulations as I don't feel the staff always get the full picture.
Guildhall,Good surgery hours,10/20/2015,5,The late opening times are really good as I don't have to take time off work.
Guildhall,Great improvement lately,7/14/2022,4,"I've definitely noticed a great improvement with the surgery lately. It's easier to get through on the phones, previously there were very long waits which was very frustrating.  This morning I called 1 hour ago and was given an appointment with the doctor straight away which is wonderful. The staff are all great, friendly and supportive and I can get to see the doctor whenever I need to, it works very well."
Guildhall,Hard to make an appointment,6/18/2016,4,Sometimes I find it hard to make an early appointment to see my doctor when I want.
Guildhall,Helpful & friendly,8/15/2016,4,Reception staff helpful & friendly.  GP good if a little time pressured.
Guildhall,Helpful staff,11/28/2022,4,"No problems getting to see a nurse, I call the surgery and the helpful staff arrange the appointment for me. I have a really fantastic doctor and I've seen them for many years, who's great, and I like that I can see them most of the time as they know me well.  It would help to have more evening appointments, especially for those who work."
Guildhall,Helpful staff,9/23/2021,4,Staff are in most cases very helpful.  Appointments available usually within a day or two
Guildhall,I really rate my doctor,6/11/2018,5,"Barrow branch. I have been a patient at the practice man and boy and I am 70 now. My wife has also been a patient for over 60 years. We have moved around a bit locally, in Bury for many years, and then we went to the Guildhall branch. We moved back near to Chedburgh after retirement and now we come here. It is great, free parking and the pharmacy on the same site, so convenient! I waited ten days for this appointment but it isn't urgent and I can get in on the day if I am really poorly. I really rate my (named) doctor and the receptionists are always so friendly."
Guildhall,It is great,1/3/2018,5,Appointments could certainly be a lot easier to get but once I get in there is is great.
Guildhall,Long waits on the phone,11/28/2022,3,To get a small child seen has always been good and they are always seen quickly and I do prescriptions online now which is much easier to do. The phones are busy and you do have to wait a while and when you get through staff are not always as helpful as they could be. Confidentiality is an issue in the reception area as you can hear everything being discussed.
Guildhall,Lovely doctor,6/13/2016,5,"I really like my doctor, they are lovely and we have a good rapport."
Guildhall,Muddled......,9/10/2018,2,I tried to book flu innoculations for both my husband and myself. They were running separate sessions each with a different serum. My husband is just over 65 and I am just under so the initial advice was that we should have different serums which meant we would have to attend different sessions. We didn't want to do that so we approached the pharmacy but their advice was that I should have the same serum as my husband as I was only weeks away from reaching 65-so we went back to the surgery and they finally agreed and we both had our jabs. Not a mega problem but so avoidable.
Guildhall,No issues,11/28/2022,4,"I've had no issues getting appointments by phone and booking it has worked well after speaking to reception, so I've had no problems, it's all good."
Guildhall,Nurses great,9/28/2016,5,"I have not had to go to the surgery for over a year. i was very surprised to see a nurse, who was friendly and kind. Made a big difference. The reception staff smiled and listened. Well done Guildhall surgery."
Guildhall,Patronising,6/18/2016,4,as I get older I find that I am increasingly treated in a patronising way.
Guildhall,Phone calls have addressed issues,11/28/2022,4,The phone calls with a doctor have addressed the issues I've had mainly but when I've needed an actual appointment they've been on the same day I've requested them which is good.  I mainly see the same GP and I'm really happy with how the GP is with me and explains things. Sometimes I have to wait a little longer to see someone specific but for urgent issues I've had appointments quickly.
Guildhall,Phone message is quite long,2/28/2022,4,I had a pre booked appointment with the nurse this morning which are always good. For general appointments I would normally call the surgery to get to see a doctor but I've also used econsult which worked well too. The message on the phone is quite long but the wait wasn't bad. The staff have been good and have helped to address the issues.
Guildhall,Phones are busy,2/28/2022,5,It's a brilliant surgery and the staff are excellent but the phones are busy when you try to get through to the surgery. Picking up prescriptions is difficult as I don't drive or live in Clare.
Guildhall,Poor,2/10/2022,2,Sent an econsult explaining difficulty in swallowing. Received a phone appointment in 3 weeks time. Duly received call. Dr unaware of my econsult. Almost admonished me for not phoning in for an urgent appointment! She said that econsult is only looked at by administration so i should have known it was an emergency and phoned in.! She referred me to endoscopy that v day and im having a camera tomorrow.
Guildhall,Poor communication & treatment,1/13/2022,1,"Difficult to get through on telephone. Tried several times , often wait upto half hour for an answer. Had symptoms of urine infection. Told to take sample to GP. Told I would get a call as an infection was suspected from sample. 
No call from GP, but pharmacy told me prescription to collect. Started on antibiotics. Rang surgery week later as still have symptoms of UTI. They had no record of testing my urine or sending it away to lab. A week wasted in trying to get me on correct treatment.  To get another appointment with GP I have to wait another 2 weeks."
Guildhall,Prefer not to tell reception,7/14/2022,3,I would prefer not to tell reception staff the reason for the appointment as it feels private. I've waited 5 weeks to see a specific GP. I was advised I could speak to a pharmacist for advice but decided to wait.  I try not to visit the surgery much but when I do the staff are friendly.
Guildhall,Should be able to offer more,7/27/2022,3,"I do think the surgery should be able to offer more first aid support, someone was visiting me and got something in his eye, it wasnt serious but needed to be checked, the surgery would not even take a look they just sent him away and said go to A & E. This seemed unecessary to me."
Guildhall,So busy,6/18/2016,5,Because they are so busy you always feel the need to rush off without really discussing problems
Guildhall,Staff are good,2/28/2022,4,I haven't needed many appointments recently but those I've had have all worked well and the staff have been good.
Guildhall,Staff create a good atmosphere,6/13/2016,5,The atmosphere created by all the staff makes the surgery. Being a small surgery means that it is very friendly. Blood tests are done at the surgery and there are no problems getting appointments.
Guildhall,Thorough conversations,2/28/2022,5,Only just needed to book a face to face appointment and it's been fine to get. Other than that I've had conversations with the doctor which have been thorough and sorted out the issues I've had.
Guildhall,Urgent appointments are fine to get,11/28/2022,4,It is better than it was but one receptionist does treat you a bit like a child. It did seem a bit odd when we were asked to call the reception team when we were in the surgery already during covid! Appointments for urgent issues are fine to get but I don't feel that some of the questions reception ask are necessary to get an appointment. Does the sign that says ask reception before using the toilet need to be there?
Guildhall,Very difficult to make an appointment with GP,8/25/2021,2,"Covid has been going on for 17 months. Why do patients have to stand in the path to knock on a window to get the receptionists attention? All correspondence and communication, however personal, is made public to those who are waiting in line. It's degrading and lacks any respect for privacy & dignity to be treated in this way."
Guildhall,Very easy this morning,7/14/2022,4,I called this morning and was given a face to face appointment with a doctor really quickly. Staff are helpful and explain issues really well and I find that it works very well for me. My husband however has struggled to get appointments a bit more in the past  and believes this will still be the case now.
Guildhall,Very good,11/28/2022,5,"Been a patient for a long time and there are brilliant doctors, who are very knowledgeable, and a wonderful reception team. I'm overly happy with the care provided as I get to see the same GP most of the time and I'm happy with the surgery overall."
Guildhall,Very lucky to have the surgery,11/28/2022,5,"Really rate the surgery. Straight in with an appointment when I called. I find the staff friendly, and doctors and nurses are great."
Guildhall,Very pleased,6/18/2016,5,I am always very pleased at the excellent care
Guildhall,Waiting times,6/18/2016,4,Waiting times for appointments are bad also it's difficult to get an appointment with any other doctor apart from your own
Guildhall,Well organised and efficient,5/9/2018,5,I suppose that one mark of a good practice is that you don't actually think about them. They are there with an appointment when i need one and by and large everything goes off well when I attend. The staff all seem very friendly and the whole organisation of the practice seems well organised and efficient
Guildhall,Working well,2/28/2022,4,"It's working well at the moment, the phone calls are working but I feel it's important that the appointment suits the individual."
Guildhall,Works well,11/28/2022,5,"I can't really find a fault with the surgery as when I've needed an appointment they've been fine to get, and it's easy to book appointments with the nurse. It all works so well."
Hadleigh,A good practice,5/28/2016,4,A very good practice with an efficient and friendly service.
Hadleigh,A good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"They try to accommodate  and fit you in where possible and I've always been able to get one when I've needed one. Having phone consultations has worked well too as an alternative as staff are good at explaining issues.  The dispensary very helpful and are great at sorting an issues out that come up, especially if I forget to put my prescription in on time!"
Hadleigh,A good surgery,1/23/2023,4,"It's a good surgery but I do find it difficult when care navigators asked why I need the appointment, especially when it is around my mental health. I'm not really sure why they ask the questions they do."
Hadleigh,A good surgery,12/13/2017,5,They will get you an appointment when you need one and they are a good surgery.
Hadleigh,A good surgery,3/15/2016,5,A good surgery offering good care
Hadleigh,A good surgery,3/15/2016,5,To get to see your own doctor can take a week but you can see any other doctor quickly. On occasions I have had to wait an hour for my appointment but generally it is much quicker and if someone needs extra time I'd hope I receive the same if needed.
Hadleigh,A great health centre,8/10/2015,5,Getting appointments is not a problem and I always see the same doctor. The physio at the health centre was really great following my hip replacement.
Hadleigh,A great surgery,6/28/2022,5,"Great staff happy to see any of them however I would prefer to see one doctor as it would be easier with my complicated condition.  I do feel very lucky with the surgery, if something urgent comes up you do get helped the same day."

Hadleigh,All good,7/13/2023,5,"Staff have been very good, they listen are helpful and accomodating.  They address issues quickly and I've found the phone consultations have worked well and have meant  I haven't needed to come in to the surgery as often. On the whole I've been able to get face to face appointments when needed, there have been occasions when appointments haven't been available  but I've always been given advice or a call back."
Hadleigh,"All very good, excellent",4/20/2016,5,"I've found them all very good, excellent. The new doctor has been really great at explaining everything."
Hadleigh,Almost always find a slot online for same day,2/14/2020,5,I appreciate the availability to book my appointments online and almost always find a slot on the same day. Very good surgery.

Hadleigh,Always ready to help,6/1/2017,4,This is a good surgery-always spotlessly clean and the staff are always ready to help.
Hadleigh,Amazing,6/19/2023,5,"Amazing how well the surgery does. All staff are friendly and I like that there are multiple ways of contacting the surgery and that you are given a choice of which doctor you'd like to see, the flexibility with the system is great."
Hadleigh,Appointments hard to get,6/5/2017,4,It is difficult to get appointments here. I do understand that it is not the fault of the staff and they are all very nice people. There is a shortage.
Hadleigh,Been very good,6/19/2023,5,It is a bit daunting when you are so high up in the queue on the phone but when you do get through you do get help.  Mainly I see the same GPs but I've been give choice over who to see and although there are new staff here the GPs I've seen have been very good. Overall its been a very good surgery.
Hadleigh,Best doctors,1/23/2023,5,I phoned this morning and after speaking to reception was given an appointment with a doctor. I find the reception staff really helpful and friendly and very happy to help. It would be nice to have a little more continuity but the care here is good.
Hadleigh,Best ever surgery,6/19/2023,5,It all works very well.  The staff are kind and helpful and I really like being able to book appointments online and having the ability to choose who you would like to see.  The GPs are exceptional especially the trainees.

Hadleigh,Brilliant!,6/18/2016,5,Dr. is brilliant
Hadleigh,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,"The phones are busy and can entail a long wait at times however you do get appointments when needed especially for the children which is great.  I haven't found that econsult gets dealt with on the day but I am happy to see any of the staff, they have all been good."
Hadleigh,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,When I called early this week I was 70th in the queue so I hung up and came down to the surgery to get the appointment. Today I was 21st in the queue and spoke to a GP and have since been invited in to have an appointment.  Reception are helpful and staff are lovely.  The only slight issue is that the dispensary isn't very private and it is always busy which means everyone can hear everything being said.

Hadleigh,Confused about annual health checks,9/21/2017,4,"Although care is good I was told that I was not able to have an annual health check as they were every five years, I thought they were more regular and used to prevent issues."
Hadleigh,Difficulties getting a baby seen,1/23/2023,3,We've had difficulties getting our baby seen and don't feel that our concerns are being taken seriously and we've been brushed off. I'm just concerned that I'm just seen as a panicking mum.
Hadleigh,Doctor missed two diagnosis opportunities,6/18/2018,3,A doctor at the surgery missed two opportunities to diagnose an issue that turned out to be serious. Other doctors identified and referred to hospital.

They are flexible with the children and GP's and other staff go above and beyond. I use the NHS App which works really well.

If they can't see you a doctor will call and then if you really need to go in they will squeeze you in at the end. Yesterday I received multiple text reminders telling me not to be late and then they saw me 40 mins late!  The attitude of some resptionists is not good. I requested a call back once and was told that because I wouldn't say why my husband needed to talk to the doctor they couldn't guarantee the doctor would call back. They did.
Hadleigh,Good advice given,2/14/2020,5,I phoned my GP surgery in March 2019 and the receptionist spoke immediately to the GP and the advice given was for us to phone 999 for an ambulance it was good advice as it was a stroke.

Hadleigh,Great,6/19/2023,5,Excellent service with very helpful reception staff.  Appointments are available with in a good timeframe and when calling the surgery it doesn't take long to get through unless you're calling first thing.

Hadleigh,Helpful,9/29/2016,4,Doctor was helpful and supportive to my needs
Hadleigh,Helpful staff,3/15/2016,5,To help me a member of staff will accompany me in the lift when needed.  I do have problems getting on to the couch in the room and on one occasion the doctor gave me a stool to stand on.

Hadleigh,Marvellous Surgery,2/14/2020,5,I find the staff to be really helpful and the doctors and the nurses are all very nice. I have never had a problem getting an appointment when I need one. I think this is a marvellous surgery.

Hadleigh,Most helpful reception & telephone staff,2/14/2020,5,Most helpful reception and telephone staff. Minimal delay in making appointments. The duty doctor is available at short notice (15 mins in an emergency for me)!! Very helpful and patient telephone conversation had with my doctor.

Hadleigh,No complaints whatsoever,4/20/2016,5,No complaints whatsoever. I get to see the same doctor all the time but if I needed urgent care I can see any one of the doctors.
Hadleigh,No issues at all,6/19/2023,4,"Always been a very good surgery,  I phone to get appointments and get through fairly quickly and I'm able to get appointments.  The staff are so good too, never any issues there as they are all so lovely. I find it much easier to get my bloods done here rather than trying to go elsewhere, its much quicker."
Hadleigh,No issues getitng appointments,1/23/2023,4,"I've had no issues getting appointments and I'm confident that when I need one I will get one and I'm happy to see any of the staff, they are all good. I do feel however that at times they could be more compassionate and sensitive around weight issues. A family member had all of the problems and pain they were experiencing put down to their weight and they weren't listend to.  When finally they were referred for a scan and gallstones were found which could've been dealt with sooner if their weight wasn't put as the reason.  Asthma care has been very good and recently when I had problems I was seen with in 2 hours and given great advice and a reveised treatment plan."
Hadleigh,No issues getting appointments,6/7/2022,5,Getting appointments isn't an issue and they run efficiently and to time.  The nurses are currently booking my appointments following each visit and they are just great as they explain everything really well and are so approachable.  I've found getting online has worked very well too.  The only difficulty is the parking is limited.
Hadleigh,None,7/31/2015,5,5 star
Hadleigh,Not informed of changes to diabetic footcare,3/15/2016,4,"I previously had my feet done every two months as I have diabetes. I hadn't heard anything about an appointment so I called and got one the next day but they didn't tell me that they had stopped offering check ups every two months, this only happened later."
Hadleigh,on time!,6/1/2017,5,"Quick, efficient appointments, on time!"
Hadleigh,Phones busy,1/23/2023,4,The phones are busy when you try to get through but I have always got an appointment when I've spoken to reception. The doctors are good but I do prefer to see a female doctor if possible as I find them more understanding and interested. Overall though the surgery is good but I'm unclear on the Care Navigators role and why they want the details they ask for.
Hadleigh,Prefer more contact with receptionists,3/8/2018,5,I would prefer more face to face contact with the reception staff rather than using the computer to check in. The doctors are very good and you can get appointments when you need them.
Hadleigh,Prompt home visit,3/16/2016,5,We had to call the doctor out when I had an inner ear infection. With in minutes the doctor arrived and arranged medication to be picked up.
Hadleigh,Really good surgery,3/15/2016,5,Sometimes seeing your own doctor can be difficult but really good surgery.
Hadleigh,Runs to time,2/26/2019,5,"I don't have any problems getting appointments at the surgery, they normally run to time aswell. The doctors are good at looking at your notes before appointments, which means you don't have to go over issues with them."
Hadleigh,See your own doctor,3/8/2018,5,You will always get an appointment even if it's not with your own doctor and they are all very good and it works well for me.
Hadleigh,Seen quickly,3/15/2016,5,"My last visit took 35 minutes from the time I contacted the surgery through to seeing the doctor which was brilliant. The customer care at the surgery is also great, they are very accommodating and will help you out."
Hadleigh,Staff are good,1/23/2023,5,I booked my appointment through SystmOnline yesterday evening and was able to select a suitable appointment. The staff are all good and I'm happy to see any GP so that makes it easier. Calling the surgery can mean a bit of a wait on the phone which is why I prefer online contact.
Hadleigh,Staff are good,3/16/2016,5,Staff are good and I'm seen with in 10-15 minutes
Hadleigh,Staff are helpful to me,2/14/2020,5,"It is a very good surgery, The staff are always helpful to me. I sometimes just put my head in the door for a chat and they seem happy to see me."
Hadleigh,Staff are really helpful,4/20/2016,5,No trouble getting an appointment. Staff are really helpful a great surgery.

Hadleigh,Staff make the surgery,3/16/2016,5,The doctors really make the surgery. The other staff are also very helpful.
Hadleigh,Surgery has a great atmosphere,4/20/2016,5,The staff all work well together and there is a good atmosphere. The reception staff are great and we are very well looked after
Hadleigh,Surgery really know their patients,6/20/2017,5,The surgery really know their patients and are very friendly with the children. The surgery is modern which really helps.
Hadleigh,The best by far,9/21/2017,5,The best health centre by far. Get to see my doctor regularly and have no problems getting appointments. Its got everything you need including minor surgery.
Hadleigh,Very considerate of peoples individual needs,11/2/2016,5,The surgery will organise for the people I care for with dementia to visit at quiet times of the day. They will always call back if they have any problems. They are excellent.
Hadleigh,Very efficient,3/16/2016,5,I had problems with the eye drops prescribed by the hospital. I told my GP who contacted the hospital and they were changed with in days.
Hadleigh,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"I called at 8am and had received a call back with a doctor by 9.30 and have been asked to come to the surgery.  My medication has been looked in to and changed, a scan was booked and results have all been fed back to me.  It's always a good experience here for the whole family as staff are helpful.  The only slight difficulty is receiving call backs when at work as it can be tricky to take the call."
Hadleigh,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"Caring nature of the doctors is great, they're very calm and it's an effcient surgery. Appointments have been easy to arrange and call backs from doctors come through quickly.  The doctors have been great and whenever we've needed house calls we've not waited long, they've been very supportive, it's a brilliant surgery. I think they've got it just right."
Hadleigh,Very good,1/23/2023,5,"You don't have to wait long for appointments, care is marvellous and the staff are great, I really can't fault the surgery."
Hadleigh,Very good,2/25/2019,5,The surgery in Hadleigh is very good but very busy.  You can always get an appointment when needed and the call backs from doctors work wel. Staff are helpful and will do what they can to sort any issues out. The online system works well as does the automated appointment system. They keep patients well informed if they are running behind by considerable amounts.
Hadleigh,Very good practice,6/1/2017,4,This is a very good practice. I get good quality care and there are rarely any delays
Hadleigh,Very happy with the surgery,4/20/2016,5,I'm very happy with the surgery. I can get appointments when I need them and I have regular asthma check ups.
Hadleigh,Very happy with the surgery,4/20/2016,5,Very happy with the surgery. The only issue is sometimes getting an appointment is difficult but you do get to see someone.Having to phone on the morning can make arranging transport difficult.
Hadleigh,Very helpful reception,1/23/2023,5,"I pre booked my appointment online, I had a call from a GP and then I was given a face to face appointment. The reception staff are all very helpful and clinicians explain issues really well.  I really like being able to book actual appointments online too, that makes it much easier."
Hadleigh,Very lucky,5/13/2019,5,Very lucky to have sucha  good surgery. They are very accomodating and you get to see the doctor when needed/ Its easy to get regular blood tests done at the surgery and the holistic care offered is great. Really like that other services visit the health centre too.
Hadleigh,Very lucky,4/20/2016,5,"We are very luck here, the general attitude of staff is great and doctors are pleasant and take time with you."
Hadleigh,Very poor,4/5/2017,1,"Seen by a locum.  Patient has learning difficulties and was told to  ""get a job"".  Saw GP for back pain - told to contact physio but not shown how."
Hadleigh,Very Unimpressed,9/29/2016,2,"Having visited a variety of Doctors at the practice over the past few years, the majority have been okay. However some GP's are particularly rude, unsympathetic and lack the ability to give any explanation to the patient!  Made to feel very much uncomfortable and too intimidated to ask following questions. Leading to a inconclusive appointment with lacking results, that is likely to mean i will have to in a short space of time see another doctor and consume more time for something very simple that doesn't require anything more than a couple of referrals! 

Receptionists are rude, - Trying to book an appointment is increasingly difficult and no matter when you phone - availability is generally poor. 

Waiting times are like most NHS funded services - LONG but within reason i understand this cant always be helped.

The whole experience is very frustrating to say the least, and its not the first. I now avoid going to the doctors because of a loss of faith in that they'll say anything at all productive or helpful, due to so many bad experiences. 

Very Let down by my local surgery."
Hadleigh,Waiting for appointments.,7/19/2016,4,Quicker times needed on waiting for appointments
Hadleigh,Waiting times are good,3/15/2016,5,"Waiting times are good, I was seen before my actual appointment time on my last visit which was great."
Hadleigh,Waits can be long,3/15/2016,5,Sometimes the waits can be long and I get a little impatient.
Hadleigh,Works well,1/23/2023,5,"I use a mix of contacting by phone and online to get appointments and have not had any issues and feel that the system in place works well. Staff explain things well and go through issues carefully. I'm very happy with the surgery, we're very lucky."
Hadleigh,Worried I've not been listened to,1/23/2023,3,It has been a bit problematic getting seen and being listened to. I don't feel that my concerns are being taken seriously while I'm waiting for an operation. There appears there is nothing they will do to help.
Hardwick,3 week wait for an appointment,10/20/2016,4,Have to wait 3 weeks for an appointment.  GP printed out info for me
Hardwick,A bit frustrating trying to get through,8/20/2021,4,It was a little frustrating trying to get through on the phone this morning but I got an appointment ok which was great. I haven't been to the surgery for years so I can't really comment further other than to say that the staff have been very good today.
Hardwick,A bit tricky at the moment,11/24/2021,4,I've found using econsult a bit tricky at the moment. I called the surgery and was asked to do an econsult submission but when I did it said I needed to speak to a doctor. I called reception and explained what had happened and they asked me to call back in the morning as there was nothing available.
Hardwick,A great service,4/5/2017,5,A really great surgery.  My husband has a few conditions and if there is ever an emergency they will always make sure he is seen quickly
Hardwick,Absolutely amazing!,4/10/2015,5,"Staff, especially reception staff, are very friendly, polite and helpful. Also excellent waiting times!"
Hardwick,All good,11/24/2021,5,"I tend to go to the most local surgery to me for convenience. The flu vaccinations have been very proactive this year, they contacted me to say that I was eligible and could be booked in. Everything has been explained well and staff have all been nice but I do feel that some continuity has been lost with the changes introduced and the new staff at the surgery."
Hardwick,Always do their best to help.,3/2/2017,5,The staff always do their best to help you.  If you are ill and can't see your own doctor you will always be given an appointment with another doctor.  Not being able to do prescriptions over the phone anymore is difficult.  I have had good support for my mental health from this surgery
Hardwick,Always helpful.,12/5/2016,5,Always helpful to our nursing home.
Hardwick,An hour to get through,2/3/2022,3,I rang up yesterday to try to get an appointment for my young daughter but was noy given one so I had to take her to the hospital. However I phoned this morning and I was given an appointment for her. It took an hour to get through on the phone. Staff attitudes are variable depending on who you get but the doctor we see here is lovely.
Hardwick,Appointment arranged easily,8/20/2021,4,"I phoned this morning and didn't have to wait long on the phone, I then spoke to a nurse and she arranged for me to have an appointment so the system has worked well for me. I've only registered here recently and that side of things went really smoothly, with the staff being really helpful."
Hardwick,appointment system is improved,10/25/2019,4,I would like to see the ladies toilet to be cleaner. I do find that a couple of reception staff can be a bit rude in their approach. 3 of the doctors here are brilliant. The appointment system is improved and its very handy to have 5 practices in the group.
Hardwick,Appointment system working well,8/20/2021,5,"It can take a long time to get through on the phone and you can get down to 2 in the queue and then get cut off by the system which has happened a few times. The system to get appointments, I feel is working better than before and you can get on the day appointments. The staff are very nice, helpful receptionists and the doctors and nurses have time for you and you don't feel rushed."
Hardwick,Appointments available when needed,11/24/2021,4,I find that we can get appointments when we need them and there are no real issues at the surgery. Staff are also really nice when you see them.
Hardwick,Appointments difficult to get,4/20/2018,4,Difficult to get appointments. Can be none available on the day you call and you just have to phone back the next day or at times staff can book you an appointment in advance in about a weeks time.
Hardwick,Attitude on phone could be improved,2/3/2022,4,"The attitude on the phone could be improved, some improvement has been noted but still some more room for improvement. Length of time waiting on the phone to get through can be variable it was 15 mins today but it has been much longer."
Hardwick,Brilliant,8/20/2021,5,"I've been looked after very well, they have been so proactive with my care. During covid it has been a bit different but once you are through to the surgery the staff are very good."
Hardwick,Brilliant and they explain what's happening,6/21/2018,5,"Brilliant, they see you as soon as they can, they explain what's happening and I get to see my regular doctor, which is very good."
Hardwick,Brilliant surgery - never had a problem,8/30/2018,5,"Brilliant surgery, been with them for years and have never had a problem. Care has always been good."
Hardwick,Busy phones,8/8/2022,4,"Generally it's good to get appointments, the queue on the phone can be quite long but you do get through in the end and appointments are available.  I tend to call the surgery and it works well apart from the wait on the line. It will be beneficial to have the new surgery site, if it goes ahead."
Hardwick,Can get appointments,12/14/2018,4,You can get an appointment with any doctor but to see a specific one takes more time. Continuity is really key and important to me so I do prefer to see the same GP. The chairs are hard and not very comfortable and there are no toys for the children. Also there are no magazines or anything to read.
Hardwick,Cannot get an appointment with my GP,11/15/2019,1,I'm concerned that I cannot get an appointment with my doctor as advised by my doctor. I am highly concerned and frustrated. I have come to Bures surgery today as it is an emergency.
Hardwick,Cant hear when I'm called,2/3/2022,4,The Tannoy speaker system is not at all clear or loud enough in the waiting area.
Hardwick,Continuity is a problem,9/12/2016,3,"Saw my doctor who said come back to see me, but then you can't get an appointment with them.  Not having continuity for ongoing issues is then difficult as I don't have enough time to go over everything with them."
Hardwick,Continuity is a problem,8/22/2016,4,Continuity of care is a big problem. I've had about 10 GPs over the years but this means that when I ask for medication reviews the locums always say you need to see your named GP but because they change so much this is very difficult. Because no one doctor is looking at my medication it's meant I've had a lot of contraindications that have caused complications with my health.
Hardwick,Could be quicker with appointments,4/10/2015,3,Some staff could be friendlier and more helpful but good overall.
Hardwick,Could not find contact Dr on line,5/18/2022,2,Could not find link to make an appointment.
Hardwick,Didn't take me seriously,4/12/2015,2,The doctor mainly spoke to my Dad and not me.  They didn't take my complaint seriously.
Hardwick,Difficult to get an appointment,2/25/2019,2,"It is very difficult to get an appointment, I did manage to get one a couple of days in advance recently but my husband has had to wait until next week. Parking at the surgery is very difficult and there is only a limited amount of disabled parking. The staff though are efficient and try."
Hardwick,Difficult to get appointment,8/25/2019,3,Trying to get an appointment is quite difficult and getting the consistency of the same GP is not easy. I do feel I was misdiagnosed once.
Hardwick,Difficult to get appointment,6/18/2018,3,It's very difficult to get an appointment and I have had an issue when an appointment was at one of the branch surgeries but I was not aware this had not been booked at the main surgery.
Hardwick,Difficult to get to see doctor,12/8/2016,4,The appointment system at the surgery is not good. I tried to get an appointment with my husbands GP for 4 weeks time at the GPs request but when I tried to book the receptionist said I couldn't book that far ahead and would need to call in 2 weeks. When I called again I was told no appointments were available. My husband desperately needed to see his doctor as his medication had run out. They did arrange for us to see a different doctor who sorted part of the issue out but he still needed to see his own doctor.  I tried again to get an appointment but was told I couldn't book yet for that particular doctor and needed to call back so i explained the issue and arranged for my husband to be seen the next day as an emergency.
Hardwick,Difficulty in booking appointments,8/16/2021,1,Despite being advised by the pharmacist that I need anti biotics I could not book an appointment other than at 8am each day. I have to work at 8am so have not been able to make an appointment. I will probably end up going to A & E. This booking system is quite ridiculous and illogical.
Hardwick,Difficulty with booking appointments,9/12/2016,4,The online system doesn't allow you to see as many appointments as you expect.  There can be up to 10 days wait for an appointment to see someone for non-urgent issues.
Hardwick,Doctor did not give full time for appointment,8/23/2018,2,Would not recommend this particular doctor. Went in with chest pain and was told to just monitor the situation. I was not given the full time for the appointment and I did not feel like I was listened to or that the doctor cared. Felt like I was moved on too quickly or pushed out the door. Made me feel like he didn't believe me or that I was over-reacting.
Hardwick,Doctor is very good with dementia issues,7/4/2016,5,There are 4-4 doctors at the Cornard surgery on a rota basis. We have one doctor who is very good with dementia issues. We can see her at either surgery
Hardwick,Doctors don't really listen to you,6/21/2018,2,Doctors don't really listen to you at the surgery. I go back for help but you go around in circles and they don't seem to progress at all.
Hardwick,Doing well,5/12/2022,5,The surgery are doing very well under the circumstances and I've always been able to get appointments when needed so I'm happy with the surgery.
Hardwick,double appointments,7/4/2016,4,Not being able to get an appointment to see the same doctor for a single problem unless you could travel to Clare or Bures was a problem but double appointments are now available with is VERY GOOD!
Hardwick,Drs and nurses are lovely,11/24/2021,5,Booking appointments by phone works well and I can get appointments for general problems or blood tests easily. The doctors and nurses are lovely and I've never had any problems.
Hardwick,Easier if visit the surgery,12/20/2018,4,Difficult to get through on the phone to get an appointment. You are told that there are no appointments available so I tend to go to the surgery to book as you are assured an appointment. We do get to see the same doctor most of the time which is good and helps to encourage good communication as they know you so well.
Hardwick,Econsult has its place,8/8/2022,4,"For certain issues econsult has it's place but at times it is more appropriate to call the surgery. Generally I'm happy with the surgery and being able to get help when it is needed. At times reception can lack a little empathy and it does feel that they can't wait to get you off the phone, it can vary a little at the different surgery sites."
Hardwick,Econsult works,11/24/2021,5,It's good at the surgery. I tend to use econsult to contact the surgery and get call backs when needed or I've been offered an appointment if its been needed. Staff are excellent and they've always been lovely on the phone.
Hardwick,Econsult works well,8/8/2022,4,"I find using econsult great, it's much easier to use and a great alternative to calling the surgery, having said that it wasn't working this morning. I'm happy to see any of the clinicians as the care you get when here can't be faulted, the only issue is if you have to call the surgery as the phones are very busy."
Hardwick,Efficient service,6/10/2016,4,Its a good efficient service.
Hardwick,Everything is generally OK.,2/21/2017,4,Happy with the doctors.  No problems getting appointments.  Everything is generally ok when I need to use them.
Hardwick,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Sometimes the staff don't look at me when they are talking with me.  My support worker goes with me to my appointments and explains things to me after the appointment.  The staff are very friendlly
Hardwick,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Waits are not too excessive but to see a specific doctor can mean longer waits to get an appointment.  At times you do need to ask the doctor to explain things more clearly
Hardwick,Excellent,4/12/2015,4,It was good and helpful.  They listened carefully to what we were saying
Hardwick,Excellent,9/10/2015,5,Excellent service
Hardwick,"Excellent care, appointments hard to get",11/17/2016,5,"Getting appointments is a little bit difficult and I had to wait over a week to see any doctor and over two to see a specific doctor, but care is good and I like the surgery"
Hardwick,fair,6/21/2016,3,"Getting an appointment normally takes 3 - 4 days.  I don't then like being asked to call back on the day for ongoing issues.  They have been quite good for emergency appts, very accommodating fitting me in"
Hardwick,Fair but hard to get appointments,4/4/2017,3,Can't get through on the phone or get appointments.  I don't drive and therefore being offered appointments at the other surgery sites is not suitable but this means I have to wait a long time to see a doctor
Hardwick,Feel appointments are limited,11/24/2021,3,I definitely feel that face to face appointments are limited and that you can only get a call back. Getting through in the morning to the surgery isn't too bad which is good.
Hardwick,Feels a bit stressed,5/12/2022,4,The surgery does feel a bit stressed and under staffed but more recently I have been able to get on the day appointments more easily. I have had to wait 3 weeks for a blood pressure check but I'm not sure if that is normal or not. The staff are friendly but it does feel busy.
Hardwick,Fine to get appointments,8/8/2022,5,Generally it's been ok to get appointments. Depending on the situation I'm happy to see any doctor rather than seeing someone specific. I've not had any issues getting appointments and I'm happy with all the staff who are helpful and supportive.
Hardwick,Flexible appointments,11/24/2021,4,I've arranged to have my flu jab today at the surgery and it's been easy to arrange with flexible appointments which has allowed me to attend on my day off which was great.
Hardwick,Friendly staff,11/24/2021,4,"I don't need to use the surgery much but when I have it all seems to work well as you can get appointments and get issues sorted, so it all seems fine to me. The staff are friendly too which makes a big difference."
Hardwick,Friendly staff and care is good,4/26/2018,5,Not always the best at explanations but the care is good and staff are friendly.
Hardwick,Generally a good surgery,4/20/2018,4,The nurse that does my INR tests is very good but I have had difficulties getting the right treatment for a problem and then getting the prescription. Generally its a good surgery.
Hardwick,Generally difficult,11/24/2021,2,It's generally difficult to see who you want when you want which means that there is limited continuity with them which I think is really important with a chronic condition. Not having full access to the doctor throughout covid has been difficult and just speaking to them hasn't been enough. Now that I've been in to hospital I've started seeing them more.
Hardwick,Generally happy with the service,11/8/2016,4,Have to phone on the day to get an appointment which isn't always ideal but I'm generally happy with the service.
Hardwick,Get to see one GP mostly,12/14/2018,5,"Very happy with GP, get to see one GP most of the time and very pleased with the care provided. Staff are accommodating and will help to sort out any problems with medication."
Hardwick,Getting appointments isn't easy,8/15/2016,4,To get an appointment is not easy.  I called on Monday to see a specific doctor but was told none were available
Hardwick,Getting through can be difficult,8/20/2021,4,The phone lines are the main issue as getting through can be difficult and takes some time. At times staff can be a bit brusque but more recently staff including doctors have been very good.
Hardwick,Given excellent treatment,7/15/2016,5,I rang for an appointment and they were all full.  I explained my symptoms and they said come and wait.  I was seen after 45 minutes wait and given excellent treatment.
Hardwick,Given options,8/8/2022,5,"It's very good, I phone for appointments and never have an issue getting them. I'm given options for appointment on the day and can request a specific doctor but it can take a bit longer to see them. The doctors are very good and provide great support.  It would be great if disabled parking could be available at the surgery."
Hardwick,Go the extra mile,9/22/2016,5,They care and go the extra mile
Hardwick,Good,7/3/2019,4,Doctors and nurses are very good: they give me confidence.  My carer goes with me and they help explain what the doctor has said.
Hardwick,good,7/3/2019,4,There are no advance appts available which can be inconvenient when trying to plan.  Especially for routine appts. it would be great.  Never go in on time - at least 20 -30 minutes delay.  Treatment explanation is a little lacking at times
Hardwick,Good,7/12/2015,4,It was good because the doctor that saw me really listened to me and understood what I said
Hardwick,Good,4/12/2015,3,Fast getting an appointment.
Hardwick,Good,4/12/2015,4,It was a good asthma review. didn't have to wait too long and they were very gentle when I had my jab
Hardwick,Good,4/12/2015,4,It was just a general checkup.  There was a little delay but the service was good.
Hardwick,Good as they explained what would happen,12/22/2015,4,It was good as they explained what they would be doing and talked me through it as they were doing it.
Hardwick,Good care and friendly staff,6/7/2018,5,Not always the best at explanations but the care is good and staff are friendly.
Hardwick,Good explanations & lovely staff,11/17/2016,4,"Lovely staff, good at listening to me.  Very thorough expanations are given"
Hardwick,Good for house visits,12/8/2016,4,Generally I have house calls and the doctors do all they can for me.
Hardwick,Good solid practice,4/10/2015,4,I am pleased that they have a patients group.
Hardwick,Good surgery,8/8/2022,5,I've not needed many appointments and mainly see the nurses when I do but it works well for me and the surgery and staff overall are good.
Hardwick,good surgery,8/17/2016,5,"The surgery is good, the doctors are great and very approachable"
Hardwick,Good surgery and can usually get appointment,4/5/2017,4,A good surgery.  Can generally get an appointment when needed
Hardwick,Great Dr's and nurses,11/19/2021,5,"I've found it easy to get through to the surgery on the phone and they've done brilliantly well arranging appointments. Doctors and nurses are really great, they are so helpful and on the ball the whole time. Everyone there has been absolutely wonderful."
Hardwick,Great service by GPs and staff,1/17/2022,5,No problem with getting appointment.  GPs listen
Hardwick,Great speed & support,7/20/2022,5,I requested a call back from a GP for some medication advice. I was called back within the hour. The Doctor was so understanding and helpful.
Hardwick,Great to have appointments locally,12/19/2018,5,"Generally if you're from the village you will get in to the Bures surgery for an appointment when you need one, if you call first thing.  There's only one GP on but its good that you can have an appointment in the village."
Hardwick,Had to wait for over an hour,8/25/2019,4,"Had to wait over an hour for one appointment, but accept doctor is busy."
Hardwick,Happy with how it works,8/20/2021,4,It's very good as you can get an appointment when needed and the telephone triage works well for me. The staff have been very helpful and friendly too.
Hardwick,Happy with staff,5/12/2022,4,"Have had no problems getting to see a doctor for mainly pre booked appointments. I try to see the same GP if at all possible, however, they are all good and I'm really happy with all the staff. There have been medication delays where I've got down to my last few tablets before being able to pick them up. The pharmacy blames the surgery and they blame the pharmacy. The phones lines are busy and it can take time to get through and to speak to someone but you do get through in the end."
Hardwick,Happy with surgery,5/12/2022,4,The phones are busy but once through appointments are available and I've been given an appointment with a doctor after talking to them this morning. I'm happy with the surgery and the way they go through things and I try to only visit when I really need to. I've not had any recent difficulties getting appointments.
Hardwick,Happy with the surgery,9/14/2022,5,I'm happy with the surgery as I've been able to get the appointments I need and have found the process to get either a face to face or a triage call works well and the staff are good.
Hardwick,Hard to get through on phone,2/28/2023,4,I find that they are very efficient here but I just find it so difficult to get through on the phone you have to wait for such a long time.
Hardwick,Hard to get through on phone,2/3/2022,2,"It is hard to get through on the phone to get an appointment, it took me about half an hour to get through. Once you are here the staff are helpful."
Hardwick,Harsh attitude,2/3/2022,2,I have had to fight for diagnosis and treatment for my condition and I would like them to investigate it further because of my age. I find that the front desk have a harsh attitude and could be more courteous.
Hardwick,Hopeless,5/21/2021,1,"You can’t book an appt unless you call within a 2 hour window. Call at the end and all the appts are gone, call at the start and you don’t get through because of course everyone is calling at that time. They’ve got rid of online booking which was always effective. Econsult booking makes you answer questions with no option for “N/A” so you either have to leave it or lie. Then when you ever do manage to use that service effectively, they send you emails with different days of when they will call, neither of which they will actually call you on. You call back to find out what’s going on and they say they’ll call you today then don’t. All in all COMPLETELY INACCESSIBLE.
Side note- they don’t even keep your records up to date and don’t even change it when you request them to!!"
Hardwick,I spoke to a Doctor on the telephone.,12/1/2023,5,I was welcomed from a polite receptionist on the phone in which I asked for a call back from the Doctor. I was called back shortly after by a Doctor who was polite and courteous on the phone and really listened to me. I had an overall great experience from this doctor and will be asking to be treated by her going forward.
Hardwick,Informative,7/10/2015,5,Very helpful and informative.
Hardwick,Issues with prescription,9/12/2022,2,"I requested my prescription through the practice website which is excellent and convenient however when I went to collect it from Tesco (nominated pharmacy confirmed via email) it wasn’t there, I was informed there had been some staffing issues so tried again the next day where it was found that my prescription had been sent to Superdrug instead, leaving me without medication for 2 days, I can survive without mine for two days but someone else might not be able to, this is unacceptable!"
Hardwick,Issues with prescription,9/12/2022,2,"I requested my prescription through the practice website which is excellent and convenient however when I went to collect it from Tesco (nominated pharmacy confirmed via email) it wasn’t there, I was informed there had been some staffing issues so tried again the next day where it was found that my prescription had been sent to Superdrug instead, leaving me without medication for 2 days, I can survive without mine for two days but someone else might not be able to, this is unacceptable!"
Hardwick,It's a great Surgery on the whole,2/3/2022,5,"Staff are friendly and have a willingness to help. I have always found the doctors to be professional and polite. You can be on the phone waiting to get through for about 45 mins. The online way of contacting the doctor is ok but some of the questions are a bit misleading and not always hitting the point, you almost have to not tell the truth on some points to get through to the next page, I think it needs to be tweaked. It has taken me about a week to get this appointment but you do get choice if you want a phone consultation or face to face.  The surgery itself could do with a lick of paint, it is looking a bit tired in the waiting area."
Hardwick,Lack of appointments.,8/25/2019,3,Lack of appointments available. had one previous bad experience with GP.
Hardwick,Making an appointment,4/21/2022,5,"At 8 am I phoned to make an appointment to see a doctor, was 14th in the queue. Was given an appointment for 10 am the same day. Awesome!"
Hardwick,Most doctors are excellent,10/25/2019,5,The waiting time at appointment can be longer depending on the doctor. WE have to say apart from one doctor this is an excellent surgery.
Hardwick,My dr has time for me.,8/12/2017,4,Difficult to maintain continuity with my Dr but I prefer it as I feel they have time for me compared to some of the other dr's.
Hardwick,Need more car parking spaces,6/7/2018,3,Parking the car was difficult in the morning at the surgery. There is a lot of garden out the back. Maybe cut that back to make few more spaces.
Hardwick,No baby changing facilities,2/3/2022,4,"Making an appointment on the whole is ok I have never tried to use the online way of booking yet. I would just say that I have a small child and there are no changing facilities available here, that would be helpful to me. Parking is not good at this surgery but guess they cant do much about that."
Hardwick,No complaints at all,2/3/2022,5,I like the easiness and satisfaction of the service. I have been a patient here for 5 years and I have no complaints at all. Good clear explanation from the GP.
Hardwick,Not able to see the same doctor,7/4/2016,3,This is a pretty good practice the only difficulty is that it isn't possible to see the same doctor twice.
Hardwick,Not always easy to get through,8/25/2019,5,Not always easy to get through on the phone
Hardwick,Not enough options to contact GP or surgery,10/14/2021,3,"Telephone lines impossible to access, especially on a Monday. Waited 25 mins until I could go in call queue (No. 18 in queue) trying two different surgeries constantly for those 25 mins and then another 12 mins for a receptionist to answer! on two separate days. All patients advised to call from 8am creating the issue. By the time I did get through on second day no appointments available and told to call back at 12 for duty doctor. No longer the option for online contact and emails sent requesting doctors help for further advice refused as not policy!"
Hardwick,Not usually kept waiting,8/25/2019,4,"No issues with staff, not usually kept waiting."
Hardwick,Nurses are great,5/12/2022,4,"I've been on the phone up to 40 minutes waiting to get through and talk to reception. I understand that staff are stressed but they can come across as a little sharp at times. I know they have to ask why I need an appointment but the way in which it is asked is almost a barrier. By just saying I'm sorry but I need to ask ..... is much softer and feels very different to, why do you need an appointment?  I do find it hard to hear the patients being called via the intercom especially if you sit in the smaller area by the internal door. The nurses here are great, I really rate them."
Hardwick,Ok,7/12/2015,3,It was allright when I was ill
Hardwick,Ok,7/12/2015,3,ok
Hardwick,Online system easy to use,10/5/2018,5,It's close to home which is good. I don't visit very often and can get appointments when I need them. Its easy to use the online system and it allows you to book appointments at suitable times and see the doctor you prefer.
Hardwick,Overall good,3/23/2016,4,My overall experience has been good although I have had two poor experiences recently: Poor advice and a bad attitude from one GP.
Hardwick,Parking is an issue,8/8/2022,4,"It's been difficult to see a specific GP, there are either no appointments available or long waits for them. I prefer to see a doctor but have spoken to them on the phone and this has sorted most issues out.  I'm having a blood pressure check today and that has been quick and easy to get."
Hardwick,Phone consultation worked,11/24/2021,4,"I had a phone consultation which worked well and resulted in an actual appointment. I do find it a bit difficult not being able to book appointments ahead of time as I don't work locally. I've not been to this surgery before and the closure of the Clare branch has made it more inconvenient. Signage for this branch isn't good, it would be helpful if something was outside the building."
Hardwick,Phone wasn't bad when I called,8/8/2022,5,When I called to book the appointment the phone line wasn't bad and I managed to get an appointment with a doctor for later in the week after the surgery sent me a letter. The care provided by staff is good.
Hardwick,Phones very busy,8/12/2022,2,Gettiing through on the phone can take 45 mins  and there are then very limited appointments available. It's just got much harder to get an appointment now than it was.
Hardwick,Poor mental health support,4/8/2021,2,"Mixed feelings over Hardwicke House. Whenever I've seen them regarding physical conditions - they've been efficient and supportive. Quite the opposite when I've sought help with mental health issues. No empathy, no support and generally can't be bothered."
Hardwick,Poor processes,12/19/2018,1,"We told the surgery that we were moving to a near by village and were told it was ok to stay with the surgery so I filled in the forms with our new address. It was only when we chased a referral to hospital that we received a letter that had been delivered to our old address that said that the whole family had been removed from the practice list. They had my new address but delivered by hand the letter, no stamp, to our old address. I tried to appeal but was told the decision had been made and nothing could be done, Because we weren't informed our notes were then sent to a central holding place and we had to register with a new surgery. The referral that should've been underway while we were still patients hadn't been processed and this has delayed treatment by 18 weeks and had other consequences too."
Hardwick,Poor with appointments and GP's not very approachable.,1/8/2017,1,Very difficult to get  appointments. Can be 3 - 4 weeks for any doctor.  Getting to the other surgery sites is also very difficult for me.  Each time you visit you have to go over all your history as they don't read the notes already on the system and they don't know you.  Doctors are distant and not very approachable.
Hardwick,Prefer continuity with doctors,3/18/2019,5,"No issues getting appointments,having the different locations for appointments helps. I do prefer to see the same gp as I dislike seeing different doctors all the time especially locums as it impacts on the quality of care provided."
Hardwick,Pretty good,5/12/2022,4,No issues getting appointments when you do get through to the surgery. I'm going with the flow with the doctor I see and I've found pre arranged appointments easy to get.  The GPs I've met have all been good and I've been very pleased with them. There are longer waits on the phone now and I stopped using econsult as I was under the belief that it was an external system I was using and not my surgery so I cancelled the submission I started.
Hardwick,Pretty good access,11/24/2021,5,I don't tend to need to use the surgery much but when I do there's pretty good access. The phone lines are possibly the weakest point as it can take time to get through to reception but staff provide good information and support. I feel that the proposed new building and site is essential and well over due.
Hardwick,Quite quick to get through,8/8/2022,5,I've had no problems. When I've called its generally been quite quick to get through. I mainly try to see the same doctor if I can because I feel that I do get better care that way. Generally its a pretty good surgery.
Hardwick,Real issues with medication,8/8/2022,2,It appears there is no auditing of the pharmacy process. I've been given completely the wrong medication on four occasions.  You never get any explanation for why the issues are occurring they just say it's been redone.  Apart from the cost of the medication that has been wrongly prescribed and then returned its frustrating that there doesn't appear a way for them to find out what is happening and how to prevent it.
Hardwick,Recent move has gone smoothly,4/13/2016,4,A family member accompanies me to appointments so that I fully understand what is being said. I recently moved to the surgery but have been able to get my medication as normal.
Hardwick,Recently improved,8/20/2021,4,I feel that it has recently improved as you can get an appointment more easily now. Phoning and speaking to a doctor has worked well this morning and resulted in me getting an appointment to see a doctor. I do feel that at the height of the pandemic it was more difficult to get seen.
Hardwick,Reception are helpful,8/20/2021,4,"I feel  get an appropriate appointment  when calling in, it can take some time to get through but it's not too bad really. Reception staff are really helpful but I do feel a face to face consultation would be better in some circumstances. The only thing I'd like to change is possibly the music on the phone line when you're waiting, something more calming would be nice."
Hardwick,Reception staff helpful,6/10/2016,5,Reception staff are helpful and the medical secretaries are great at helping to get things sorted. Because we have a car we can also get to the other surgery site.
Hardwick,Rudest receptionists I've ever encountered,8/17/2020,1,"The receptionists at all their surgeries make you feel like an inconvenience and ignore you whilst they stand there gossiping - absolutely terrible!  Some doctors are ok, but others are abrupt and condescending.  The surgeries are all a bit tatty and dated.  Even before Covid you had to wait ages to see anyone. The only good thing is that I don't have to go all that often!"
Hardwick,"Some good , some not.",8/25/2019,3,"Some GPs good, some not. Often the GP will ask you what you're in for and they have info on their own PCs."
Hardwick,Sometimes wait 3 weeks.,8/25/2019,5,"The appointment times can be slow, sometimes wait 3 weeks before I get to see the doctor."
Hardwick,Staff are friendly,3/2/2017,5,Staff are friendly and I don't have problems getting appointments. I don't like only being able to do on the day appointments only.  It's frustrating and you don't always get an appointment when you need one.  In an urgent situation they have made sure I got an appointment
Hardwick,Staff are great,11/24/2021,5,Booking for my flu vaccination was simple and all done through the surgery. Staff are great when you speak to them and having the dispensary at the surgery makes it so much easier.
Hardwick,Staff are great,8/20/2021,4,"Staff are very helpful, I do find it is a bit difficult to get a face to face appointment at times, however over covid I've had the doctor visit me at home which was great."
Hardwick,Staff are helpful,8/20/2021,4,"I'm finding it fine to get through to the surgery and get an appointment which is always the most appropriate, when I need one. When I've had contact with staff they've always be fine to deal with and helpful."
Hardwick,Staff are lovely,8/8/2022,4,Absolutely no problems getting appointments by phone and the staff are lovely. I have an appointment with a GP not mine but I'm happy with that as they are all great.
Hardwick,Staff at Cornard very good,8/30/2018,5,"I like having the choice of surgery to attend and normally it means that you can be seen on the day. Staff at the Cornard surgery are very good and helpful nothing is too much trouble. The text reminders work well too. They've treated our mum with the up most respect, good holistic care."
Hardwick,Staff brilliant,5/12/2022,3,"Staff here are brilliant but it is difficult to get appointments and getting through on the phone which is the biggest problem as you have to keep calling back as you can't even join the queue. Today I got an emergency appointment easily with a doctor but in the past it's not been easy. I have had great ongoing support from a number of individual doctors,  with regular call backs each week for a month though."
Hardwick,Staff friendly,8/25/2019,4,Booking appointment on the phone can be very off-putting. Once was 23rd in the queue. Mixed feelings about the care navigator role regarding confidentiality. Staff friendly and helpful. Treatment generally excellent.
Hardwick,Staff friendly,8/25/2019,5,Staff friendly and accommodating and helpful
Hardwick,Staff friendly,10/12/2018,5,"I'd rather see the same doctor each time but staff are friendly and approachable. I pick up my medications, they are available quickly and it helps having the longer hours during the week to be able to pick them up. Having the different surgery sites means you can have an appointment when it suits."
Hardwick,Staff very good,5/12/2022,4,"Would prefer to be able to book appointments slightly further ahead. I called yesterday and spoke to a GP who then arranged for me to see a specific GP today. The staff, doctors and nurses are very good but the phones are busy and you do have to wait a fair amount of time."
Hardwick,Staff were helpful,8/20/2021,4,"Called Meadow Lane surgery and was given an appointment this morning and didn't have to be on the phone too long which was great. Reception were able to book me an appointment straightaway. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, really great."
Hardwick,Support received is inadequate,6/21/2018,2,"Don't really feel my daughter gets the support she needs from the surgery, just seems she is fobbed off."
Hardwick,Surgery can be very hot at times,6/4/2018,3,"Alright surgery, always very hot in the surgery and always have to wait for your appointment. Everyone is friendly and give you enough information. Appointments are ok to book."
Hardwick,Surgery is great,8/20/2021,5,"100% they are really great. The phone line wait can be a bit long, may be a few minutes but I'm happy that I can get an appointment when I need one. Nurses make sure that I have my regular asthma checks and generally staff are great and"
Hardwick,Surgery is great,6/10/2016,5,The surgery is great I've been there for many years and have never had any issues.
Hardwick,Takes more time to see someone specific,10/12/2018,5,Generally you can get an appointment when needed but if you want to see someone specific it takes a little more time. Staff are friendly and helpful.
Hardwick,Takes too long to get through,2/3/2022,4,It took me an hour this morning to get through on the phone it causes me to be very stressed.
Hardwick,telephone answering very slow,7/4/2016,4,The telephone answering is very slow. The receptionists do not always acknowledge you when you are waiting. Not told when things are running late.
Hardwick,The doctor is very understanding,6/21/2018,5,"The doctor I see is very understanding, she listens to everything you are saying and that you're important."
Hardwick,The surgery is good,1/9/2016,5,The surgery is good and the doctors are great and very approachable
Hardwick,They always have time for us,2/3/2022,5,Response time is fantastic. They always have time for us. I never feel rushed and they explain things well and give recommendations. I dont have any problems getting an appointment waiting only about 10 mins on the phone. I cannot fault them and they are great with my young son.
Hardwick,They can usually fit me in,2/3/2022,3,The surgery phoned me on this occasion for my appointment. I find they can usually fit me in when I need to see someone. The staff attitude is good.
Hardwick,They have improved of late,4/10/2015,3,They have improved of late.
Hardwick,They make sure I understand everything,3/2/2017,5,I see the same doctor and go to appointments with my support worker.  The doctors talk to me and my support worker to make sure I understand everything
Hardwick,They will always find a Dr for you to see.,8/12/2017,5,They will always find a doctor for you to see at one of the surgeries. Very good.
Hardwick,Thorough and patient,11/17/2020,5,Doctor saw my elderly mother urgently. Very kind and patient with her. Thorough investigations organised urgently
Hardwick,Unable to book an appointment,12/13/2022,1,"I tried ringing the surgery at 8 am, but by then the surgery telephones would not even let you queue.  Kept calling back to eventually hear an automated voice saying I was number 60 in the queue! I tried to book using the online form but this does not appear to be available on the Hardwicke site.  I guess I will just have to join in again tomorrow morning.  I am reasonably confident, but all I can think is what about the more vulnerable people who use the service?"
Hardwick,Unable to book appointment for a child,6/9/2021,1,"I contacted the surgery at 9:30am and after waiting 10 minutes on the phone I was advised that I would have to phone back the following day at 8am to book an appointment for my son, as there were no appointments available for today."
Hardwick,Understanding,11/12/2015,5,The doctor was understanding and the waiting room was quiet.
Hardwick,Very busy surgery,12/19/2018,3,"When you call you are asked to call back the next day or even the next, if you don't get one the next day. You can only book urgent appointments 'on the day' which is difficult considering how busy they are. When you can get in they are normally very good, I do feel that one of the doctors doesn't listen very well though."
Hardwick,Very efficient,8/25/2019,4,Always very efficient. I am deaf and the staff are very helpful with this.
Hardwick,Very good,2/28/2023,5,I can only say how good they have been at this surgery to both myself and my husband. My husband had bowel cancer and the GP sent him to Addenbrokes for further treatment.
Hardwick,Very good,6/11/2015,5,The doctor understood my husband's condition and very kindly saw us early to ensure he did not become anxious.  We arrived a little early and went in early.  This was very good treatment and we were very impressed.
Hardwick,Very good,9/10/2015,5,Very helpful and informative.
Hardwick,Very good,8/27/2015,5,I very rarely visit the doctor but when I do everything is great
Hardwick,Very good all through my recovery.,2/21/2017,5,The GPs always come out to me when I need them and they have been very good all through my recovery
Hardwick,Very happy,11/24/2021,5,"Econsult for me works really well and I've been contacted within the time frames stated, which has resulted in appropriate care and treatment. I did recently try to get through to the dispensary but the phone for some reason kept going back to reception so that was a bit difficult but may be there was a fault or they were busy.  The staff are very patient and helpful."
Hardwick,Very happy,8/25/2019,5,"Very happy with this surgery, no issues. I find them to be accommodating with appointment. Staff are friendly and try their best. Wish the car park was bigger."
Hardwick,Very helpful,8/25/2019,5,Staff very helpful with appointments to see nurse.
Hardwick,Very helpful staff,11/24/2021,5,"Never had any issues, normally I call for an appointment and haven't had to wait too long either. Staff are very helpful and the clinical staff are good at explaining things."
Hardwick,Very nice,8/25/2019,4,Very nice receptionists.
Hardwick,Very obliging,11/24/2021,5,"I generally call to get appointments and the surgery are very obliging when trying to arrange them. The staff are very nice and I have no problems at the surgery at all, it all works well for me."
Hardwick,Very professional and caring,11/15/2019,5,Have always managed to speak to a doctor who will arrange an appointment for the same day. Very professional and caring. Everybody goes the extra mile to solve the health issue.
Hardwick,Very time driven and unpleasant experience,8/16/2017,1,"Many of the GP's I have met there are in a hurry, judgemental, unprepared and do not seem interested in how I feel, nor do they want to listen to what I have to say. Their main concern seems to be with the computer and how much time they have. Very dystopian and uncaring attitudes."
Hardwick,waits can be quite long,12/8/2016,4,The wait for our last appointment was quite long which can be difficult for my wife who has dementia. To see the same doctor we do have to visit the Clare surgery on occasions .
Hardwick,Way too long a wait,8/25/2019,4,"Waiting for follow up appointments for baby 2-3 weeks. Way too long. Do not like care navigator system, giving the wrong information is a real concern for me."
Hardwick,We are lucky,8/8/2022,4,"Generally we are very lucky with the surgery as we can get in when needed. E consult is handy to have for appointments but depending on the situation it can be easier to call the surgery, however, the phones and calling the surgery at 8am is the only real issue due to the time it can take."
Hardwick,Wonderful,8/25/2019,5,"Recently moved, find service to be wonderful."
Hardwick,Wonderful doctor,8/12/2022,4,Feel very supported by my GP especially around my anxiety. I speak regularly every three weeks and then see them once a month. Appointments are flexible and they try to arrange them when other things are happening for me which is great.
Hardwick,Working well,8/20/2021,4,The system in place to get appointments is working well and allows me to get appointments when I need them. Staff are generally friendly but I do worry about the closure of the Great Cornard branch with the proposed development of the new health centre.
Hardwick,Works quite well,11/19/2021,4,Generally works quite well but I have used the econsult system after calling the surgery and being told to do one. Unfortunately I was then told by the system that I should speak to my doctor . The system obviously thought I needed to be seen due to the answers I was giving and therefore wouldn't allow me to complete the submission. I then called the surgery but they were unable to help  as there were no appointments available so I was advised to call back in the morning. In the end after calling to try and get an appointment it has taken 2 weeks to be seen face to face and get things sorted.
Hardwick,Works well,8/8/2022,5,I started calling at 8am this morning but was cut off a few times before I joined the queue. I got through in the end and was given an appointment so it has all worked well today. The staff are lovely too.
Hardwick,Works well,11/24/2021,4,"I generally find that the surgery works very well for me, I suppose that they could be a bit quicker to see people at times."
Hardwick,Works well,11/24/2021,4,Getting through on the phone can be difficult but the wait isn't too long. I've had phone consultations which have worked well and I've not needed to see someone face to face. Staff are all friendly and explain things very well.
Hardwick,You have to wait to get an appointment,8/9/2016,1,Disappointed they won't let L & D nurse in practice.  Also waiting times to get an appointment
Haven,A very efficient surgery.,7/16/2015,4,A very efficient surgery.
Haven,A veteran here!,9/13/2018,5,"I find the surgery excellent, and have done, all the years I have been a patient here. I am a veteran, and I appreciate how respectful they are to me as a much older person. They talk clearly, as I have hearing trouble."
Haven,Always helpful.,2/10/2020,5,Never had a bad experience always willing to help.
Haven,Always polite here,9/13/2018,5,"They are always very polite here.  My dedicated Doctor is very good, listens well and treats me holistically.  Other GP's, not so much.  I have had referrals to the Pain Clinic and Neurology which has helped immensely with the mental side of things."
Haven,Amazing friendly and helpful staff,8/23/2020,5,as a patient with complex medical needs im a regular i have 100% trust in all the staff they are all so caring and do their upmost to support me in everyday possible i can not thank them enough
Haven,Amazing staff always happy to help,4/23/2020,5,I have complex medical needs and haven health are incredible i can not recommend the place highly enough
Haven,Appointment choice good,9/13/2018,5,Really cannot fault the surgery. In my limited experience they treat you well. I get an appointment when needed. You get the choice to book ahead or on the day which works well.
Haven,Appointments available,8/23/2018,4,"Generally don't go very often, but when I do I can get appointments as and when the children need to be seen."
Haven,AskMyGP - Great!,9/9/2022,5,"Find the surgery excellent and have managed to use AskMyGP. I found it easy to use and register on. Today is my first time using it and I got an appointment today, so cannot say anything but positive things about the service on that basis. I used to use the telephone which takes longer to get through on, so I will definitely try it again."
Haven,AskMyGP is great,9/9/2022,5,"Since the launch of AskMyGP I have been able to get better access to what I need. I have found it very responsive and as it is easy to use it really makes sense to me to use it. I have an appointment today on the day that I put it in, but other submissions have led to phone calls and some just to information, which has all been appropriate each time."
Haven,Been  with Haven Health a long time,8/20/2020,5,I have never had any reason to think about leaving always been very helpful  and cheerful  thank you
Haven,Best doctors,10/11/2020,5,I received excellent care following a stroke and the support and care shown to my husband and family from diagnosis to his passing and since has been amazing
Haven,Blood test on site is convenient,9/13/2018,4,In general good things are that you get an appointment when you need one and can book in advance too.  Blood tests on site is very convenient.  My only wish would be to see the same GP as I have a heart condition. I had a quadruple bypass last year and if I end up seeing a locum you have to re-tell them everything.
Haven,Brilliant service,6/15/2022,5,I cannot speak highly enough about the excellent service I receive from this surgery. Thank you to everyone involved.
Haven,Brilliant so far,9/9/2022,5,New to the surgery and it has been brilliant. We have had 6 appointments by using AskMyGP. Really like the system as you can do it when convenient to you and we have always had a response the same day.
Haven,Call back non existent,3/10/2020,1,Wanting a prescription renewed cannot get through on the phone haven health is worse than my old surgery
Haven,Cannot fault service,8/11/2021,5,"I cannot fault this service.  Moved in to the area and to this surgery a few weeks back. They noted that at my previous surgery I was due to have an appointment linked to my health condition and said to me that they could sort that out really quickly, which they did, and I was in within a few days. I really cannot fault them."
Haven,"Cant get appointments with gp, dont bother",9/20/2021,1,"Get calls from nurse (name removed) when u need to speak with doctor as them have more scope to deal with complex problems  , having nurse (name removed) call today was waste of time as he was duty gp, he not qualified at that level, useless"
Haven,"Changed to this practice,best move ever made",1/21/2021,5,I was fed up at my previous practice with being unable to arrange an appointment unless the doctor thought it ‘absolutely necessary’.  Find this practice much easier and friendly.  Highly recommend them.
Haven,Chasing up my prescription,12/8/2020,5,"Reception call handling was amazing.  I am giving up smoking. My tablets run out on Friday. I phoned yesterday spoke to someone else who told me my repeat wasn't there,didn't bother trying to find out as Onelife Suffolk had actually requested it on 5th August. Onelife told me to call today. Thank goodness they were on the phone, they made me feel supported, bothered about and after calling back a couple if times they made sure I had my repeat by Friday. They understood my need as a smoker to keep going with the strides I have made in quitting over past 11 days and how important it was for me  to achieve my goal to quit. Yesterday experience left me cold. Thank you so much,your kindness lifted my spirits."
Haven,Choice is good,2/25/2019,4,I appreciate the option of 'on the day' and 'advanced' appointments.  Advanced ones though are much further in the future than you'd like.  You feel like having to ask for an 'on the day' one as they are so far away
Haven,Community Midwife access good here,8/11/2018,4,"The reception team can be rude, depends who you get.  But I get an appointment when I need one.
Whilst pregnant I was able to see my community midwife here which is very convenient.  I did find seeing 4 different midwives difficult as you felt that no one really knew me."
Haven,Complicated letter explained,9/13/2018,3,"After major surgery in Ipswich hospital, a letter was written to me from the hospital and it was in language that I did not understand (very technical terms). I could not tell if I was fully clear of problems or not. The surgery GP met with me and explained it all. There are in fact a couple of issues and I am now on medication relating to those."
Haven,Computer system,9/13/2018,4,"I prefer the older computer system. There has been some issues with things and we have had support over the telephone. We cannot order prescriptions as far in advance as we used to. This can be annoying as you may not be free to do the order when it is specifically needed, and you can forget, which then causes delays in getting the medication."
Haven,Confidentiality is an issue at front desk,9/13/2018,4,"Sitting in the waiting room, you can hear the calls coming in and today I clearly heard them trying to find a patient on the system. They said their name and Date of Birth out loud. They had got the year wrong, which was why they could not find them on the system. Perhaps calls should be answered out the back.When people walk in, they should ask them to write it down."
Haven,Didn't see who I thought,2/25/2019,4,"Seen not necessarily by who I think or prefer to see.  Staff I feel could explain a bit better as their responses to what you are asking when you call up can be a bit sharp, rather than being conversational. Just feels defensive."
Haven,Difficult to fault it,9/13/2018,5,"Really cannot fault the surgery. I have not been here long, but they treat you well. I get an appointment when I have needed one. I have booked ahead when it was not urgent, but also when it was, I got an appointment on the day I had called."
Haven,Easier to get appointment,9/13/2018,5,"I have moved nearer this surgery, so recently changed from The Grove, where getting an appointment was quite difficult. My experience here so far is excellent (only used it twice)."
Haven,Excellent,1/11/2019,4,"Been under surgery for an number of years and it was excellent but feel it has not continued in the same standard recently . GPs are more difficult to get due to a shortage. I find it good here though, that they are a ""training practice""."
Haven,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Everything is excellent here. I can get an appointment easily and the staff are very kind. I get to see the same GP most of the time, and nurses when that is more appropriate."
Haven,Excellent,7/9/2017,5,"I generally see the same GP and know that is quite fortunate.  This is mainly because my appointments are booked in advance. I would not expect the same if I rang on the day, but I understand that"
Haven,Excellent,7/9/2017,5,I rang today and have been able to get an appointment straight away.  I do not have any faults to mention about the surgery
Haven,excellent,12/4/2016,5,Always very kind
Haven,Excellent - got an appointment straight away,7/9/2017,5,Called on the day today and was able to to get in straight away to see a GP
Haven,Excellent and can always get an appointment on the day,10/4/2017,5,I always get an appointment on the day
Haven,Excellent but appointments always run late,10/4/2017,5,"Good surgery,but appointments never run on time. Today we were early and so I'm sitting with a child for more than 30 minutes,which is difficult to manage."
Haven,Excellent but appointments don't run on time.,10/4/2017,5,Generally good service.  Just find appointments do not run on time
Haven,Excellent but appointments never on time.,10/4/2017,5,"Appointments never run on time,but I always get one when I need it.  Can be hard if I am working that day"
Haven,Excellent ongoing care for child,4/2/2020,5,"Were excellent with my child for a good couple of years who had need to come regularly with a 'life-long' condition in need 'on & off' to go into hospital.  They saved his life really, with good quick thinking we accessed the service quickly, starting all of course with quick access to the surgery and getting linked up to the appropriate services at the hospital"
Haven,Excellent practice. Staff very helpful,7/14/2016,5,"All staff engaged in a professional,caring and helpful manner.So pleased we transferred to this practice"
Haven,Excellent service,12/14/2021,5,Transferred from Cambridgeshire to this surgery with a few health issues. Was seen almost immediately and reassured and dealt with. I have recieved phone calls checking my medication progress. I have every confidence in the GP and nurse practioner. Would highly recommend
Haven,Extra support given when needed,10/5/2016,5,A couple with a learning difficulty means they need a little extra support on some occasions. They are always very good. The man had to have an extra tablet and it was very well explained why this was needed.
Haven,Fair,7/9/2017,3,My surgery for some time now.  Most surgeries are in the same boat.  Patients' expectations need to be lowered now to fit into what can actuallybe delivered.  It is not the same anymore
Haven,fair,12/4/2016,3,Takes ages to get an appointment
Haven,Fair. Don't always see the same GP.,7/9/2017,3,Nurses are more prompt than GPs.  Don't always see my own GP even when booking in advance.  It would be a month.  So seeing someone different today but feel I will need to explain everything again as he won't be familiar with full condition and treatment
Haven,Fair. Long waits and a mistake with booking an appointment,7/9/2017,3,"Having always to wait for more than 20 minutes when I have an appointment.  With a new born baby needing feeding I time things to fit in with that.  The screen used to tell us what the time delay is for appointments, but since having a new screen it does not tell you. Just checked with reception about how long the delay is and I was told that the person I'm seeing is off sick and the screen had allowed me to book when it should not have allowed me to book when it should not have done so"
Haven,Fantastic staff always helpful,4/4/2022,5,Following the closure of my last surgery and having been a patient there for over 30 years I was sad to have choose another surgery and registered with Haven health surgery and can honestly say that all contact has been a very positive experience with helpful pleasant staff who support me to manage my heath conditions
Haven,Fast referral & medication management,5/29/2021,5,"My daughter had been unwell; I phoned the surgery and a doctor called back within the hour. She listened, asked very thorough questions and then advised I took my daughter straight to hospital. 

A letter for the hospital was ready for me to collect immediately, we arrived at the hospital and stayed for 8 days! I would like to say thank you so much to the doctor who I spoke to, I cannot remember her name but believe her to be a locum. We now have an onward treatment plan for my daughter thanks to the Dr's knowledge. 

The receptionists have also been so helpful with appointments, results and medication. I truly am grateful to have such an efficient, supportive and caring practice."
Haven,Flu jab given,12/22/2020,5,The procedures in place were effective.
Haven,Friendly and efficient,10/5/2023,4,I have used the online Ask my GP and it seemed to work well and the response from the surgery was pretty good. I have also had a good referral from the surgery. I find the staff to be friendly and efficient.
Haven,Getting through difficult,2/19/2019,4,"The surgery is relatively easy to access when I need a routine appointment. I do not call them until later in the day for that, so you get through fine.  However, it is very different getting through at 8am, and I understand things are busy in the morning, but that is the time you are told to call, so I would hope that more staff can be answering the phone.  It can be stressful as I have a baby and so its difficult when you are hitting redial a lot or waiting in the queue for ages.  However, I do not know the answer."
Haven,Good,10/16/2017,5,Haven health is a very caring and diabetes aware GP practice.  Their recent change of IT system to align with partner practices has reduced the functionality available to me
Haven,Good,7/9/2017,4,I have had to go to the hospital after 3 pm for an appointment.  The service was fine but it felt strange.  It is something I didn't know about so found it an unusual thing.  But now I know 'why' I will be better mentally prepared if I have to do that again
Haven,Good,7/9/2017,4,This surgery has always met my needs. Nothing is ever perfect; that is impossible in this day and age.  I only see a GP when I absolutely need to and wish others would do the same then perhaps there would be less stress
Haven,Good,10/4/2017,4,Overall very good service
Haven,Good,2/3/2017,4,"There is one member of staff, a receptionist, who is quite rude most of the time.  My daughteris very reluctant to phone for an appointment.  I have to do it for her. this should not be.  Rest of staff are very nice"
Haven,Good,7/3/2019,4,Good care if I can see my own dr. Good care from my practice nurse. Up to 3 weeks to get an appointment
Haven,Good and can get appointment when needed,10/4/2017,4,A good local practice that I do not currently use very much; but when I need an appointment I usually get one
Haven,Good and usually get appointments when needed,10/4/2017,4,"Generally very good, as I get appointments when needed"
Haven,Good but appointments rarely run on time,7/9/2017,4,Front desk staff are variable; it just depends who is on duty. My appointments rarely run on time either.  It would be good if there was a notice to say how late the appointments are running
Haven,Good but appointments run late,10/4/2017,4,Often running late. 25 minutes today
Haven,Good but hard getting a 'phone appointment.,7/9/2017,4,If I need an appointment I have taken to turning up at the door at 8 am instead of telephoning in as it is just too stressful trying to get through.  Most of the staff are lovely but I do find this can vary.
Haven,Good but long waiting times,7/9/2017,4,Not always running on time.  I've waited 40 minutes today which at 10.0 I find unacceptable.  I wish there were later clinics for workers.  I did not know about GP+ appointments and would ask for one in the future
Haven,Good but long waiting times,10/4/2017,4,Sitting past my appointment for 40 minutes already
Haven,Good but near impossible to get 'on the day' appointments,7/9/2017,4,On the day appointments are near on impossible to get.  Advanced appointments stil don't run on time unless you are seeing a nurse.
Haven,Good but no afternoon appointments is not welcome,10/4/2017,4,"Horrified to hear that from  pm no appointments at my practice are available and that this gradually moving forward to 1 pm!  What are staff going to be doing from 1 pm. every day?  I will be looking into morning surgeries,  I need continuity of care."
Haven,Good but online registration was challenging,7/9/2017,4,Recently having to register online was challenging to navigate as I am not very computer literate
Haven,Good but rarely use it,10/4/2017,4,A good surgery that I rarely use.  I did not know about the collaboration as I barely come here but it hasn't yet affected me.  If I was in Walton I would be grateful for it
Haven,Good but service does run late at times,10/4/2017,4,"I like it that the GP comes out to get me and it's not the screen/beep system.  Much more personal this way.   Always liked the service, though it does run a bit late most of the time"
Haven,Good but surgeries always run late,7/9/2017,4,Running 50 minutes late today. It always runs late.  Feel anxious already so this does not help
Haven,Good but surgery needs a spruce up,7/9/2017,4,Surgery needs a bit of a spruce up
Haven,Good but waiting times are often long,7/9/2017,4,"I do not use the surgery very often,  My appointments rarely run on time.  I think they need to inform you how far behind they are so you can decide whether to stay or go,"
Haven,Good coordination,9/13/2018,5,Always had appointments when needed. They coordinate my blood test on site to link up with seeing the GP 10 days afterwards.  Very good and convenient service
Haven,Good for all the family,10/2/2020,4,Managed to get appointment today by ringing in this morning.  I do find it a very good surgery as we do get seen across the family when we need to.
Haven,Good service,2/25/2019,4,I have found this is a good service since I moved to this area 6 months ago.  Can sometimes run behind at appointments.
Haven,Good. I like my GP but there is another who has a poor attitude,7/9/2017,4,"I really like my female GP but dislike the the attitude of another GP whose bedside manner is not great.  I would not open up to him about much, which is not an ideal situation"
Haven,Good. Staff are lovely.,7/9/2017,4,Depends on individual GP whether I get a good explanation.  Staff are lovely and always amenable. I never see the same GP but I do not mind.  I moved from Howard House as I did not like their appointments system
Haven,Good. Supportive GP,7/9/2017,4,"Really good support from the GP, especially around mental health as it's about 6 month wait to access the wellbeing service. So having an understanding GP with a listening ear has been great"
Haven,Good. Usually get to see my own GP,10/4/2017,4,I like this surgery and get to see my own GP most of the time.  Appointments do run a bit late most of the time
Haven,Got appointment,1/11/2019,4,"Got appointment today after being 10th in the queue, so wss pleased and so get to see my GP. Do however feel that I am being palmed off. Asked to go swimming, but cannot cannot due to hyper mobility issues. Medication is not agreeing with me, so I am here to hopefully sort that"
Haven,Got nowhere on internet,6/24/2022,2,"Was told to use the internet after two phone calls waiting in the queue and getting nowhere. I can use the internet, but it got me nowhere still. A friend ended up ringing on my behalf as I was frustrated and I did see a nurse in the end, it just took a long time to sort this out which is frustrating."
Haven,Great service,2/25/2019,5,I find getting and appointment easy and all the staff are caring and helpful.  Been here many years and it has been consistently good for me and my family.
Haven,"Great service, shame about the mess outside.",5/28/2021,5,"In these times when we are trying to keep Felixstowe litter free, it would be nice to see some effort made outside the surgery. I understand you are near a school and supermarket, and we have coastal winds, but please, just daily clear the litter."
Haven,Haven Health,1/11/2019,5,Access has gotten harder but always treated me very well. I have seen nurses and GPs and they are lovely. Reception staff are also excellent. My main issue here is patient confidentiality at the front desk. You are very exposed and distance between front door and desk makes queuing difficult.
Haven,Helpful sorting my meds,8/11/2021,5,"I came in today as been having issues around my prescription and that of my partners too. The staff sorted everything out quickly, gave me all the information I needed. The paperwork though, may take a month to sort out apparently."
Haven,Hit and miss,7/13/2020,3,One of the receptionists is so miserable and you really feel that you just shouldn’t bother. All the nurses are great as is my doctor. Getting an appointment seems harder than a year ago though
Haven,I am seen regularly,10/2/2020,5,"I am always see me when I need it as an older person with numerous conditions, and come in every couple of weeks for blood tests, which I access easily as booked ahead of time.
They also sorted out my medication when the hospital made a mistake.  I have dossett boxes and was told to only have the tablets allocated in the boxes. 2 weeks on from this I had progressive issues with my legs blowing up and when I got to see my GP we realised that my 'water' tablet was not in the dossett boxes but in a separate bag on its own.  We did get it sorted from that moment thanks to getting to see the GP on that occasion."
Haven,I miss not having regular dr who knows about,8/21/2020,3,I phoned to tell the surgery change of address and was told to go entrance and fill form in .I dont live near surgery and do shift work dont drive so its easier over the phone .
Haven,Lovely team,10/2/2020,5,"I have been here a number of years and I find the majority of the team here very helpful and show good care.  I tend to come in first thing on the day I wish to see someone and depending on who you get on reception initially, your welcome can vary. After that though you tend to see the right medical person, and only once have I been asked to try the Pharmacy first, which I went to, and they said that I needed to see the GP for it, which was frustrating."
Haven,Lucky to have this service,2/19/2019,5,"This is the best Doctors surgery I have been to.  I think that I am so lucky to have such a good service.  Kind staff, caring clinical staff and feel confident that they know what they are doing.  Access has been fine for me."
Haven,Miserable receptionist,10/2/2020,3,"One particular receptionist each time I see her either at the desk or talks to me on telephone I find her just rude and miserable looking.  I called for appointment a couple of Tuesdays ago and got told I could go to the hospital on Saturday.  I decided to not take that appointment, so after queueing up this morning I am here for same issue and seeing a Nurse, which is fine.  But she is sitting there, still not cracking a smile."
Haven,More difficult to get appointments,4/2/2020,4,"We are finding it more difficult to get appointments.  First appointment available today was 11am, when we got through at 8.15 am.  We do onder how the system overall works.  Are there some pre-booked ones that GP's are seeing first thing? - CDO explained the doctors call back people and manage their own patient appointments that day.  There may be a percentage of appointments allocated to 'pre-booked', but the patient should enquire from the practice for details if at all concerned how the allocation works."
Haven,Moved from The Grove,9/13/2018,5,"We moved to this surgery from The Grove as we could barely ever get an appointment. Here we get one when we need one, and we find the reception staff excellent.  They seem to take their time with you. Never brusk like some can be in other places we have been, and they are so busy, so it is appreciated all the more."
Haven,My daughters in unnecessary pain for months,3/29/2021,1,My toddlers been constipated for several months and have been given medication for it but never any follow ups. Shes ran out of one of the medicines but osnt being given anymore and we had a trip to a&e today because shes in so much pain. A doctor at the hospital said she needs a stronger medicine and our gp is useless. Lost all faith in gps
Haven,Need help with AskMyGP,9/9/2022,4,I tried using AskMyGP but I am having issues with it. Reception say I am on it but I cannot get in. (CDO helped with navigating it and it turned out that you have to register even when reception may have put something in for you before). I feel they need to be aware of this as they told me I was on the system.
Haven,Need to come out to get me,9/9/2022,3,"When I initially contacted the surgery in the early days of AskMyGP, the receptionist got stroppy with me about using it. I stated that I could barely see so it does not work for everyone. No apology! They did sort it out and had to fill it in on my behalf.
There does not seem to be a link up then to the clinician when I come in. I was told they would come out and get me, they did not and when my name came up on a screen that I cannot see, the Healthwatch person asked if my name was ....... and they then knew they had been called. I knew the general direction I had to go in. Should have something on my record to know this already really, so they can come out and get me."
Haven,No fault,2/19/2019,5,"I honestly cannot fault the service I have had here.  Staff are good and kind.  Yes it takes a while to get through on the telephone, but that is normal and to be expected when demand is high, which it will be in the morning.  Perhaps they could say to people who wish to book routine appointments to call later in the morning, which will help ease up the lines first thing."
Haven,No information. Felt stranded,10/11/2017,5,"This surgery on all counts so far has been excellent. However, when we received the diagnosis of Vascular Dementia after a brain scan the specialist was not very helpful making a joke of making sure i 'never disagree with my partner'. We then saw our GP but no information was given. We found the Sue Ryder 'Dementia together' service ourselves. Being told that the GP should have given us that information was surprising. Since going there they have been very supportive and just what we need. thankfully we found them or we would have felt stranded."
Haven,No problems,9/13/2018,4,"I do not have any problems with this surgery. Today my appointment is 30 minutes late, but I have plenty of time and so it does not bother me."
Haven,Not very happy,1/11/2019,3,"Not very happy right now as I called the surgery last week around 12 noon. Told I'd get a callback and it did not happen, so at the end of the surgery I walked in and am told I'd had a callback around 10am. Which is not true as I hadn't rung in until noon! I then asked if an appointment could be made and was told they cannot do that. However, whilst in someone else was able to make an appointment for another day so it can be done. They are taking my issue seriously as I have an appointment to see the practice manager."
Haven,Overall very happy,9/13/2018,5,I am very happy with this surgery. I can get an appointment when I need on quite easily. The staff are always polite and caring
Haven,"Phone consults that dont happen,",9/18/2020,1,"consult booked but calls never came, asthma review with nurse at surgery cancelled by surgery 45mins before appointment,  told will get call next day from someone else less experienced instead, not good enough"
Haven,Phone hung up when NO1 in queue,2/19/2019,4,Being able to make an appointment is very difficult and often when ringing at 8 am the 'phone is put down when you have waited in the line and finally got to NO1 in the queue.  Unable to book in advance and are told to ring again the next day.
Haven,Poor,5/2/2016,1,The doctor didn't examine my shoulder where I was in discomfort  so I wasn't told what it was.  I have now to make an appointment with a nurse so I know what's the matter.  Staff were really nasty to me and upset me
Haven,poor attitude,3/25/2022,2,"receptionist refusing to take telephone call appointment insisting to use askmygp, which I said I was unable to. I insisted on call from doctor. When GP finally called didn't offer to see me, just telephone consultation, even though an ear issue with history but still didn't want to see me."
Haven,Poor. Cannot get same day appointment and waited for help when feeling very ill.,1/8/2017,1,Just cannot get a GP on the same day. I had a call 5 hours later & I felt I was having symptoms of a stroke!
Haven,Poor. Surgery unclean hard to get appointment on the day,7/9/2017,2,Surgery looks like it needs a deep clean.  Once had a telephone appointment with a GP. who was unfamiliar with something new that was wrong.  I was prescribed over the telephone for something I felt needed a face to face consultation.  Getting an appointment on the day is difficult with own GP.  However an advanced one does work
Haven,Queuing on phone often too long,8/20/2020,4,"Doctors,Nurses and Receptionists Excellent. Same day walk in service for any doctor or nurse essential.Same day appointment for specific doctor or nurse essential. Advanced appointment system for any time up yo 1 year important."
Haven,Quick & efficient with prompt call back!,1/11/2020,5,"Great online symptom checker, quick call back from doctor and prescription sent to local pharmacy...excellent!"
Haven,Rarely use,2/25/2019,3,"Just based on today - access to this appointment was, I felt more difficult to obtain than I expected, however I got one, so I am pleased.
Very rarely use (luckily) - only 1st proper appointment since moving here 3 years ago so unable to comment further."
Haven,Really excellent surgery,9/13/2018,5,"Many appointment options here. I have had advanced ones, 'on the day' ones and so it is good to have that choice. Some places do not offer that.  It has also been good when I have had the GP call me back, when I was unsure about something"
Haven,Reception could be friendly more,12/17/2020,5,"I went into this surgery to register as a new patient and I moved back to the area, I spoke with one person who was working as a reception who was very helpful and the other one came across very rude"
Haven,Registration access to online booking service,8/17/2020,1,Trying to get my wife registered with the online booking system. Link to download online booking form on https://www.havenhealth.nhs.uk/appointments/scheduling-appointment doesn't work.
Haven,Reliable and efficient,7/9/2017,5,I find the surgery very reliable and efficient
Haven,round in circles,8/17/2021,3,"Spoken over a few weeks to 3 seperate GP's. I have been asked to go to 3 different places for tests and 2 of them are complete, which have come back negative, but no follow up. I want to know 'so what next?' I do not feel listened to as my pain does not relate to my stomach and that is what they are focusing on. I just want to be listened to and for us to stop going round in circles, shoved from pillar to post, it is just wasting everyone's time."
Haven,Rude and unhelpful,10/18/2019,1,"Had a letter asking us to book an appointment for our 2 1/2 year old to have his flu vaccination. Phone up to book appointment after waiting on hold for 20 minutes call gets answered I explain why I’m calling and get put on hold while the receptionist goes to check something. Another receptionist picks up the call thinking I’m someone else (possibly data breach there!). Once she worked out I wasn’t the person she was talking to she said that she would help me, so I explained again why I called, this time I didn’t get to the end of my sentence before being told that we don’t have any of the vaccine and don’t know when we are going to get any. Why didn’t you look on our website before calling it’s all on there. She then hangs up on me. I’ve checked the website nothing on there about children’s flu vaccinations only 65+ and 18+. So our little boy, who has some health issues, can’t get a vaccination that we were sent a letter from the NHS telling us to book an appointment for as the vaccination is now available."
Haven,Satisfactory,1/11/2019,5,"Called today for child to get appointment for them. Cannot ask for much more than that. Do not use very much, but when we have, all very satisfactory."
Haven,Saved a hospital visit,8/11/2021,5,"They sent their paramedic out to me recently, as I had some concerning signs of potential sepsis.  As I was on medication for something else I had not thought of taking anything else but the paramedic sorted out the paracetamol to bring my temperature down. This prevented me ending up in hospital, of that I have no doubt, so I am very grateful for this serivce."
Haven,Staff all very competent friendly and efficie,4/20/2018,5,I have always received good care from the whole team I feel they all talk to each other and the team are well led by experienced doctors
Haven,Staff here excellent,1/11/2019,5,"Called today and was 12th in the queue, but not able to get an appointment. Things have been difficult with my mental health and staff here have been excellent."
Haven,Surgery has always been great,8/11/2021,5,"This surgery has been great since being here for the last 2 years. I felt that I was treated badly at a previous Felixstowe practice and couldn't put up with it anymore, so came here and have never had a problem since. On a monthly check last week the Nurse picked up on something and got me into to see someone more specialised around it, which has only taken a few days to come back for, so this is in my books excellent"
Haven,System works ok for me,10/2/2020,4,"I have not always received an appointment when I felt I should be seeing a GP, however it works out fine seeing a Nurse Practitioner, and I am surprised to know everything they can do.  It would be good to make others more aware as it is clear that there are less appointments with GP's."
Haven,They are responsive,6/27/2023,5,"They are responsive I have found, they have been wonderful in the past 8 months when we really needed it. I have been very pleased with them as my surgery."
Haven,Timings of appointments & transportation,1/9/2015,3,Haven House Surgery knew my condition but still expected me to attend nurse appointments. Shouldn't they come to me and save my expensive taxi visits?
Haven,told me i had appointment but didnt book it,4/13/2023,2,"phoned up for a contraceptive injection 2 weeks ago, was told to use askmygp, put in a request on askmygp to which i was told that they’d booked me an appointment for today (thursday april 13th) at 8.20 am. i get to the surgery at 8.15, to be told i dont have an appointment at all let alone today. showed the receptionist my askmygp message telling me i had an appointment booked, receptionist walks off and returns a couple minutes later telling me i need to rebook because they never booked the appointment like they’d told me. Tried to book me in for over 2 weeks time, even though the injection was due today. it was a quick routine appointment and it was their mistake not mine, wouldnt see me this morning, reception staff were generally rude to me and told me i hadn’t booked my appointment even though i had the messages."
Haven,Too long to wait on phone,7/20/2021,2,Each call takes average 40 minutes in the queue whatever time you ring. GP don't follow up investigation results and get back to patients.
Haven,Treated nicely by all,8/11/2021,4,"I have had a number of regular visits here and to Felixstowe General Hospital, I need an ulcer on my leg monitored and dressing changed, All staff treat me nicely. I also feel safe coming into the surgery as it is a nice open space."
Haven,Triage with receptionist,7/12/2016,3,I don't like it that I have to tell reception what's wrong only then to get a call back at some time that day from the doctor only to have to repeat myself.What's the point of telling receptionists when they obviously make no notes to pass into the doctor which would surely mean when they ring you it would be a shorter call as they would already have most the information.
Haven,Very good,1/11/2019,4,"Find all the care very good and staff are on the front line, hearing any issues that patients have, but always good at handling things. Access however for a follow up appointment has taken 6 weeks. I am seeing a trainee with GP overseeing today."
Haven,Very good but sometimes a long wait for the GP,7/9/2017,5,Overall very good.  Waiting times can vary.  I have waited up to 50 minutes
Haven,Very happy with level of treatment,9/12/2022,5,The Doctor was extremely thorough and kind and genuinely seemed to care and took the time to ask so many questions to find the route of my problem.
Haven,Very helpful but some abrupt,10/2/2020,3,"The reception team can be lovely and can be very helpful, but if you get one particular one, there is a consistent abruptness. When you see her face to face, she is never smiling, and on the telephone everything seems so difficult, when you asking for the simplest things.  I understand it can be a difficult job, but if you are the first person someone sees you should be welcoming.  I know people have off days, but this person seems to have more than most!"
Haven,Walk-in to get appointment now,2/19/2019,4,"I walk-in to get appointments as I am nervous on the telephone.  They give you the option to write down what you would like to see the doctor about as it may be personal and do not want others to hear.  Think that is excellent thought, as I would not think to ask to do that."
Haven,Worlds worst doctors,10/29/2020,1,"I had to pay private for a blood test because they wouldn't listen to me. Upon receiving some of the results, they are still trying to tell me the reason I feel so ill is because I am depressed. They are doing repeat bloods which I have to wait 4 weeks for because they don't trust the ones I've already had. They have zero compassion or care so I had no choice but to go private. The doctor was rude and patronising and didn't listen to a word that I said. If you have a mental health record they will blame everything on that. I have never felt so unwell but apparently I'm just depressed. Its extremely worrying."
Haverhill,1 hour wait on the phone,2/21/2023,4,"Yesterday I had a 1 hour wait on the phone but there were no appointments available so I had to call back today and spent a further 40 minutes waiting but luckily this time I was able to get an appointment. Getting through to the surgery is the biggest issue, once in the care is good."
Haverhill,4 star,7/10/2015,4,4 star
Haverhill,A bit hit and miss,6/30/2022,4,Most contact with the doctors is by phone but don't usually have any issues with this and I'm happy with the staff when you do see them. I do find the triage process a bit drawn out.
Haverhill,A bit mixed,10/18/2022,4,The GPs have been good recently but over the last few years we had concerns about our son but didn't feel listened to and ended up going private to get a diagnosis.
Haverhill,A bit slow to get appointments,6/30/2022,4,"It's taken a fortnight from the original request to get this appointment with a GP. I had called, was given an appointment with a nurse practitioner who then said I did need to see a GP after all, I've then had to wait to see the GP.   When I've seen the GP and nurse they have all been very good.  I do struggle with my hearing aids when having conversations on the phone with GPs."
Haverhill,A good experience,2/24/2022,4,I've recently registered at the practice and all contact I've had with the surgery has been good. I phoned this morning and was able to get a face to face appointment quickly so the system works really well.
Haverhill,A good surgery,2/24/2022,4,The biggest problem is getting through on the phone which is frustrating but the doctors are good and econsult works well and gets you the right help when you need it.
Haverhill,Advice has been good,2/24/2022,5,Econsult generally works quite well but there are times where I'm unsure where to put certain information but it's worked well and got everything sorted out.
Haverhill,Appalling  got to wait two weeks for doctor,1/18/2022,2,I phoned yesterday and got through I’ve been trying for 2 weeks I now have to wait another two weeks for my phone call back to see if doctor thinks I need to see him. People are going to suffer as a phone call appointment is not enough where has the caring about a patient gone
Haverhill,Appointments fine to get,10/18/2022,4,"I don't come to the surgery much but got a text to say I needed to come in for a medication review, so I've needed to do a week of BP readings and now have a blood test to do as part of it. The appointment was easy to get and I've had no issues."
Haverhill,Appointments no problem,2/24/2022,5,"I've not had a problem getting appointments when I've needed them. It is more tricky getting through on the phones but the triage system and doctors have been brilliant. I have a special needs son and staff are always very good with him, it all works well."
Haverhill,Appointments when needed,2/21/2023,4,"I've never had a problem getting an appointment when it has been needed and I'm really happy with the process that's in place to contact the surgery. Econsult has worked very well and has meant my child has been seen the same day. The only area that could improve is after seeing a GP I was told I was being referred to the hospital but it was only when I called the unit at the hospital which was the Suspected Cancer Unit, that I found out I was being referred for a suspected cancer. At no point in the discussion with the doctor was it mentioned and it was quite a shock and was hard to hear that on a phone message.  Other than this one issue I feel that the surgery is really good and they have dealt with things quickly."
Haverhill,Awful,11/23/2022,1,"Over a year in pain, now have three different opinions of what is wrong and no diagnosis. Keep sending me for things like X-ray, physio, ultrasound when what is needed is a CT scan to see what’s wrong."
Haverhill,Blood Pressure monitoring-good & professional,9/10/2018,4,This was annual health check & annual hypertension review. Staff at both appointments were professional & explained clearly. Getting appointment was fine but made easier by attending the surgery ..not always easy to make appointments over the phone. Other attempts  to see a doctor is made more difficult because of the current system of availability of appointment times.
Haverhill,Call backs the same day,6/30/2022,4,When you need an appointment I've had a call back the same day from a GP and have then been given an appointment. I do prefer to phone over using econsult as its a bit cumbersome and often asks you to call 111 when its not necessary.
Haverhill,Call backs work well,10/18/2022,5,"The call backs I've had have worked well and the doctor addressed the concerns I had and gave me an appointment for the next morning. I'm happy with everything here, it works well. I've been concerned about my child but I've been pleased with how it's all been handled."
Haverhill,Can't fault,2/24/2022,4,All staff are extremely pleasant  and I can't fault the service offered. It takes a little more time than it used to but you do get seen or get an appointment with a clinician.
Haverhill,Delay in blood test results,7/31/2015,1,When I was at Stour View blood test results were made known to me in 24-48 hours. Now it's Family Practice and I have been waiting for nearly 3 weeks.
Haverhill,Difficult not seeing a doctor,6/9/2022,3,I think it would be very nice if GPs could go back to seeing people. I have been having trouble with my blood pressure and I have been told (on phone) to take it myself 3 times a day to keep a check on it. I went to have a cataract operation and was told that unless my blood pressure comes down they wouldn't do it. I feel it would be nice to see a doctor to discuss this.
Haverhill,Difficult to get appointments,7/25/2016,3,Very difficult to get appointments with continuity of care especially difficult.
Haverhill,Difficult to speak to a GP,9/16/2022,3,I find it difficult to speak to a GP. They do all they can to signpost you away to other services.  There is also confusion about who provides services like physio.
Haverhill,Doctors very helpful,6/9/2022,4,I have mostly found the surgery and also the doctors very helpful and when on one or two times we have had to have a doctor in the night they have been so good as to visit and on occasion have had to arrange for an ambulance in to hospital.
Haverhill,Doing a really good job,2/24/2022,5,"Staff are very pleasant, courteous and helpful. The triage system including econsult has worked well as it means you don't always have to come down to the surgery for every little thing, so its much more convenient. They are doing a great job considering the situation."
Haverhill,Doing very well,2/24/2022,4,"Considering everything, they are doing very well. It's easy to get the kids seen but may be not so easy for me. Waiting for a call back can be an issue as you're not sure when they will be calling but econsults for the children have worked really well and the staff are polite."
Haverhill,dp - poor,7/15/2016,2,practice nurses not professional. Good GPS
Haverhill,Econsult asks unnecessary questions,6/29/2022,5,"Very busy on the phones and if you call a bit later rather than first thing you can be told there are no appointments available and to call back the next day.  For this appointment I used econsult which does ask some unnecessary questions, which I understand, but after sending pictures I had a call back and an appointment was arranged for this morning (a day later). This has worked well and the practice as a whole is great it's just the phones that are an issue."
Haverhill,Econsult feels a little delayed,3/3/2023,4,"I mainly use eConsult to get appointments, it does feel a little delayed as you don't know when they will actually come back to you in the 48hr window.  Especially with children it is a little concerning that you may have to wait that long to get help."
Haverhill,Econsult took 1 week for a response,10/18/2022,4,I find the triage process a bit hit and miss at times.  I was passed on to a GP appointment at the weekend and they diagnosed the issue because there were no appointments available at the practice. I'm just glad that I've got a diagnosis and know what needs to happen. The nurse I saw after that confirmed what had been diagnosed which was good because I hadn't actually been seen by the doctor so wasn't confident that I had the right diagnosis.  I've spoken to the pharmacist about medication changes and I feel that worked really well.
Haverhill,Econsult works,6/30/2022,4,"Econsult is a bit impersonal but I haven't struggled to get appointments. They've been fine to get when I've needed them, you are more likely to see a nurse rather than a doctor face to face but that works well for most issues."
Haverhill,Econsult works well,2/24/2022,4,The phones are busy in the morning as expected but econsult works very well but you can't seem to use it for young children. The staff are all great and everyone is doing their best and they let you know if there are any issues or problems.
Haverhill,Efficient,2/24/2022,4,Phone consultations have worked well and everything has worked well for me. The biggest problem is getting through on the  phone but the actual treatment has been efficient and good.
Haverhill,Excellent service,4/12/2018,5,They are always rushed off their feet when I visit the surgery but they always try very hard to accommodate me. It is an excellent service. I like the system of text alerts. Also they are always there for my kids when I need them.
Haverhill,Experience today was good,1/19/2022,4,Bit of a pain having to do e consult as the phone is constantly engaged
Haverhill,fair,6/21/2016,3,Appointment time has got better.  Treatment depends on GP
Haverhill,fair,6/21/2016,3,"Bad service when daughter, 6, very poorly.  treated @ A & E"
Haverhill,fair,6/21/2016,3,need more practices.  3 weeks to get an appointment
Haverhill,Fantastic,10/18/2022,5,I've been treated fantastically by the practice throughout the pandemic and now. I haven't had to worry about getting appointments as they've been available whenever I've needed them. I'm not worried who I see here as the staff are all pleasant and reassuring.
Haverhill,Fantastic!,3/12/2018,5,"They are fantastic! They keep you up to date by text. Invite you in for routine appointments etc. Plus, the nurse practitioners are good."
Haverhill,Find the system difficult with my job,10/18/2022,3,Because I work from very early in the morning I do find it difficult to get appointments for ongoing non urgent issues. It would be better if e-consult was open before the surgery opens so that people can submit them before going to work. I also can't take phone calls while I'm working so do feel there needs to be a flexible system in place to allow those who work access to appointments.
Haverhill,Fine at the moment,3/3/2023,4,"I've been able to get all of my INR appointments with no delays but I do have to call to arrange them which can take time, anything up to 20 minutes. I've been seeing the paramedic regularly at the moment and they are very good.  There are often no immediate appointments available but I have had telephone triage calls followed by an actual appointment if it has been needed."
Haverhill,Friendly staff,10/18/2022,4,When I called to get an appointment I was 16th in the queue and it took about half an hour to get through. I generally only attend for diabetic checks etc. The staff I see are friendly and really good. I feel that it would be good to have a separate option on the phone for people trying to arrange routine regular appointments so that they do not hold up people who are needing to be seen on the day.  It would also be good to be able to book more than 2 weeks ahead.
Haverhill,Frustrating phones,3/3/2023,4,"The phones are very busy which is frustrating along with the long message on the phone and then being in the queue for 20-30 minutes waiting to speak to someone,  however I was offered an appointment this morning. I have had a brilliantly quick referral. The doctor acted quickly and I was called by addenbrookes the same day. Staff have been brilliant with how they've reacted and the treatment and care they've provided.  In some ways it is easier to be referred to Addenbrookes for things as I can take a free bus there but have to consider the cost of getting to West Suffolk Hopsital."
Haverhill,Generally ok,10/21/2022,4,Phone lines are busy most of the day but I'm happy with call backs and depending on the situation it means you don't always have to go into the surgery to be seen. I like that reception ask if you have a preference for a doctor and all other staff are nice and helpful.
Haverhill,Generally satisfied,6/18/2016,3,I am generally satisified apart from booking to see a doctor
Haverhill,Generally satisfied,2/5/2016,3,I am generally satisfied other than making a booking to see a doctor
Haverhill,Get to speak to someone,2/24/2022,5,It does take time to get through but you do always get to speak to someone. For non urgent issues it can take 2-3 weeks to speak to a doctor and then if an appointment is needed it's after that. I found the staff really supportive when I had covid and was discharged from hospital.
Haverhill,Getting a face to face is difficult,2/24/2022,4,"When I asked for a call back for a non urgent issue it took one and a half weeks to get and after that I had a face to face appointment 8 days later and I find it worrying. I don't find the phones too bad, it takes some time but you do get through if you stay on the line."
Haverhill,Getting through to the surgery difficult,2/27/2023,3,Getting through to the surgery is difficult and on the day appointments are more difficult but I do seem to get appointments when they are needed. I feel a bit unclear about the process as it can feel at times you are just being passed off to a different member of staff rather than just being dealt with.
Haverhill,Getting to see a GP is more difficult,10/18/2022,4,"I do feel that getting to actually see a GP is now more difficult, but I have been able to get face to face appointments a number of times so they are available, i's just that you have to speak to them first."
Haverhill,Good but very busy,3/3/2023,4,"The phones are very busy when you call but you are offered telephone consultations, although how helpful that is with a rash on a child I'm not sure. To get a response on eConsult does take 2 days to get a response. I was given a telephone appointment for a weeks time but wasn't sure what I should do if I got worse in the meantime as no explanation was given and would something be avaialble if i did call back?  Overall the care and treatment provided is good once you see someone."
Haverhill,Good care,3/11/2018,4,I think the care here is good. I am diabetic and my care is very good. I experience some problems with getting appointments but if it is an emergency it is very good.
Haverhill,Good Staff,3/3/2023,5,I've only had to wait about a week for this check up appointment and I was invited in by letter. I feel the surgery is coping well and the staff are good.  I have my medication delivered and they are always available on time.
Haverhill,Great job under the circumstances,2/21/2023,5,"It is sometimes diffiult to see a GP but I do get very well supported by the nurses with my diabetes. When calling the surgery I've had to wait half an hour but when I have got through I've received the help I was looking for.  The staff are excellent and couldn't be better and recpetion are lovely, so calming and reassuring on the phone."
Haverhill,Had no issues,2/24/2022,5,I book appointments by phone which works well especially considering the last two years. It's all worked well and the doctors are great.
Haverhill,Happy with how its worked,2/24/2022,5,"I came to the surgery this morning, spoke to reception and they booked an appointment for a bit over an hour later, you can't fault that. Times have been difficult but that can't be helped and everything has worked well for me when I've needed an appointment."
Haverhill,It is better,6/30/2022,5,It has got better more lately as previously I had struggled to get appointments but I've had two appointments with my doctor recently and it just feels easier to access the care you need.
Haverhill,Its eased recently,6/30/2022,5,"It has eased a bit recently. I've come to pick up a prescription and for my babys vaccinations which I've been able to arrange when they were needed. The doctor I saw last referred me quickly to the hospital for investigations, very pleased with that and I was seen there in 2 weeks. The staff and surgery are all very good."
Haverhill,I've given up trying to get an appointment,6/28/2018,1,"Administration of the appointment system is poor. I've currently given up trying to get an appointment. However, once you get an appointment, staff are very, very helpful and efficient."
Haverhill,Long wait on the phone,6/7/2022,4,I've had long waits of 50 minutes to get through on the phone. I asked for a call from a GP but have been given a nurses appointment. The nurse was brilliant and I was very happy with the care and treatment provided.
Haverhill,Marvellous,10/18/2022,5,"Absolutely marvellous. If I ring or come into the surgery to arrange an appointment, then they'll arrange for a doctor to give me a call and then an appointment with them if it is needed so I believe it is working very well. I see the ACP a lot and they are great - I've even asked for my wife to be seen by them as they are so thorough and attentive. I honestly don't feel anything needs to change at the surgery."
Haverhill,Medication not reviewed,9/16/2022,2,There have been delays getting test results on to the system and because my medication has not been monitored I now have other health issues. Call backs that have been requested have also not happened.  Its taken 5 months to get blood test results.
Haverhill,mental health services poor,1/20/2022,2,"was refused care for mental health services that have merged with haverhill family practise, i was told my issues are ‘too complex’ and services cannot help me"
Haverhill,New phone system much better,6/30/2022,4,"My young baby has twice been dealt with by phone and although I would've felt it more appropriate for her to be seen in person. My other child has now been seen after being unwell for a few days and they were given a face to face straight away with a paramedic, so we've had two different experiences this week. Its a good surgery and you can get help when it's needed just maybe not what you'd prefer.  The paramedic we saw today was very good and explained everything well and was great with both children putting them at ease. Very grateful they cast an eye over my first child to put my mind at ease too."
Haverhill,Nice you can come in now,6/29/2022,4,"It's sometimes difficult in the morning on the phone waiting to get through but it's nice that you can now come in to the surgery rather than queuing outside, it's much better."
Haverhill,No appointments,2/5/2016,3,I visited practice and the receptionist told me they had no appointments this week or next. So we went home and rang in and they told me to go to the other surgery.
Haverhill,No one able to do a urine dip,9/27/2022,1,"I have a long term issue, and get regular UTIs, but a couple of months ago I called the surgery and asked for a urine dip to be done as I knew I was getting/had a UTI. I was told there was no one available to do it. I ended up calling 111 over the weekend because the surgery were unable to help."
Haverhill,No problems,9/13/2018,5,Haven't  had any issues getting appointments and the call backs by doctors have been quick.  I prebooked todays blood test appointment and only waited 5 days for it. Econsult works well for me and I'm contacted with in the timeframe easily. The staff deal with everything well and are always good when you're with them being friendly and approachable.
Haverhill,No problems,3/12/2018,4,When I needed to see a doctor I get an appointment on the day-no problems for me.
Haverhill,Not an econsult fan,6/30/2022,4,The surgery called me to come in for a BP check. The appointment was within a week which was great and I'm happy with how the surgery works. I prefer face to face appointments and I'm not a fan of econsult as an option but I'm able to talk to reception still and they are always helpful.
Haverhill,Not seen a doctor in 2 years,6/9/2022,2,I have not been able to see a doctor for two years. You do not get phone calls only non reply emails when contacting the surgery online.
Haverhill,Not too bad at all,6/30/2022,5,I've not had to wait long for the appointment and I'm seeing the nurse who is appropriate for the issue.  It all works quite well now the only thing I'd improve is the amount of parking.
Haverhill,Nurse excellent,3/11/2018,4,I don't go often but I did have a flu jab here this year. It was well organised and the nurse who gave me the injection was excellent.
Haverhill,Nurses and paramedics are all good.,3/11/2018,3,"I have to wait too long for an appointment and when I am in with the doctors I usually feel rushed. The nurses, nurse practitioners and paramedics are all good."
Haverhill,Overall good as Stourview,7/31/2015,4,Overall good as Stourview. No experience of new joint practice.
Haverhill,Paramedic is good,6/3/2023,4,"I'm quite pleased as I've managed to see a GP today. I do find it difficult to explain everything on the phone when talking to the doctor and then its more difficult to get seen. I've lost confidnece as I don't feel that they know my medical history  and the lack of continuity  seems to prolong issues as each person you see needs it all explained to them. The paramedic is very good and I don't mind seeing them at all as they have time for you and are interested.  It would be good if the phone message could be shorter, it's very long,"
Haverhill,Phones are busy,12/10/2022,3,"I have spent a long time on the phone trying to get through to the surgery, I've then mostly been seen by locums. When I couldn't get through to the surgery I decided to go straight to A&E and saw the GP there. They diagnosed a ligament issue and suggested I go back to my surgery and see the practice physio but I was told that I couldn't as I'd been through A&E and instead I would have to self refer through to AHP for treatment."
Haverhill,Phones are busy,9/14/2022,4,Getting through on the phone can be quite a long wait at times as everyone is calling at the same time . I haven't used online access so far for appointments but do go online for medication. Apart from the wait on the phone it all works well for me.
Haverhill,Phones are busy,2/24/2022,4,Sometimes it is difficult to get a face to face appointment and the phones are busy but I'm quite happy to see any of the clinicians as they are all helpful and will point you in the right direction.
Haverhill,Phones are busy,2/24/2022,5,I have had issues getting through to the surgery as the phones are very busy. I would prefer a face to face appointment but I haven't needed one really. I've always had a good experience with phone consultations and the staff are great. Considering the circumstances they are doing very well.
Haverhill,Phones are frustrating,2/24/2022,4,It is frustrating trying to contact the surgery as it can be a long wait on the phones. I prefer face to face appointments but these have been more difficult to get in the past but I called a few days ago and was given one for today with a GP. Staff have been good and explain issues well.
Haverhill,Phones are very busy,2/27/2023,3,The phones are very busy and it takes time to get through and then they ask a range of questions. I have been able to get appointments booked ahead of time but it hasn't been so easy for on the day issues. My recent experience was that I contacted the surgery and was given a phone consultation for a weeks time and then after that I was then offered a face to face appointment in another weeks time.  Two weeks is a long time to wait when you're worried about something but I am understanding of the pressure they are all under.
Haverhill,poor,9/30/2019,2,Been here a long time.  Make an appointment in 6 weeks!
Haverhill,poor,9/30/2019,1,Awful.  Can't get an appointment.  Rude GPs
Haverhill,poor,9/30/2019,1,Getting an appointment is difficult bit - 4 weeks.  By then you have forgotten what was wrong!
Haverhill,poor,9/30/2019,1,"This surgery merged with Stourview.  Since then appointment choice is poor, staff not well organised.  Town needs a small hospital"
Haverhill,poor,9/30/2019,1,"Takes too long to get appointment, waiting to get phone answered then told all appointments gone!  Too many people for small surgery.  Need drop in centre back."
Haverhill,Poor - very hard to get appointment,1/11/2016,1,"Woke up with a severe eye problem.  I went to the practice and spoke with reception - no appointment today, go to pharmacist.
Pharmacist wasn't sure but sold me some ointment.  If this doesn't work I was told to make an appointment @ GP !  But I worrycan't try till Monday"
Haverhill,"Poor service, staff unhelpful",10/11/2016,1,"3 year old child attended appointment for flu vaccination.  Asked nurse to look into his ears ( he was complaiining of pain}.  Told to make another appointment.  Fair enough if a longer examination had been requested, 20 seconds to look in ears.   Mother went out to reception to make another appointment.  Told to phone at 1.30 pm.  She could not get through on the telephone so had to drag a sick child and baby out again to make appointment and again to attend"
Haverhill,Pretty good all round,3/12/2018,5,I can get an appointment on the phone on the day but you have to know the system (which days and when to ring). The ultrasound machine is now installed and will be operational very soon following a fund raising campaign. It is pretty good all round.
Haverhill,Reception have been great,6/30/2022,5,"I called last week and spoke to a doctor with in 3 hrs of contacting the surgery. After speaking to him I was advised to book an appointment with the nurse which I'm doing today, so I haven't had to wait long.  I  prefer to see a GP face to face more easily and to  be able to come in to the surgery so I'm pleased the restrictions are easing. The receptionist have been great."
Haverhill,Responses are good,10/18/2022,4,"Responses to either e-consult or phone calls is very good and really quick. The call backs work well, and I find the system in place works well for children too."
Haverhill,Seen nurses but not GPs,6/30/2022,4,"I've seen nurses for appointments but only had phone calls with GPs. I've called in the morning and been told to call back later in the afternoon when more appointments are released but if nothing is available then you have to wait until the next day to try again. The nurses are very good and offer very good care and advice, very friendly."
Haverhill,Shouldn't have to call up for annual check,6/9/2022,3,I would like to be contacted yearly for an appointment to have a yearly check up rather than having to ring up and request.
Haverhill,Staff and doctors very good,3/11/2018,3,In general I find the practice staff and doctors very good. The appointments system is not good but the shortage of doctors is the problem.
Haverhill,Staff are good,2/24/2022,5,I generally call the practice for appointments and this works well. The staff are good when you're talking to them and although the phones are busy in the morning you do get through.
Haverhill,Staff are magic,2/24/2022,5,I haven't had any issues getting appointments. I went through the triage process yesterday and had a phone appointment and the doctor booked me in for today to see them face to face. I've been able to book my blood tests easily enough and the staff are always thorough.
Haverhill,Still no face to face appointments,9/5/2022,1,"Still no face to face appointments,never answer the phone then always 30th in the que ,covid is being used as an excuse , disappointed."
Haverhill,Supportive staff,10/18/2022,4,I'm finding it's good most of the time and easy to arrange appointments when they are needed. Most of my care is managed by the hospital but the staff here are very supportive.
Haverhill,Takes too long to get an appointment,2/5/2016,1,It takes too long to make an appointment. Takes up to 12 minutes to get a phone call answered only to be told all appointments are gone. Too many people for a small surgery- we need the drop I'm centre back
Haverhill,Three week wait,6/30/2022,3,"To get blood test results has taken three weeks as a doctor has to do it. I don't find them as proactive as they used to be and you do end up having to chase at times. I wasn't able to get an appointment for a child with a foot issue but was advised to call 111, the problem was that they wouldnt discuss the situation as my son was at school and I couldn't confirm he was conscious, so that option didn't work either. I do like econsult as it allows you to attach photos and gets issues addressed but it can mean treatment is prolonged when different treatment options are tried."
Haverhill,Town needs more practices,2/5/2016,3,the town needs more practices-it takes 3 weeks to get an appointment
Haverhill,Triage is good,10/18/2022,5,"I like the triage process, it's a good idea as it stops people that don't need to be seen coming to the surgery. It's worked well today - I've spoken to a GP this morning and I'm now having a face-to-face appointment. The discussion I had with the doctor was good and I felt I was listened to. Very satisfied with how things are being done at the surgery."
Haverhill,Unable to see a GP,1/17/2022,3,I resent having to tell a receptionist my personal medical details. They have absolutely no medical qualifications!
Haverhill,Unhappy,6/9/2022,2,"In the last 2 years I've not been able to get face to face appointments, even now. This surgery was excellent up to covid. Dr (name removed) was magnificent when my husband was ill."
Haverhill,Very difficult to talk to a doctor,1/17/2022,3,"Having to call many many times to get through, just to be told no appointments available and to call back later, then unable to get through again"
Haverhill,Very good,2/24/2022,5,"Everything is good, I tend to call for appointments and get telephone consultations but I would like to be able to get an in person appointment more often however, the phone conversations have sorted the issues out. Its a good surgery and I'm grateful we have a good practice."
Haverhill,very rude and unhelpful,6/11/2015,1,After waiting 10 mins to even talk to someone
Haverhill,Very satisfied,6/9/2022,4,Very satisfied with how treated.  Hearing services in the area are not good. We need a local surgery.
Haverhill,Waited a month,9/27/2022,2,I had to wait 1 month for a response after contacting the surgery and being told someone would call me back about the eye issue I had. I then had to wait a further 6 months for the procedure to be done.
Haverhill,Wasn't bad,3/11/2018,3,Last time I had to go was for a blood test. It wasn't too bad once I had managed to make the appointment
Haverhill,Working well,9/23/2021,4,"I'm finding its all fine at the moment as you can get appointments within good timescales. We're here for immunisations and the appointment was easy to get, we went in on time and they were done well, so very happy with how it's all gone.Generally everything is working well and it does seem to have settled down a bit."
Haverhill,Worry so much is by phone,6/30/2022,4,Generally happy with the surgery. I came in as needed my ear looking with an ongoing issue at but reception wouldn't give me one as the surgery don't do ears any more (syringing). I wasn't asking for it to be syringed but just to check there wasn't anything else wrong as I've done everything the chemist has suggested. I was pleased that the member of staff sought advice and I was then given an appointment with a nurse.  I do worry that so much is done by phone now and issues will not be picked up that way.
High Street,45 mins behind,2/21/2022,3,"Our appointment is 45 minutes behind today. It does not help when you work as had to take time off for this.   When we went online to use the 'ask reception' section during surgery hours it said that the service was closed as have 'no more appointments'.  As we did not want an appointment and it makes it seem like you can 'ask' something, this was a bit ridiculous. If no appointments, then that is fine, but why shut off other online services because we ended up having to ring instead, which seems to defeat the object of having online systems to help relieve the telephone lines."
High Street,Absolutely appalling surgery.,10/28/2022,1,"On certain occasions this year I’ve been wise enough to not call and to use the online service through the website for that not to work and then when calling up being told no appointments left for the week. The receptionists are extremely rude and have no customer service skills and no empathy towards their patients. I was then told that my doctor would ring me up the following week to discuss the situation, it was the person I wanted to speak to but having to wait a week for something important is not on."
High Street,Absolutely terrible service,10/19/2021,1,"This practice would prefer that you directed all medical issues to A&E rather than them. It is virtually impossible to get a face to face appointment with a doctor.  There is no location on their website that will allow you to make an appointment and if you try to telephone the phone will just ring constantly without being answered. The 4 hour response time to an online enquiry is an absolute joke - 4 days at least (when they even bother to respond) would be more realistic.  Very often when you try to book an appointment online you will get a message saying ""THIS SURGERY IS NOW CLOSED"" - at 10.00 in the morning!!!  This must be the worst surgery that I have ever used and sadly I checked all the reviews before I registered and High Street Surgery didn't appear too bad which makes me wonder what on earth the other surgeries in the area are like. It appears that they are inundated with administration staff but have a distinct lack of doctors."
High Street,Access difficult when work,2/21/2022,4,"It is a system that does not work for those of us who work. When you are well enough to work but need to access the service, a phone call at no given time, just does not work. It is difficult to access the service when you work. I do feel they need to look at it and at least be able to give you an hour slot in the day to listen for your call."
High Street,Access into the door,1/23/2020,4,"In a wheelchair it can be difficult to get into the building especially when the queue is out the door.  All you need is another person in a wheelchair, or someone with a pram coming the other way and you have to back out and start again, which during the winter is a bit horrible."
High Street,All good despite....,1/23/2020,5,"Apart from waiting times on the telephone, I find the surgery good.  My 'registered' GP does not know me from Adam, but at the moment that is not an issue, as any GP can sort my issues out.  Find the P.O.D difficult (fed back separately on this)"
High Street,always good apart from last appointment,10/1/2020,4,i care for my wife 24/7 and am prone to chest infections which does not help nor did the last doctor i saw who replaced dr (name removed). . Knowing this gave me a leaflet instead of meds that was before Christmas its now the 10th of January and im still ill.
High Street,Always helpful,1/30/2018,5,"I have always found the staff helpful, whoever I see and the nurses too."
High Street,Appalling,1/8/2021,1,"Trying to get test results for second CT as lump found in the first one. Given different information every time I called. One receptionist even told me that my results where with the doctor and they wouldn’t be put online as the Dr had to speak to me about my results. Was told the Dr would call in next couple of days, still waiting. Went into the surgery Friday evening and was told my results hadn’t come in. I suffer with anxiety & depression and this has made it worse. Practice Manager will be getting a visit Monday morning."
High Street,Appointment system,6/6/2016,3,I hate the appointment system here. Having to call close to 8am and put in a waiting line on the phone. It takes ages then you do not always get an appointment. Very frustrating.
High Street,Appointment today,2/21/2022,4,"I am not a frequenter of the surgery. Seeing the GP today who I have not seen before.  I put an online request in and have this appointment today, which is 8 days later. I did not get any call between that and feel for the issue I have 8 days is acceptable to me."
High Street,Appointment waiting time is unacceptable,12/4/2018,4,Long time to wait for appointment.
High Street,Appointments,11/5/2023,1,"Every time I 'phone to try and get an appointment I'm told 'phone back tomorrow!! It's ridiculous! How am I supposed to get an appointment? If I go in I'm still told the same, 'phone tomorrow'."
High Street,Appreciate the home visits,3/17/2016,5,"As I have a dual sensory loss, I appreciate that this surgery will do home visits."
High Street,Average,6/10/2016,3,Overall the quality of care is good but it is just hard sometimes to get that care. Sometimes it is hard to get an appointment and sometimes it is fine.
High Street,Awful service awful staff - left after 23year,1/17/2022,1,Can't see doctor 3 weeks wait for phone appointment. Our doctor left and no one told us yet he called us on phone appointment
High Street,Better than other places,1/23/2020,4,"With the amount of patients here, I thought it would be difficult as I came from a very busy surgery when I moved and it was a nightmare there to get an appointment with anyone, let alone GP.  So I have been impressed with the service as I have accessed it pretty much anytime I have needed to, which has been about 5 times this last year."
High Street,Better than previous surgery,1/30/2018,5,I moved here when Marine Parade closed suddenly and we cannot fault them. We easily got an appointment today.
High Street,Book online for kids too,1/23/2020,4,"It would be handy to book online for my child.  I know they do not allow it as I have asked, and they say it is due to data protection, but I would think that there is a way to sort this, as I do feel it would help the surgery as I am sure many parents are on the phone trying to get appointment for their children."
High Street,Can never seem to get appointment,1/11/2019,2,Ring up at 8 for a appointment that day line was busy after 40 minutes and 100 calls later still couldn't get through so had to go in to try get a appointment and obviously was told no appointments available even though I needed it ASAP for my 1 year old now have to wait for call back may change doctors surgery as this happens all the time
High Street,Cannot get an appointment,5/24/2023,1,"Everyday I go onto the website for 8am to book an appointment, by the time I have navigated my way through (couple of minutes of that) when I go to make an appointment it is fully booked. On the one occasion that this has not happened I submitted the form and then got response advising that there were no Appointments left for this day. I have been trying since March to get an appointment about an ongoing health concern. Shocking. Staff attitudes on the phone are also rude and unhelpful."
High Street,Cared for over the years,1/23/2020,5,"Have been under this surgery for a number of years and I have never had any reason to complain. If you are ill enough to need to see someone you always get in, in my experience.  My ongoing condition gets seen by the same person, but this is booked in advance."
High Street,Delayed access,2/21/2022,3,"Things just seem to be more delayed now. Access difficult to a GP who you end up seeing weeks later once seen/spoken to others first. Just feels they are delaying your access, and I am sure it is for good reason, but when you have a concern, that just makes it worse"
High Street,Didn't see who I thought I was,1/23/2020,4,"When I was booked in, I thought I was seeing a GP, but the screen suggests not.  It makes me wonder what happens after you get off the phone, who decides to tell me I am seeing a Doctor and then changes it to a Nurse. The Professionals are very lovely, but back office staff, I feel now less confident in."
High Street,Different,11/18/2021,5,"Asthma review letter came but unable to book as always full,,last year you could do a asthma review online and was a lot more simple than not getting a appointment and at least my records can be updated as it happens asthma controlled well."
High Street,Difficult to get appointments,2/16/2023,2,"As so many times before, I have tried to complete an appointment form 4 mornings in a row. Three minutes to 8 ‘Surgery closed’, 2 minutes to 8 ‘we are fully booked’. I don’t believe the form was ever available today. This surgery just cannot cope with demand."
High Street,Ear wax removal used to be free,12/21/2022,4,Earwax removal used to be free at the surgery but now I am forced to go and get it done privately and it is so costly. Could an assistant be trained up and assigned to a group of surgeries around the county?
High Street,Efficiency and professional,2/2/2022,5,"Very efficient . Previously I was not impressed with my mother’s repeat medication as item always missing and the pharmacy I collect from was telling me surgery’s fault so I left an online message and they got back to me within half an hour and spoke to a helpful polite person who went through everything with me and relized  it was pharmacy not requesting the correct medication and the person said she would inform pharmacy of this .
Also I messaged on behalf of my mother a request for a face to face app at home due to my mother’s mobility and again that day a nurse from surgery came out for visit and sorted the problem out and again very polite and professional . So overall would highly recommend this surgery ."
High Street,Even thou very busy they fitted me in,11/8/2015,5,Had a really bad asthma attack - spoke to nurses who told me to come down and they would fit me in etc
High Street,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Everyone very pleasant.  Saw the locum GP - very kind and thorough.  Approachable  Would not hesitate to see them again
High Street,Fair but long wait for appointment.,8/14/2017,3,I am finding that I have to wait longer for an appointment with my GP.  Three weeks last time (it used to be sooner) unless it's an emergency!
High Street,Fair but poor communication.,7/8/2017,3,One of our service users has been prescribed antibiotics by out of hours GP as he has had a leg infection. Two days later we received different antibiotics for the same service user. We have rung the GP to inform him that our service user is already on antibiotics which he started two days ago with the instruction that he needs to finish the course. The High Street Surgery GP instructed us to stop the previous course and start the new one immediately.  No communication.
High Street,fast,4/20/2020,5,arived for appointment   ]receved treatment very satisfied with rreatment many thanks
High Street,Fast referral,7/10/2018,5,Excellent surgery. I had referrals very quickly when I had a lump in my throat and other surgery required.
High Street,Feel the waits are too long,2/21/2022,3,"When I used FOOTFALL on a Monday, I did not get a call back until the Friday, which is quite some time to wait. A blood test was requested in December and is only now happening (February), which seems ages to me. I was contacted to call and organise a medication review with pharmacist, I rang in and left a message, and finally 2 weeks on had it reviewed. As this was due to reaction to meds I was on, I felt that was too long and I was not told in the meantime whether to continue or stop with the meds."
High Street,Flexible for appointments,1/2/2018,4,"The surgery staff are lovely and I usually can get appointment when I need one. If I cannot, my GP gives me a call and prescribes me something over the phone if applicable."
High Street,Friendly!,5/17/2018,4,We work closely with High Street Surgery. I find the doctor very friendly and always able to help.
High Street,Generally pleased with care,6/7/2018,4,Long time to wait for appointment.
High Street,Good,7/3/2019,4,Have never had a problem getting an appointment.  Feel comfortable with my doctor and always see the same doctor.  Repeat prescriptions system is good.
High Street,"Good Surgery, appointments are tricky",8/1/2018,4,Surgery is good overall. Find it difficult to get appointment.
High Street,Good. Nurse was excellent.,7/8/2017,4,"Service user attended the surgery to have her ears syringed.  She has dementia and can get agitated when out of her familiar environment.  The nurse was very patient, gentle and understanding of this.  The appointment was delayed but this is to be expected at times.  The service user commented that the nurse was ""nice"""
High Street,GP too slow with medication sign off,12/11/2020,2,"My wife has emotionall unstable personality disorder (EUPD) and also Crohn's disease and I am concerned that when an emotional crisis occurs her GP is too slow in signing off her vital medication that she needs to support her in that moment,  which could potentially short circuit any possible call out to the emergency services at that time. We have had a good experience with the mental health support staff based at Victoria House, but when my wife needs specific medication in a crisis she does not need to wait 2-3 days before they are signed off by the GP she needs them in that moment. This has happened more than once before, please can you highlight this concern with your GP's so that we do not get a repeat of this in the fuiture."
High Street,Grateful for the support,1/2/2018,5,All great doctors. They all try to help as i'm off work with depression and injury.
High Street,Great surgery,1/2/2018,5,No complaints. A lovely surgery.
High Street,Happy with the surgery,1/2/2018,4,Overall really happy with surgery. Been coming for number of years and always been happy.
High Street,Heart failure diagnosis,5/2/2020,4,"I was diagnosed with heart failure - there was no real information given to me at the time apart from ""take these tablets"". I only knew about heart failure through my mum so I was aware of the British Heart Foundation and requested some info from them. My initial diagnosis was over the phone, and I then had an appointment the following week to take my blood pressure and be prescribed my meds. It would have been useful to at least have been given a leaflet or something in that appointment.
Otherwise I get good care here, good support from the Doctor. A lot of older people may just give up trying to get an appointment though as it's so difficult"
High Street,Helpful PPG member,1/23/2020,5,"Surgery today had a very helpful PPG member. I couldn't check myself into the screen as it was saying that I could not be checked in and need to see receptionist.  The queue was very long and my legs are not very good, so I sat down and she got to the bottom of it.  Unfortunately, it was totally my fault as I had the wrong day.  Thank you to that lady for helping me."
High Street,High St Surgery,1/11/2019,4,They do their best in the circumstances. More Doctors required.
High Street,High St Surgery,1/11/2019,2,Doctors are excellent. Waiting times are abominable. I cannot get through until 3pm on the telephone. Too many people. Do not mind seeing nurse but need more GPs too.
High Street,Horrendous time and time again,8/13/2022,1,"My daughter has Epilepsy but getting the medication that’s prescribed to her is an ordeal EVERY month. The surgery don’t read letters from the consultant  so they don’t inform GPs of changes to medication meaning that when it’s time to order a prescription, the things you need most aren’t on the prescription because the Dr hasn’t put it on repeat."
High Street,How to get an appointment with a GP or nurse,11/4/2023,1,"Apparently you can only get on the day appointments and are told to 'phone at 8.00am. So you 'phone at 8.00am and you are number 10 in the queue!!! Bizarre! When you eventually get through to a Receptionist you are told there are no appointments available this morning, to 'phone back at 2pm in the afternoon. You 'phone back in the afternoon at 2pm and you are number 8 in the queue! Again when you eventually get through to a Receptionist there are no appointments available!!!  get told try tomorrow and so it goes on ! If you go into the surgery you still can't get an appointment, or if you try online."
High Street,Impossible to book an appointment,7/4/2022,2,I am told to book an appointment every three months to have a B12 injection and every time I ring my surgery or try to book online I can't.  To have any communication with the High Street Surgery in Lowestoft is next to impossible.
High Street,Initial contact difficult,2/21/2022,3,"I have tried to use FOOTFALL online system, but I do not find it very helpful as you do not get a response very quickly. When you call, I do find most of the time the team are pretty abrupt, so I do avoid that and use the online system. I just feel it needs to be better."
High Street,Just awful since everything has to be done online,10/16/2020,2,"The experience with this being on line is saying that once you put in your request some one will contact you within 4 working hours. 
When no-one phoned, I phoned the doctors and waited 20 mins for them to answer. I explained my situation and was told that the 4 hours is not something that they can deal with as that's not exactly true. I said I put in a request for a call back only to be told I wouldn't get one until the next day. They said if my symptoms get worse to call 111."
High Street,Just not enough staff,1/23/2020,5,"There is nothing anyone can do beyond what they are trying to do, and that is to recruit more GP's.  I work in the system and so fully understand the difficulty in getting permanent GP's as well as Nurse Practitioners. They have put systems in to try and make sure you see right person, and I personally feel that works well, though I know of others who do not like it, but when you do not have the staff there needs to be these things happen.  I find them all so lovely, under really difficult pressure."
High Street,Lack of communication,1/29/2018,1,"We normally have a GP attending the home today and from a Tuesday onwards the surgery will not visit and say we have to wait for Thursday GP round, to then be told they no longer do Thursday rounds and only come out on Friday. We had no prior communication informing us of this."
High Street,Lovely service - Friendly - Helpful,5/17/2018,5,"The nurse practitioner is always helpful when she comes in, nothing is too much for her. Staff find her helpful, professional and supportive. She is resident focused."
High Street,Mental health care,9/4/2021,1,"My mum filled in the online form Tuesday 6th at 17.45 the request was’ mental health need to talk’ she got a message back Wednesday to say her GP would call or email on Monday 12th, my mum has a history of suicide attempts and rarely reaches out, when she does it is because she is in a bad place!! She has a lot of faith in her gp but she is slowly losing this as similar has happened before where she has felt like she is just a nuisance!! Quite frankly I don’t think this is good enough, I have spent hours trying to call the surgery myself but have been unable to make telephone contact with them!!"
High Street,Mental health care,9/4/2021,1,"In April, my mum filled in the online form. The request was’ mental health need to talk’ she got a message back to say her GP would call or email, my mum has a history of suicide attempts and rarely reaches out, when she does it is because she is in a bad place!! She has a lot of faith in her GP but she is slowly losing this as similar has happened before where she has felt like she is just a nuisance!! Quite frankly I don’t think this is good enough, I spent hours trying to call the surgery myself but was unable to make telephone contact with them!!"
High Street,Never had any issues,12/11/2019,5,"I never had any issues with the service when it comes to the care they have shown me.  I just have a suggestions, as I was unable to locate where I needed to be to see the Nurse as there are two seating areas.  There are no signs for specific areas, however Nurses do come out and call you. I just felt as I was past my appointment time, that I was concerned that I may have missed it and was sitting in the wrong area.
I would be very open to using an 'online' system to potentially speak to a clinician, instead of ringing in."
High Street,No issues,2/21/2022,5,"I do not use the service very often, but when I need it, it works fine for me. I have only needed to see Nurses though and it could be more difficult if I felt I needed a GP appointment.  I use the online system and get sent an appointment."
High Street,No notice that I needed to provide a sample,2/22/2022,2,"Had a Blood test on 14th January, heard nothing until I rang in on 21st February to be told that a stool sample was required and requested on 25th January! No e-mail, phone call or letter has been received, no follow up was heard of. I was Totally unaware of any such request until I called. The receptionist told me as much as she could which included that there was something wrong with my bloods........but again until I asked I have not and still have not been fully informed. I await a call from my doctor on Friday 25th pm to explain. Not impressed at all with the recent service, which is a shame as we all rely on the NHS so much."
High Street,Not seeing who I thought,12/11/2019,3,"I am not happy, as I booked to see a GP, yet I arrive today and I am seeing a Nurse Practitioner. I was on the 'phone for 20 minutes, then get here and there is a massive queue.  (CDO asked if patient could use the new 'check-in' screen). - I do not know how to use it.  The CDO explained the likely steps of using it- questions linked with D.O.B. and initial of Surname"
High Street,Offers Home visits,3/17/2016,5,"This surgery works well for me being elderly. If I need a home visit, I can get one and that is not always the case with the surgeries in the area, so I feel lucky."
High Street,Ok,5/16/2022,3,"You do not now have a consult/ask the practice for help online messaging. Always says fully booked from first thing in morning . On calling the surgery which I detest doing as you also have a very long time wait 30 mins plus I asked the receptionist the above question who told me go to ask the receptionist but guest what same Fully booked , all I want to know is where and how do I leave a message for help from the practice instead of all the options come back fully booked , it gets worse as time goes by to now leave a simple medical message rather then wait ages to speak to someone"
High Street,Ongoing care,2/21/2022,4,"I have received ongoing care from the service, especially from the nursing team. We as a family have had a good service when we have needed it."
High Street,Online Form has issues,6/5/2021,3,"The practice encourage you to complete and submit the online form for your issue. I have done this on several occasions. And received no response, for example I have completed the form for my daughter prescription milk powder due to an allergy. After two days I had had no response and had to call the practice only to discover no one had dealt with it."
High Street,Paramedic service here,1/23/2020,5,I came in once to see the Paramedic initially and they were then able to refer me direct to the GP. I think that is an excellent idea to assist patients in putting their minds at rest and then access if needed to the GP. Very professional and prompt service. Thank you
High Street,"Phone consultation, booked, never happened",3/11/2021,2,"After feeling very unwell for three days I spoke to the receptionist, in November, who said that I would receive a call the next morning. As luck would have it, and purely by chance, I felt better this morning BUT NO call was received that I was promised....most unsatisfactory. Plus after 8 days ordering a repeat prescription via the NHS POD and it being signed off I went to the chemist to find that the doctor had Not signed it off and had to wait another 30 mins for it to be done! Why does one system say one thing and yet the doctor had not signed it off? Its all the NHS. Why doesn't one system talk to the other and waste peoples time and the doctors when I had to chase for it....a prescription for my 94 year old for crying out loud. I feel very let down on this occasion, which is such a shame"
High Street,Queue is really bad,1/23/2020,4,"As the surgery is quite small, if you need something from reception, the queue ends up out the door. When it is cold it is not pleasant.  The way the queue goes means that it blocks you from the screen to check-in, so that gets awkward too. Needs to be rethinked."
High Street,Receptionist would not book appointment,7/23/2019,1,"Went in to book a regular appointment. Receptionist refused and said I needed to ring tomorrow and make an on the day one. I told her I couldn't make phone calls so would have to walk up there and I was working tomorrow so can I just book a regular one, I don't need an on the day appointment. She flat out refused, said appointments were booked for 4 weeks so I needed to keep trying for an on the day one, the doors open at 8.20-8.30 and the phone lines open at 8am and seeing as she is refusing to book regular appointments, what are the chances of me getting one by trying 20-30mins are the phone lines have opened. I don't care if I have to wait 4 weeks for an appointment but she refused to book one. Isn't that literally her job, to book people in and she refused to do it."
High Street,Respectful doctor,1/26/2018,5,"The Dr attended Britton Court to see a resident who is known to be difficult as she has dementia, he was very respectful of this, did not rush, communicated everything to her and not to the staff member present at the time. He then came to visit another resident a few days later and just come to check on the lady whilst he was in the building."
High Street,"Ridiculous,",5/10/2021,1,"Phone early to get an emergency appointment, as have had a sore throat for over two weeks, to get told to book online, which I do but can’t get a call back for five days, so ridiculous"
High Street,See a Locum,2/21/2022,3,"I was told that my GP ONLY now does telephone calls and no face to face.  I have come in and had to see a locum. I was offered a call back from my GP but as you cannot give a time, and I work I opted to come in and see the locum. It just does not work well like this.  Surely if an appointment can be given for you face to face, all you do is put you in for a call instead.  It is not accessible for people who work and that must be not just here"
High Street,Slack,7/1/2021,1,"4 days to receive a telephone call when you put a footfall in, ridiculous and complete lack of care."
High Street,Specific timeslot,2/21/2022,3,"It can be difficult when you work to answer the telephone, in fact, it can be impossible. I have missed it and then lose out on a 'appointment', then have to start all over again the next day.  Do feel there needs to be a different approach for those who work and for those who do not."
High Street,Taking longer to see GP..,1/23/2020,3,"It seems now you have to see nurses a few times about the same thing before you will get to see the GP, and for all that time you just worry.  I have had that a couple of times where I did end up needing the GP to get to the bottom of the issue and ended up with hospital referral, which obviously was delayed due to unnecessary appointments with Nurses."
High Street,Telephone waiting is frustrating,1/22/2020,4,"Getting through on the telephone is very difficult and frustrating. I had not realised there are more receptionists than visible at front desk, but it shows you how many people are ringing up and the level of need. Unfortunately, I am unable to use online services."
High Street,Telephone waiting is understandable,1/23/2020,5,"As everyone is told to phone first thing if you'd like an appointment, it means you wait for quite some time and I understand that.  I personally feel the system needs to change so there are various times to call. Get more people online booking for non emergency things.  I believe however, that you cannot book for a GP online now, so they need to change that too, as non-emergency things tend to be long term conditions and for that you do want to see your own GP."
High Street,They dont like speaking to people,1/3/2021,1,I have waited in pain for 10 days 3 times the receptionist said they will contact me and 3 times they have failed
High Street,Things getting more difficult,11/3/2020,3,"The surgery is changing as there are only 2 main GP’s now. I can’t think last time I saw mine. I’m elderly with long term conditions and find I’ve learned st confidence in how they can take care of my needs now. I fully understand the pressures and quite honestly do not know how it can or will change,I’m just sharing how it affects me."
High Street,Thoroughly recommend here,1/22/2020,5,This surgery is amazing. I can thoroughly recommend it as they have looked after me so well through the years with various minor and a couple of major issues.
High Street,Timing is awful,8/1/2018,4,Not always running to time. Frustrating time getting appointments.
High Street,Treatment was good,6/4/2018,5,"I had a heart attack in the Dec 2014, then triple bypass. I have nothing but good things to say about the treatment I have had since."
High Street,Tricky appointment booking,1/2/2018,5,Getting appointment on the day is difficult. Can do it online although 3 weeks wait.
High Street,Unable to access online routine appointment,2/16/2023,1,Try to get a routine appointment on line or to ask Reception a question and every time it comes up with sorry we are fully booked today try tomorrow! How can I?
High Street,Unable to ask Reception a question,2/12/2022,1,"When you go onto the High Street Surgery site there is a box which says Ask Reception a Question, but when you click on it , it comes up saying we are fully booked and have no appointments or sorry we are closed! How can you ask a question then? I don't want an appointment and I know the surgery isn't closed when it's the middle of the day!"
High Street,Unable to get basic data,9/26/2022,1,"I wanted to obtain some basic medical information from my record, but the 'Ask the Receptionist' form was unavailable due to 'appointments' being full and when calling instead, the surgery is closed from 1-2pm.  It is ridiculous that I can't send a form to ask for the information, which will take very little time to locate from my medical record."
High Street,UTTER SHAMBLES- extremely poor practice,3/16/2021,1,"I Have several underlying health issues, at the end of last week (friday) i received an invite for my covid jab from High Street Surgery via SMS, i logged in, but nowhere had anything available, plus, not feeling well, i decided to wait till sunday and book for monday /tuesday. I logged in on Sunday, to find that my invitation has been cancelled with no explanation as to why. so now, i have no alternative to totally shield till i get another invite- that is , if i actually get another one!!!! Poor show!!!!
Plus, was told by my cardiologist i have to have blood tests every 3 months and my surgery would contact me. so far, nothing, this has been over 18 months. Have tried on several occasions to get an appointment but to no avail. If only they had not turned off your reviews, mine would definitely be a ''does not recommend'"
High Street,Very accommodating,1/2/2018,4,Always very supportive around my multiple conditions. Can usually get appointments when I need one and always can for my child.
High Street,Very caring doctor,1/26/2018,5,"The Dr visited Britton Court to see a resident, he then had to break the news to the gentleman's wife that he was 'End of Life'. He done this with such compassion and sensitivity. When he then left, the gentleman's wife commented on how lovely he was in the way he delivered this news"
High Street,Very polite,6/10/2020,4,Very good and polite
High Street,Very satisfied,1/30/2018,5,I have been coming here for a number of years and I am very satisfied
High Street,Vigilant and supportive,12/23/2021,5,"Found the surgery very supportive and vigilant about my ongoing cancer care with the hospital. My previous surgery refused a blood test for prostrate cancer (another in Lowestoft), because I had no symptoms. I changed to here 3 years ago and requested the test. Immediately this happened and they have been assessing me every since. I go in about every 3 weeks.  They are lovely people. So, to clarify, the test did reveal that I needed treatment and if I had stayed at the other surgery, it would have been missed."
High Street,Wanted to arrange a non-urgent referral,6/6/2022,1,"I wanted to email my GP to ask them to refer me for a minor procedure, but as all of the 'appointments' for today are full, it prevents you from sending ANYTHING to the surgery.  Whilst I appreciate that there are only a set number of 'appointments' each day, this wasn't for an appointment and could have been 'received' and dealt with at a later day/time."
High Street,Website not fit for purpose,6/4/2023,1,"The practice encourages patients to use its website to book appointments, however it nearly always states no appointments available today. One may be happy to have an appointment in say a weeks time but the site does not allow this! Being so frustrated I walked a mile to the surgery only to be told they couldn't make an appointment at that time."
High Street,Will book appts in advance,1/2/2018,4,"They use language I can understand. Although I cannot see my own GP on the day, I understand. I did not know that I may be able to book advanced appointments."
High Street,Wish to book online for children,1/22/2020,4,"It would be very helpful if you were able to book online for your children.  I am not sure why.  (CDO checked with PM and explained it is to do with data protection).  I am sorry but that does not seem to make sense, as I call up and make appointments for them and only have to give the D.O.B, surely these are the same online questions/hoops you jump through so they know who are you.
I was 40th in the queue this morning, so with 2 little ones waiting on the telephone for that length of time is quite stressful, so please can we see how we can get this up and running."
High Street,working under pressure they never fail,9/20/2021,5,Always polite. Always helpful. On line prescription requests are dealt with promptly with an absolute minimum of fuss. Forms submitted to the surgery regarding health concerns were also dealt with promptly. The covid vaccination notifications were also dealt with efficiently. Big thank you to all the staff at this practice.
High Street,You can’t make an appointment,9/9/2021,1,"My husband called this morning and asked for an appointment as he has been in pain for a couple of weeks and was asked “do you have access to the internet” when It was confirmed we do he was told to fill in an online form. It was explained that he wanted a quick response and the receptionist proceeded to fill in the form whilst he was on the phone and then told him he would get a call within 48 hours. He was further told that if he didn’t answer the call when it did come then he would go to the bottom of the list and then have to wait for another day. I was under the impression that GPs could now make appointments for face to face without the need for electronic triage? Also, what is one supposed to do if the call comes when you are on the toilet or asleep because you have taken painkillers because you are in pain - sounds like it might be days before any real intervention might be made."

Holbrook,Admin staff lovely,4/14/2023,4,"The admin staff here are lovely and do all they can to get you an appointment. I was given an appointment with GP+ but when I got there they couldn't do what was needed.  The dispensary staff are brilliant and so helpful sorting out my medication and the reception staff were so helpful when I had it issues, they were very willing to help."
Holbrook,Brilliant care,4/14/2023,4,"Although it is frustrating trying to get through to the surgery as it takes so long the care is brilliant and I can't fault that aspect, the staff are all great.  I would prefer a different phone system so that there is a longer queue and you know where you are and can make a decision more easily about what to do."
Holbrook,Can always get an appointment,11/20/2015,4,If I ring up after 8am. I can always get an appointment
Holbrook,Can't fault staff,4/14/2023,5,The doctors and other staff I can't fault but it is frustrating trying to get through to the surgery and more often than not there aren't appointments available. They can't give out what isn't available so it's not their fault. I've been very happy with the doctor I've seen and the paramedic was amazing.  Other than access/ the phones the surgery is very good and I recognise that they are in a difficult position at the moment.
Holbrook,Care is good,4/14/2023,4,It's a bit of a challenge to get through to the surgery on the phone but we've had quick appointments when the children have been unwell which is good.  To get appointments for non urgent issues can be difficult as you can't book ahead to fit around other committments and because appointments are limited its not seen as urgent when you call on the day.  The care though is good when you do see a doctor.
Holbrook,Care is very good,4/14/2023,4,I have had to call three mornings in a row to get today's appointment as none have been available by the time I get through. I do feel it would be better if you were put in a queue on the phone rather than having to keep calling as it means you can't get on with other things.  I would also prefer different music when you are in the short queue as I really don't like it.  Once through to the surgery the staff are helpful and the care is very good once you are seen.
Holbrook,Caring staff,5/12/2018,5,"The surgery is very good, staff are caring and help to sort things out. I really can't fault the service provided. Generally to get a blood test done is easy enough which is good."
Holbrook,Difficult to see preferred GP,2/12/2022,3,Its been difficult when having conversations with reception as I often can't see or speak to my preferred GP at short notice. I was told by my GP that they would need to see me in two weeks but when I tried to book reception couldn't give me an appointment. I really like continuity with my GP but this seems more difficult to maintain.
Holbrook,Difficulty getting an appointment,4/14/2023,3,"My consultant requested that I had an appointment so the surgery contacted me to ask me to arrange one.  I've tried  with no success to contact the surgery by phone but have had to keep redialing as unable to join a queue. I would rather have a longer wait in a queue than having to redial so much.  There have been no appointments available when I've called and I've been told to call again. In the end I completed an econsult explaining the situation and was  then given an appointment.  Unfortunately econsult options don't always seem to fit why you are contacting the surgery and you have to put answers in even if its not the truth and then try to explain the situation.  The doctors when you see them are nice and good, it's just getting through to them and getting an appointment that is the issue."
Holbrook,Drs very good,4/14/2023,4,The doctors and care is very good but the availability of appointments is very limited. I was only 20th in the queue and there were no appointments left when I got through. I was advised to call back at lunch and there was still nothing available.  Today I came to the surgery to book an appointment which worked well. There is no continuity which is difficult for ongoing complex issues and due to the limited time available I do feel pressure to be quick.  Getting appointments is the main issue here.
Holbrook,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"A good surgery, works well.  Would be concerned as to how it will cope with the additional housing going up"
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Brilliant!
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Good staff relations like in magazines!  Doctors are patient
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Excellent service throughout
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Had a 2 week wait for an appointment- but has since improved
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,We value our doctor a lot
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Absolutely wonderful!
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,look after me very well - we have a good surgery
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,excellent amenity
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,good service
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,They look after my husband & myself ever so well.  Can't fault them
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,very willing to help - very kind
Holbrook,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Getting an appointment at the surgery is not a problem.  Staff have always been very good and helpful
Holbrook,excellent,3/16/2016,5,Always polite and helpful
Holbrook,Excellent and easy getting appointments,9/21/2017,5,Really great surgery.  Able to get appointments when needed;  we're very lucky.  Can also go to the Shotley surgery if need be.
Holbrook,Excellent Service,6/18/2016,5,Very impressed with the practice and it's team.
Holbrook,"Excellent, a very personal system",8/12/2016,5,"Really can't fault it at all.  They really don't rush you and it's a very personal approach.  The system used works very well; you're able to get on the day and advance appointments easily.  Unless my doctor is sick
I will always see the same one"
Holbrook,Excellent. Early starts and low turnover of staff which is good,9/21/2017,5,Opens nice and early.  Blood test next week is just after 8 am which is great.  Really stable GP's which is really good for the community
Holbrook,Fine,4/14/2023,4,More or less get appointments when they are needed and overall I'm quite satisfied as the care and staff are very good. It might be better if the calls were triaged in some way to help identify whether patients are more in need of an appointment than others as they are given on a fist come first served basis.  I've phoned both first thing and at lunch and still been told there are no appointments available at either.
Holbrook,Getting through is an issue,4/14/2023,4,Getting through on the phone to the surgery is the biggest issue but care from staff is good. I called about a week and a half ago for todays appointment with the nurse and I didn't think that was too bad.
Holbrook,good,7/3/2019,4,Always more than helpful and the service is always friendly and professional
Holbrook,good,7/3/2019,4,We are lucky to have a surgery and dispensary in the village.  I is very much appreciated
Holbrook,good,7/3/2019,4,".  To be able to book an advance appt.have the dr's approval almost .Really can't fault the doctors or nurse, they are brilliant.  It is frustrating that appts go very quickly and the way receptionist are."
Holbrook,good but with communication issues,6/17/2016,4,me a diagnosis have not really followed up or given me any advice about the condition or what to expect.  My daughter has had to find the information for us.  It would have been very nice if the GP had given us an org. to speak to
Holbrook,Good customer service,2/25/2019,5,Staff are very good at fitting the children in when they are unwell and generally getting appointments isn't bad and easy enough to do. Staff are polite and offer good customer service and are happy to answer questions.
Holbrook,Good experience,2/12/2022,4,I've found that appointments are fine to get and the staff are helpful and friendly and all my check-ups have been done when they should've been. All in all it's a good surgery.
Holbrook,Great service at Holbrook Surgery,9/4/2015,5,I can not rate our surgery high enough. You never feel that you are a nuisance and they do all they can to help. All staff are great.
Holbrook,Hard to get appointment,4/14/2023,3,"I was 19th in the queue when I first called but there were no appointments available so I called back at 13.00 as advised but there were none then either.  I've found that econsult has been closed at times so you have to call.  The system itself is longwinded but in this case it did get me an appointment today but I did have to wait 48hrs for a response although, this is what you are advised . It would be good to have a way of booking appointments in advance rather than having to do everything on the day which is very difficult around work and a family.  I have been offered a GP+ appointment as an alternative but nothing came of it and it was almost a waste of time as the doctor was unable to make a referral and I had to go back to the surgery again to get another appointment. I just feel it has taken longer than it needed to."
Holbrook,Just impossible to get an appointment,3/27/2023,1,"Tried and tried with no luck, waited and waited on phone and always no appointments left."
Holbrook,Long wait,7/19/2016,4,Sometimes long wait to see my named GP but otherwise first class service
Holbrook,Long waits on the phone,2/12/2022,4,You do have to wait on the phone for quite a  while before you can talk to reception and appointment availability can depend on who you talk to.  When you do see a doctor or nurse they are good and I've been happy with the care.
Holbrook,Occasionally you can't get in,5/13/2016,5,Occasionally you can't get in but depending on the urgency I can see a doctor that day or the next. Booking online works well for review etc. I really can't fault the surgery. I asked to discuss more than 1 issue and was allowed which is great. I joined the practice in the 1970's and have only had 3 doctors which is great.
Holbrook,Staff are fine,2/12/2022,3,I used to have regular monitoring appointments following a heart operation but as soon as covid hit all of it stopped and it's not restarted yet. I've got an annual review coming up soon so hoping it will all be covered then. Overall the surgery is ok and the staff are fine but I do feel its all a little more difficult to access it at the moment.
Holbrook,Staff are very good,12/14/2017,5,"They are very kind to me. The girls behind the desk are exceptional, they treat you as a person and not a nuisance. There is the flexibility to have longer"
Holbrook,Very friendly practice,8/12/2017,5,No fault at all. You phone up for appointments on the day which works well. very friendly practice.
Holbrook,Very quick today,4/14/2023,4,"I got through to the surgery very quickly today but did have to come to Holbrook rather than Shotley, which I would've preferred but it is more difficult to get them there now."
Holbrook,Very satisfied,4/14/2023,5,Very satisfied with the surgery it has all worked well when I've needed help.  It's hard when appointments are available at Shotley but the staff are very good and do all they can to help.
Holbrook,What is the point of having a “named” doctor?,5/25/2021,3,In 2 years I have had 4 different “named” doctors … no explanation from practice as to reason for changes … it may not matter for average patients but for a patient with a complex history it is impossible to build up a working relationship with a doctor … the practice claims it doesn’t matter because you can see other GP’s but a) that is not a reality when you can’t book an appointment for “routine” matters and you’re subject to the rota on the day you call and b) it makes having a named doctor a pointless tick box exercise! The practice is too focused on processes rather than meaningful relationships with patients with complex needs that might actually keep them out of hospital!
Holbrook,Works very well,5/12/2018,5,Its a good surgery where you can get appointments on the day you call for one and I see a lovely doctor. It all works very well for me.
Howard,3 misdiagnosees of cancer. Used telephone,10/29/2015,1,"I was very concerned about the shambolic ""organisation"" of the surgery. (My husband, who was recovering from stomach cancer, had his notes shredded by mistake, so the doctor on his initial visit asked my husband to guess the dosage of his tablets!) Also, it was not possible to get an appointment earlier than 3 weeks.  It was standard practice to give diagnoses over the phone in conversations with the duty doctor."
Howard,35 in queue,1/23/2020,3,"Rang at 8am on the dot today and there were 35 in front of me, so I can see the demand is high.  Working as I do though, makes it difficult to get the 'callback'.  I did have to come in, so wish that could have been offered at the start then I could arrange with work"
Howard,A lovely surgery,10/1/2018,4,"I have always found the staff at the surgery very kind and happy. My only issue now is that it is harder to get an appointment than it used to be. I know that this is a common issue and so because I know it, I have just accepted it."
Howard,Able to see a GP after 14:00 on a Friday,8/30/2018,5,I was working away from home (Sunday-Friday) and needed antibiotics for bronchitis before working away again from the Sunday.
Howard,Almost impossible to contact anyone!,4/20/2021,1,"When phoning it takes 1 minute 44 seconds of annoying pre-amble before being able to interact. Upon making selection I was transferred to an answering machine. The online system is poorly laid out and confusing; no best-practice user interface standards appear to have been followed. It appears to have been developed by a 16 year old after having read ""HTML for Dummies""."
Howard,Always a good service from this practice,7/23/2020,5,Have been with this surgery for many years and have always received an excellent service from doctors and staff. Highly recommended.
Howard,Always good at helping me.,5/1/2018,5,Always good at helping me and the boots pharmacy next door is fabulous.
Howard,Always really good,1/23/2020,5,"They are always really good at seeing the children on the day when ever we have needed them to be seen. Can be a little wait on the telephone, but it is understandable."
Howard,always the best,9/21/2020,5,always had and have a good experience whether in surgery or telephone
Howard,Amazing slickness giving flu jabs last Saturday,9/27/2020,5,"Welcoming, caring, professional, Covid safe."
Howard,Appalling.  No stars!!,7/13/2020,1,"Dr refused to come out and see my elderly father who was severely dehydrated and needed to be put on a drip as a matter of urgency.  When we requested that my father be admitted to hospital because he was so poorly he blankly refused saying hospital would be a shambles and would not be in my father's best interests.  Instead he let my father languish in bed for a further three weeks getting weaker and weaker despite several calls to Dr requesting a home visit.  Dr clearly thinks if you're over 85 you are well and truly past your sell-by date! However, eventually the paramedic from the surgery came out and was shocked to see the state my father was in saying he needed to go into hospital as a matter of urgency. They were fantastic and their swift action meant my father was in hospital within two hours.  Whilst Dr's lack of care was astonishing, I can't rate the paramedic, highly enough as she saved my father's life.  She really is first class."
Howard,Appointment management good,6/4/2019,4,I don't use the service much. Seeing a nurse today which is easy as they make the next appointment for you.
Howard,Appointment needed after 4pm,10/1/2018,4,When I needed an appointment after 4pm I had to go to the community hospital. This was very difficult for me as I could not drive as I was so unwell. I had to get a family member to take me which was a real inconvenience to them. I did not know about the system until I needed it.
Howard,Appointment with (name removed),4/11/2021,5,"Staff member was delightful,  excellent communicator, very understanding and very thorough."
Howard,Appointments go quickly,6/24/2022,4,"I was pleased to be offered an appointment today even when they said they were full. I have been trying for a few days. Appointments just go so quickly here. 27th in the queue today, rang dead on 8am and they were all gone by the time I got through."
Howard,Asked to call surgery to speak to doctors,9/21/2021,1,"No appointments available after a 30 minute wait on phone. Told to ring again next day, same thing happened."
Howard,Best GP ever,7/8/2020,5,"Such a kind, fantastic and professional team. Always happy to help. Genuinely caring. Best GP service I’ve ever experienced."
Howard,Brilliant,10/14/2019,5,Every Doctor/Nurse/professional I've seen have always been polite and help fantastically! I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. If it wasn't for this practise I dred to think how things would have turned out. Fantastic group of people!
Howard,Call back puts mind at rest,1/23/2020,5,I like the 'callback' as it puts your mind at rest and some things get resolved without the need to trek down to the surgery. All staff are very lovely on the telephone and face-to-face.  They always try to get you a resolution
Howard,Cannot fault it,2/21/2022,5,"I cannot fault the surgery. They are good at keeping up to date with my ongoing needs, of which I have many. Tests regularly dealt with and on time, check ups and good communication with me"
Howard,Cannot fault the surgery,6/4/2019,5,"Cannot fault the surgery.
I barely use the surgery but when I do I get an appointment. Today I was 21st in the queue - took 45 minutes to get through, but I have an appointment with my preferred GP."
Howard,Cannot get to talk to a human on the phone,5/24/2021,1,Rang to ask why my repeat prescription had not been sent to my chemist. Not able to speak to anyone. Left a message and no one rang back. Tried the website but you need an id and password. To get one it says contact the surgery and hence I was back where I started.
Howard,Can't fault the service that's provided,9/25/2020,5,"I have been at this practise for a lifetime, and they have the most marvellous staff possible. Can't fault them.."
Howard,Can't fault this practice,8/15/2020,5,Have been at this practice for many years. Most helpful and caring.That's everyone not just the drs all staff. The receptionists can't do enough to help you.
Howard,Concerned about next time,8/3/2023,2,"I had bad flu like symptoms and I could not get a face to face appointment, they kept telling me to phone back the next day at 8am, I did that for a few days and still could not get a face to face appointment. I have asthma and they know that I have asthma but they still wouldn't see me. I then went to the pharmacy who told me that I had a chest infection and that I must see a GP, so I went back to the GP surgey and told them what the pharmacy said. They told me this time that the GP would call me back at 5pm that day, they then made me an appointment with the asthma nurse 3 weeks later and gave me steroids. I am concerned about going back in the future."
Howard,Consistently good,10/4/2017,5,I find this surgery is consistently fine.  Care has changed and change takes time to get used to.  They changed the appointment system to the triage way and I didn't know until I needed an appointment.  I guess it works better for the surgery but not sure it does for a majority of patients
Howard,Difficult to access appointments,6/4/2019,4,Gaining access to appointments when you work is very difficult. I was on hold whilst at work and by the time I was 1st in the queue I was called into a work meeting and had to call back later. Never been offered a GP+ appointment.
Howard,Difficult to get an appointment,2/25/2019,4,"I have been trying to get an appointment and it has been difficult.  I feel a call from a GP is wasting time as I know I will need to be seen.  I understand that others may not, but feel it would be better to educate people so they do not call in the first place thinking they need to see a GP, then those who do will get the appointments they need and GP's won't be wasting their time needing to make 'phone calls."
Howard,Dissappointed with blood pressure checks,6/27/2023,2,"My annual blood pressure checks are supposed to happen, I havent been asked to go in now for five years."
Howard,Do not know who I am seeing,6/3/2019,3,"Rang at 8 am today, waited for my call back which was pretty quick and they said 'just come up' so I am here, not knowing a particular appointment time or who I will be seen by."
Howard,Do not like the 'call back',1/23/2020,4,"I usually get in when I need one.  I do not like the 'callback' as I know I need to be seen face-to-face when something has a 'visual' symptom such as a lump.  Just feel it wastes vital time, both mine and the professionals.  Staff here are always very pleasant."
Howard,Doctors are very approachable,3/14/2016,4,The doctors are very approachable and interested in you. The only issue is that we see a different doctor all the time so there is little continuity.
Howard,Doesn't cater for night workers,8/11/2021,1,"In a town whos predominate industry is the 24 hour a day port, it strikes me as ridiculous that you cannot ring after getting out of bed from a nightshift and ring up for an appointment. Apparently you HAVE to ring in the morning, really handy if you work nights like so many do in Felixstowe ???? so just centre everything around the 9 to 5 then thanks."
Howard,Done their best for us,7/18/2023,4,"We have found the service absolutely fine. We have had various referrals, resulting in toe surgery soon for me and knee/hip surgery for my partner. These were delayed due to Covid but the surgery have done their best for us in this time getting us into physio. Our movement really did depreciate though and need to get something to keep us going after the surgery."
Howard,Don't like seeing the Student,1/23/2020,4,"Been under this surgery all my life.  Staff are very polite and helpful.  I do find the telephone system difficult sometimes, in getting an appointment.  On a couple of occasions, I have seen the 'student' doctor, but only told when I arrive, and at that point, it is really difficult to say 'no'.  My GP is excellent and that is who I believe I am seeing when I arrive, I then feel less confident when it is sprung upon me that I will be seeing the student."
Howard,Easy to get appointment,9/11/2018,5,"I know the system takes a bit longer, but I think this is why when I need an appointment I always get one. It seems to have stopped people who can be spoken to and advised over the phone taking up appointments."
Howard,Emergency treatment for my wife,6/19/2021,5,Excellent service doctor was brilliant
Howard,Excellent,7/9/2017,5,Very good and caring surgery
Howard,Excellent,7/9/2017,5,Everything is fine
Howard,Excellent,4/24/2017,5,"I do not use the surgery often, but when I need it I can get an appointment on the day.  The triage system works well for me"
Howard,Excellent,10/4/2017,5,"Never had any issues.  Do not use the surgery much though and only found out about any of the changes today, so that is a bit poor.  Currently they won't affect me but as I get older that surely will change"
Howard,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,We've been with the surgery for many years.  The receptionists are very welcoming.  Waiting times are generally good and I'm happy to see any of the doctors
Howard,excellent,12/4/2016,5,"Lady with sight loss was initially dubious about the system whereby the doctor calls you back, but now thinks it works really well."
Howard,Excellent,12/4/2016,5,I never have any problems at the surgery.  I feel I do not need them as often as some people do though.
Howard,Excellent all round,7/9/2017,5,Everything always fine.  No problems getting appointments
Howard,excellent appointments on the day,6/14/2016,5,They offer a fantastic service - we can even get appointments on the day
Howard,Excellent but don't like triage system,4/24/2017,5,Do not like triage system.  Note of concern at being able to see own GP.  The after 3  pm appointment at Felixstowe  Community Hospital concerns me as I can see any GP.  Good though that computer system links all appointments
Howard,Excellent but worry about mix ups with medecines,4/24/2017,5,"Having COPD I get appointments fine.  What is a concern is when I pick up my medication and the pharmacy have changed something,which I query but they say that the GP has changed it but my GP has not told me.  Sometimes medications can be mixed up so I always question it just in case it has happened tome"
Howard,Excellent but...,12/4/2016,5,Things can be delayed when trying to get an appointment.
Howard,Excellent experience but would like to get repeat prescription over the 'phone,7/9/2017,5,My experience is very good at this surgery.  I wish I coud still get a repeat prescription by calling the surgery as I struggle always to walk and put my repeat in
Howard,Excellent service,1/23/2020,5,"always found this service to be excellent.  Today we are 5 minutes late in getting here, but they are still seeing us.  Staff are very lovely and welcoming and were not unkind about the fact that we were late."
Howard,Excellent service,2/25/2019,5,This is an excellent service which works very well for me and my family.
Howard,"Excellent, can always get appointment",4/24/2017,5,"Can always get appointment when need it.  Good prescription service, getting a text when when ready in pharmacy is handy."
Howard,fair,6/21/2016,2,Hard to get appointment.  Triage system but doesn't always call back  Once they diagnosed tonsillitis over phone and put antibiotic prescription in for me.  It didn't work
Howard,fair,12/4/2016,3,Still do NOT like having to ring in and wait
Howard,fair,12/4/2016,3,Some receptionist very helpful; some not.  Seeing the same doctor of your choice is most important. Prescriptions take too long.  Not enough privacy when speaking to receptionists
Howard,Fair. Hard to understand a treatment explanation from GP,7/9/2017,3,I was spoken to about something quite complex.  It was put to me very factually but not much by way of explanation in terms I understood
Howard,Fantastic!,6/4/2021,5,Rang to ask about mum's care in her care home and they were able to confirm that I have permission to access her care and provided me with the info I needed. Kind and caring. Nothing was too much trouble.
Howard,Feel there is 'no time to care',2/25/2019,3,"I have had mixed experiences here. In general I feel that there is no longer the 'time to care', you feel rushed although most of the time the surgery runs late (at least 20 minutes)."
Howard,"Friendly staff, they leave no stone unturned",10/3/2020,5,It s the level of joined up thinking and processes that are exemplary. The staff work together to treat ailments and have an excellent reminder service for blood tests etc on which they always follow up. I would not go anywhere else!
Howard,Get appointments easily,9/11/2018,5,Whenever I have needed to see someone face to face they have always accommodated me. I have no complaints.
Howard,Good,7/9/2017,4,Overall very good.  The local collaboration has seemed not to affect patients.  I have had an appointment at Felixstowe General and I did not mind as I needed to see someone the same day.
Howard,Good,4/24/2017,4,Been at surgery 40 years.  Not had issues.  Times have changed.  More needs to be done so people know what the clinics at Felixstowe Community Hospital offer as they are under-used and people travel to Ipswich when they could go there
Howard,Good,4/24/2017,4,Like the triage system.  I often have my mind put at rest by GP on the telephone but when I need an appointment I get one
Howard,Good,10/4/2017,4,Regularly here due to my illness.  Find everything very good.  I do not mind the triage service as we are retired.  With a lifetime condition I do tend to see my own GP.  Worried that will change under the new collaboration in the area.
Howard,good,7/3/2019,4,During the visit practitioner was using book and internet to compare pictures with the skin issue my 5 year old had.  poor knowledge
Howard,good,7/3/2019,4,"The treatment for the children has always been good, and the triage system as it saves me having to attend the surgery unnecessarily"
Howard,good,12/4/2016,4,"Getting through on phone takes a lot of time but surgery runs on time. 
Don't get seen, diagnosis always by phone.  
Pharmacy helps more than doctors with treatment explanation."
Howard,Good,12/4/2016,4,Getting an appointment takes too long.  Not always running on time when you you do have one
Howard,Good,12/4/2016,4,Sometimes things need to be explained more simply and clearly to me as I am hard of hearing
Howard,Good but communication could be better and so could contituity,10/4/2017,4,Communication about changes to the surgery could be better.  Never usually see the same GP.  Felixstowe has an elderly population who have that need to see same person but changes are made and we all have to change with it.
Howard,Good but concerned about collaboration service,10/4/2017,4,"This surgery runs well for me as I barely need it.  We are actually kept ""an eye on"" by staff as it has a nurse who called us to say we needed to come in.  I am concerned that less appointments will be available under the collaboration due to 3  surgeries having 1 ''on the day' team at the community hospital"
Howard,Good but electronic notifcation to see GP is too quick,10/4/2017,4,I have to ensure I sit at the front otherwise I cannot see my name when it comes up on the screen as it only appears once with a light bleep sound that you could easily miss.  It would help if it came up a couple of times or stayed on screen longer
Howard,Good but long wait for blood tests,4/24/2017,4,Blood tests at Felixstowe Community hospital .can wait 2 weeks to get it.  I mainly see a nurse at my surgery
Howard,Good but screen system needs improving,10/4/2017,4,Overall a good surgery.  I find the screen system for telling me when it's my turn a little difficult as I can easily be occupying my child and miss our name or the room to go into as it doesn't stay up long enough.
Howard,Good but unhappy with treatment explanation,4/24/2017,4,Feel unhappy with explanation of condition.  More detail required by mother
Howard,Good but very rude reception staff,10/4/2017,4,I wish to change surgeries due to rudeness of staff - reception
Howard,Good but worried about continuity of service,10/4/2017,4,"Overall I find the surgery fits my needs.  If I had an ongoing condition, not seeing the same GP woud be challenging.  With the collaboration it seems less likely that that will happen for everyone"
Howard,Good for my family so far,7/18/2023,5,"We all come to this surgery and as we are reasonably healthy, we do not need to come often. We have been able to access information we need, and tend to go to the pharmacy first for most simple things. I used AskMyGP and found it easy to use, but it is not for everyone. It suits me due to my work and/or school run. They are quick to let you know if you need to take action/come in to see someone, although the latter generally is less often."
Howard,Good service overall,6/3/2019,5,The service for me has consistently been good for me.  It runs a little late on most of my visits.
Howard,Good telephone booking system,6/1/2017,4,There is a good telephone booking system service-it is thorough and efficient
Howard,Good. No problem getting appointments but can be a wait at the surgery,7/9/2017,4,Not always running on time but I generally have no problem getting an appointment
Howard,Good. Ring back system works well,7/9/2017,4,The ring back service works really well for me.  I always get a call within 1/2 hour and usualy get an appointment if needed.  I was initially sceptical about this proces but I think it really works well
Howard,GPs need to listen to their patient,8/16/2018,4,"Some GPs are more patient than others. Also, they will only talk about one problem at a time and one would need to book another appointment for any extra issues. Triage system for appointment isn't great. GPs need to listen to their patients."
Howard,Hard to make an appointment,5/31/2016,3,It is hard to make an appointment. Have to phone and then maybe you will get an appointment. I liked the old times when you 'phoned in and got an appointment.
Howard,Helpful staff,2/21/2022,4,"I came in with my 'sample' in a container of my own. I was directed to use one of theirs, but it was difficult to understand what I needed to do. A member of staff came out and helped me sort it out.  With everything so busy and this situation being a bit sensitive, I was very pleased with them."
Howard,I feel well looked after here,6/4/2019,5,I feel well looked after here. I see mainly the same GP for an ongoing condition.
Howard,I have always had a very positive experience.,12/5/2021,5,"I usually consult with Dr. He his very attentive and caring and discusses my care and needs which gives me every reassurance in my health care provision. When I have interacted with other medical professionals in the practise, my experience has been very positive."
Howard,I have filled in the form on line but will not work,10/20/2020,1,Site not working properly
Howard,I just want a non-urgent conversation,7/1/2021,1,"Renewing my blue badge. NHS now say they will not accept surgery diagnosis, only hospital clinician. What do I do? You don't have an email contact, and I know I can spend 40 minutes waiting for the phone to answer - which I pay for."
Howard,I'm deaf. It's not easy to make an appointment,4/4/2019,3,Can't hear telephone
Howard,"Kind, helpful, excellent level of care",7/11/2020,5,"Howard House Surgery is amazing. The reception staff are very helpful and friendly. The quality of care I have received has been fantastic. My doctor, for many years, is always kind, caring and perceptive. The surgery has continued offering an excellent level of care throughout the coronavirus epidemic. Such a valuable service to the community!"
Howard,Little while getting what I need,7/18/2023,3,"On the whole things are ok here. It however can sometimes take a bit longer than you would think to get what you need. I feel this is because you do not ever see a GP first, but someone else then when that is not resolved, you try again and see a non-GP again. For me if it is the same thing twice you should then see a GP if the initial assessment has not solved the issue."
Howard,Lovely staff,6/7/2022,5,This surgery has been very good even during the difficult times of covid. For me it is because the staff are always lovely even when they cannot get you what you would hope to have.
Howard,Medically excellent. Webpage not excellent,4/20/2020,4,"The prescription request system via the webpage is incorrect and misleading.  On my wife's medicine record, as written on webpage the supply of medicines indicates supply even of a controlled drug a date in the future. EG ""Last supplied on 28th April"" yet the page was being viewed on 7th April. ( I have a screen record).  Nowhere on the website does it explain why the dates are intended supply dates, Just dates in the future that the medicines have been supplied in the past. The pharmacy is also not aware of the procedure.  The phoned explanation is ""That is what I have been told to do"" Nub of the complaint is that their repeat prescription page is badly written and unexplained. I say this as a pharmacist and as one who can produce a trophy for website programming, I won a £1,000 prize for webpage design.  It is wrong to enter onto a computer record the supply of medicines that has not yet taken place."
Howard,Mixed experience,6/9/2018,4,"I do not feel there is a consistent method of getting an appointment. Admittedly I have not used the surgery in some time and so the system must have changed, so it came as a surprise to me when I had to wait for a call back. I did get an appointment, and I knew already that I did need to see someone. It just feels like there are so many more hoops to jump through to get to the person you need to see. It is more time consuming for me, which is a bit annoying."
Howard,Much better than other one,2/25/2019,4,"This surgery is much better than the other surgery I used to be at in Felixstowe, where my partner received poor care a few weeks ago.  We came here and my partner is already receiving better care along with physio and awaiting an MRI with possible need of surgery."
Howard,My prescription review left me short,9/11/2018,3,"They reviewed my prescription. I am type 2 but on insulin so h ave to do a prick test twice a day minimum. they changed the needles to shorter ones and the test papers, I was allocated 100. This means I now have to put in the prescription more frequently now.Not sure why it was changed as they always lasted me the full 3 months before."
Howard,never any problems,9/28/2021,5,I started 64 years ago when the surgery was in Leopold Road and since then never had a worry about getting treatment or to see a doctor/nurse
Howard,Never had a problem even during pandemic,1/14/2021,5,if i require help it is always there in person or on the phone
Howard,No blood tests here,2/25/2019,4,"Do not know why, but you cannot get blood tests done here. You have to go to the Community hospital.  Other surgeries do it in Felixstowe so do not know why ours do not.
(HWS CDO was able to explain this after speaking to the PM)"
Howard,Often run behind schedule,6/4/2019,4,"Running behind today which is common, but I got a callback from the GP quite quickly."
Howard,Only my 2nd visit,9/11/2018,5,"I have only ever visited here twice, as new to the area. I have a learning disability and they always talk to me in a way that I understand and is respectful, so that I know what is going on. I come with my support worker, but they do talk to me and not to them."
Howard,Outstanding practice,10/27/2021,5,"Just reliably helpful, friendly and available."
Howard,Palliative care of bladder cancer patient.,12/21/2018,5,"The surgery staff showed compassion, were helpful and provided good medical care."
Howard,Phone call never came,7/18/2023,3,"I have had a number of delays, all starting with when I was waiting on a telephone call appointment that never came back earlier this year.  This was over a big health concern where my partner ended up in hospital later on the next day. I wish appointments to be gradually released throughout the day rather than this stress of phoning at 8am."
Howard,"Poor, lack of continuity",4/5/2017,1,Lack of continuity - never sees same GP  and offerred a telephone appointment when he feels he should be seen in person
Howard,Prescription review,9/11/2018,3,"I do not know who does the reviews, but when they do they change the supplier which does not agree with my body. So then I have to ring up, see the GP and sort it out. I wish they would not meddle with it. It ends up using up more resources as I have to come and see the GP about it."
Howard,Professional helpful staff,3/12/2021,5,"Couldn't be happier with Howard House. 
Everyone  is do helpful, my experience with the GP's to the Receptionists, nurses is excellent. I feel really well supported by the practice."
Howard,"professional, friendly; appropriate care",12/10/2018,5,treated like a thinking adult
Howard,Prompt response,7/3/2019,4,Telephone first thing and got a phone call from GP within 5 minutes.  Appointment this morning.  Very pleased at prompt response
Howard,Prompt service,7/3/2019,5,"Received a very prompt call back and GP said just to pop along, which I did not expect.  It is really good and wonder if system has changed to a 'drop-in' as I was not given a time.  Surgery is the quietest I have seen in a long time."
Howard,"Prompt, sympathetic and friendly.",10/14/2019,5,"I realise you were all very busy today, but as usual response was timely and extremely helpful. Have nothing but praise for doctors and all staff at the practice. Only wish I didn’t have to bother you so often!!"
Howard,Quick call back from GP,9/11/2018,4,"I do not use the surgery very often, but when I do it can take a while to get into the system for waiting in the queue.  I was number 6 this morning, then a GP rang me back within 15 minutes and gave me an appointment this morning. I feel it is a good system apart from initially trying to get through"
Howard,Quiet yet busy,7/18/2023,3,"You are told there is limited appointments, yet when you come in the surgery is quiet, yet they say how busy they are.
It gives me the impression that there are many phone call appointments happening, or barely any staff in to see people face to face. They are all lovely people when you do see them."
Howard,Rang for appointment,9/24/2018,1,"And so.. After quick automated message the phone started to ring so I assumed I was in the queue. However, with no indication as to where I was in the queue and phone rang for over 5 mins I just gave up"
Howard,Rapid referrals,6/4/2019,5,"Husband had a worrying time and saw the GP, during the appointment a referral was made to Dermatology departments. By that afternoon we had had a call for 2 weeks time. My husband went in and all was dealt with in an hour at the hospital."
Howard,Really responsive,1/23/2020,5,"Rang at 10.30am, callback came maximum 10 minutes later and were were asked to come in as soon as we are able. Cannot ask for a better service than that really."
Howard,Recently joined this surgery.,12/15/2020,5,"After previous surgery closed. The reception staff are friendly. The quality of care I have received in a short time has been fantastic. Other family members have echoed this response. The doctor, who I have started seeing is kind and caring: heard other GPs in the practice also provide a high standard of care and are professional and personable. 
Have yet to find fault with this surgery."
Howard,Receptionist was very rude,8/2/2021,1,I call the surgery as I work in a supported living house and a client had taken medication and spat it out. I was rudely told by the receptionist that it’s common sense just to give another tablet. She was very rude and said she would consult with a colleague on reception then said yes common sense give another tablet. When I asked her name as this is needed for our paperwork she said she and I have asked someone else. I was not rude to this receptionist but found her extremely rude and patronising
Howard,Refused to do referrals,8/22/2021,3,"My neck was damaged by a chiropractor. My GP told me it was wear and tear and age. They would not listen, refused x ray, refused MRI. I paid privately - two bulging discs and occipital nerve damage."
Howard,Ring back is good,9/11/2018,4,"When I need an appointment, I always get on. I think the ring back system works very well."
Howard,Ring back system,9/11/2018,3,"I am not keen on the ring back system. Today we called, waited through the telephone message which goes on for a while, only then to be told that the call could not be completed. Very annoying. So we called later, we then received a call back from the GP who then made me an appointment. We just feel a face to face assessment is much better. Seeing you is half the battle on diagnosing and determining their needs. Just not happy with this change at all."
Howard,Staff - great. Appointment system - abysmal.,8/10/2021,3,"After a telephone appointment, I ended up going to the emergency doctor. I can't understand why it  is so difficult  to see a GP. It has already taken more NHS time for the original problem. But when you do actually get to see them, the staff are great."
Howard,telephone conversation helpful,7/21/2020,5,i have always been treated with care and dignity and the staff always polite
Howard,Telephone system works,6/4/2019,4,"I called and was 19th in the queue, so left it a while and called again and was 12th. I called 15 minutes later and was 3rd in the queue, so the system works OK, but I have circumstances where I can call back like that."
Howard,Thank you,9/13/2020,5,"The doctor examined my feet on Friday. I found him to be extremely thorough, gentle, and very courteous and polite. A credit to any health organisation. Thank you very much"
Howard,They've always been good to me.,5/15/2021,5,"Been with them for years. Attentive and compassionate doctors who try to work with my complex and unusual issues. Doctors get back to you in good time, staff in general are very polite and the prescription lady in particular is great, and goes above and beyond her specific duties. This job is surely stressful as anything but they do excellent work."
Howard,Thorough,6/11/2021,5,The staff here are very thorough and investigate issues completely until diagnosis. I feel like my concerns were heard and al my symptoms were looked at. I’m still waiting for a referral but that’s not the fault of the GP
Howard,Time wasted,8/23/2021,1,"After a telephone conversation, I was informed a MH form and prescription would be at reception. I walked 2 miles and told it was not there, and told it will be the next door pharmacy. I went and asked, they didn't have them. I then go back to the GP and magically a form appeared, but no prescription. Receptionist left the area and I waited. I left as I was extremely annoyed and did not want to lose my temper. My depression is at crisis point, and I expected more from my GP surgery. Instead I am left unable to rely on them, along with other health care professions. I ask for help and get nothing. Thanks."
Howard,Timely call back,2/21/2022,4,"Today I have had a timely callback and been asked to come in. It does save unnecessary time for me as they have been able to give me prescriptions without appointments, which I think is fine for those particular things."
Howard,"Timely referrals, treatment & support.",10/21/2021,5,"My experiences are good, supported through treatment & all staff have been so very kind."
Howard,Told to stand out side in the freezing cold,11/12/2020,1,"My mum is 82, she went to doctors on the 7th Dec. She had an appointment, receptionist asked her if she had had a covid test, my mum explained that she had just had one prior to having a cateract operation, the hospital said that if it came back positive she would be told and wouldn't be allowed to have the operation, the operation went ahead on the 19 Nov therefore her covid test was negative. Mum explained all of this the the receptionist. However they told her to move back from the door, the doors then closed in front of her. Then was told to go round to the side door which she did but no one came, she then spent ages out side in the freezing cold she banged and banged on the door, eventually she was let in. The Dr was excellent and allowed her to warm up in her office. Now she us so unwell with sickness and constant diarrhea. I find it outrageous that the reception left my 82 year old mum out in the freezing for this length of time. They clearly were not attentive to what she was telling them. They clearly need training in customer care. I have attempted to find a complaints email. I will be taking this appalling treatment further. Im totally disgusted."
Howard,Unable to book a telephone consult,7/14/2021,2,I was asked to book a telephone consult with the doctor. When I ring I am number 28 in a queue. I ring back several times and eventually get through to be told there’s no more appointments. I ask to be put down for the next day. Sorry I can’t. I have tried to find the e-consult service on the website but can’t. Very very poor service!!!!
Howard,Unable to book appointment,9/30/2021,2,On hold for 25minutes and then unable to book an appointment as they’d all gone. I understand these are difficult times but there must be a better system to speak to a doctor about a non emergency issue?? This has happened twice.
Howard,Unaware of surgeries collaboration,4/24/2017,4,Did not know about the  surgeries collaboration  .Concerned about how I would get to the hospital as do not drive and if very unwell would not want to walk.  Pleased to hear about the paramedics being re-united
Howard,Uncaring/unsympathetic,9/23/2020,2,"For the second time this Doctor was rude, unhelpful and totally uncaring"
Howard,Underwhelmed,7/8/2021,1,"My mum who has been a patient at this practice for the past 45 years and now is being dismissed due to her age. She is suffering from severe pain and would like to be referred to a specialist but instead she was told “do you know you have 83 year old bones” as he walked out. Totally unprofessional, rude and disrespectful."
Howard,Unhappy about collaboration,4/24/2017,4,Although there are 7 GPS here I only want to see mine and check what the rota is to ensure that I can see mine.  I only feel this way as I have a serious ongoing medical condition.  I am not happy about the  surgery collaboration either; as they bring the time forward it will mean less and less chance of seeing your own GP.
Howard,Use the phone not online,7/18/2023,4,"I always use the phone even though they always ask if you can use online. I cannot use online as eye sight not the best, but I am not wanting to purchase the equipment just to use to make a GP appointment, as would not use it for anything else at my age. They are helpful once we get past that initial hurdle, but I do get sick of being asked it each time. I would not be ringing in if I could use it."
Howard,Very disappointed!,6/15/2021,1,"What do you have to do to get an actual appointment with a doctor at this practice? It's impossible!, and it's not the fault of the reception staff."
Howard,Very friendly,9/25/2018,5,"Check-up at local surgery, very friendly and helpful."
Howard,Very frustrating,7/2/2019,1,"You have to wait far too long for the phone to be answered.  Do not like being asked by the Receptionist what the problem is, particularly when the Doctor eventually rings back she asks what the problem is.  We all have lives to live and cannot be tied to a telephone 24/7."
Howard,Very frustrating trying to get an appointment,12/11/2019,1,"When you telephone for an appointment at 08.00 exactly, the system rejects you and terminates the call. But by one minute past 08.00 you can be number thirty five in the queue. I don’t have time while at work to hang on the phone waiting for thirty four others to be dealt with. You cannot walk in and make an appointment, and anyway, once the day’s appointments are taken, you cannot book one for the next day. In addition, if you have been told that you need a medication review after a blood test, trying to do this through reception or the prescriptions desk is futile. You still have to phone to get a doctor to call you back. Do the doctors not respond to e mail messages left by the prescription desk. A system which is totally unfit for purpose."
Howard,Very good service,6/4/2019,5,"Very good service.
Yes, it has taken a while to get through but if you need to see someone that's bearable."
Howard,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,4,"The surgery is very good, but I barely use it. I find the only thing I feel they could look at, is the phone system as it is either engaged or you get through. I do not recall being on a 'call waiting' system (although this was explained that this is used here)."
Howard,Very supportive,6/24/2022,5,They have been very supportive to us as a family in more ways than one since transplant surgery has happened. Feel like they are very caring and thoughtful and they 'know' you.
Howard,Very well looked after,5/9/2018,4,"I have found the surgery to be excellent with the way you feel looked after in particular. Things have changed here over the last year, but the care has not suffered.
The changes have meant that it seems to take longer to get an appointment, as you have to be called/assessed first"
Howard,Waiting at appointment not great,10/1/2018,4,"I can understand if a clinic is a 'drop-in', that you would expect to wait for a while. I however always have an appointment and find waiting beyond 20mins for my time a bit difficult as I have conditions that mean I need the toilet regularly. I would not feel comfortable telling the staff as the waiting room is very open."
Howard,waiting for referrals,7/18/2023,3,"I have the need for a referral, but when you do not see a GP you do not get them as quickly. This concerns me, as if there was something a bit more sinister going on, a delay can be more of an issue. There feels like more hoops to jump through to get the treatment you need."
Howard,Waiting for telephone system is frustrating,6/4/2019,3,"Do not like the system used here. On hold for ages before getting through, then wait for ages for the GP to call back. You cannot get on with anything."
Howard,Waits on telephone,12/4/2016,4,Have to wait far too long when trying to get through on the phone for appointment
Howard,Works well,2/25/2019,4,"Although things are different to how they used to be, I find it all works well for me at this particular moment in time. It takes a bit longer to see someone (need a call back first), but I understand the 'why' behind it and so I am fine with that."

Ivry,accommodating,9/22/2016,4,They are very accommodating most of the time
Ivry,Always been most helpful and pleasent,2/21/2021,5,Have always been given an appointment when needed and very good with dealing with my needle phobia most understaing
Ivry,Always helpful. Staff are fantastic,1/17/2022,5,We have been using the surgery for over ten years. They have always been great and are very well organised. They have handled sensitive issues with my teenage daughter with the upmost care. I really wouldn’t want to go anywhere else
Ivry,Annoyed at the time but later understood,6/21/2019,3,"I waited 2 weeks for an appointment. I had a problem with my jaw/ear. I tried to get an appointment sooner but i couldn't. The doctor checked my ear but didn't give me anything medicine. I was told i could go to the dentist and get checked out but the doctor wouldn't do anything. I was given some information. I was annoyed at the time, but later on i understood why the doctor just gave me information rather than medication."
Ivry,Better continuity of care,7/9/2015,4,Having better continuity of care would have made a secondary condition quicker to diagnose. By seeing different doctors all the time meant it was missed.
Ivry,Can't fault them,6/27/2023,4,I can't fault them. The attitude of the staff is good and I feel that some of them know me well. I have always been happy with the medical staff. Getting an appointment is ok for me. I find that when I really need them they 'come up trumps'. They really looked after my husband when he was alive.
Ivry,Difficult to get an appointment,3/28/2017,3,It is difficult to get an appointment here-it can take between 2 and 4 weeks
Ivry,Drs. very helpful,6/1/2017,5,"The doctors in this surgery are very helpful, straightforward and kind- as are the reception staff"
Ivry,Easy to book,6/15/2022,5,Easy to get my blood test today. We have had a few face to face appointments too and it has been relatively easy to book them by calling into the surgery.  The phone system is good and don't have to wait too long in the queue before answered.
Ivry,Everyone helpful,8/15/2016,5,Everyone helpful and friendly.  Can always see a doctor or nurse.
Ivry,excellent,9/14/2017,5,The doctors are friendly and talk to me in the appointment.  I'd like to have some magazines for children my age
Ivry,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I am very happy with the service my surgery provides.  They offer late appts and are very accommodating with emergency appts as well
Ivry,excellent,9/14/2017,5,You can always get an appointment with a doctor quite quickly
Ivry,Excellent,6/7/2016,5,This is an excellent all round surgery.
Ivry,Excellent care from all members of staff,7/1/2016,5,"I felt well cared for from the moment I called. The 
Gp triaged over the phone and then saw me the same day and was approachable and courteous. I felt well informed about the action planned and free to ask any questions. When I had my blood test the lay was very pleasant and protected my privacy at all times, she was efficient and kind throughout."
Ivry,Excellent GP,9/17/2019,4,Excellent GP - The doctor treats patients with respect ALL WAYS.
Ivry,fair,6/21/2016,3,Booking to see a specific doctor can mean long 2 - 3 week wait and to see any doctor can take time as well
Ivry,Fair. Difficult to get appointments.,4/18/2017,3,Difficult to get an appointment.  Appointments can be 2--4 weeks in future
Ivry,Fantastic Team!,1/14/2020,5,I think the team at Ivry Street are extremely responsive to patient need.  I can always get an appointment if I need one urgently on the day and I am impressed by the high quality of care provided by all.
Ivry,First rate service,6/15/2022,5,"This is a first rate service. With many health conditions I do get looked after well. Ringing in and getting a face to face appointment is very easy for us. When I was given medication that didn't agree with me, it was sorted out in a few days. Today, I have a double appointment which is great as I can look at my conditions and how they relate to each other to try and make some headway on now as I am struggling."
Ivry,Flawless GP consultation,4/30/2015,5,"I visited my GP to receive the results of some tests. He was courteous, friendly, unhurried, and expansive. He answered all my questions and gave me effective sound advice about my lifestyle."
Ivry,"Given time, never hurried",6/7/2017,5,"You are given time when it is needed - never hurried. Excellent doctors who stay with the practice so you get continuity. Treatment excellent.
Receptionists are welcoming and helpful - do not see their job as protecting the doctors from patients."
Ivry,good,7/3/2019,4,I like how the physio is based at the surgery and I don't have problems getting appointments
Ivry,good,7/3/2019,4,Cwhen I need one an't fault service really as I do not use it much.  I usually can get an appointment
Ivry,Good access,2/5/2016,5,You can always get an appointment with a doctor quite quickly.
Ivry,Good but some staff can be moody but they are under pressure. Doctors helpful.,7/8/2017,5,"Overall very helpful but some staff moody but under quite a bit of pressure. Long waiting times now for doctor's appointment. But doctors are very helpful and understanding,"
Ivry,Good surgery,11/24/2016,4,"A good surgery, never had any problems and I've been there for years"
Ivry,Great Nurses,4/29/2015,5,I have twice weekly visits by the nurses  to treat a leg ulcer and I cant fault the nursing staff. They have been very good  and I tend to see the same nurses most days which is great.
Ivry,Happy here,6/22/2022,5,We are happy here. The staff are friendly and approachable. When you ring in you get through quickly.
Ivry,Helped me a lot,7/15/2016,4,I have now been prescribed medicine that is helping.  I either go to the surgery to make an appointment or my husband phones for me.  I take my husband or a friend to translate for me.  I have been on a number of occasions about breathing difficulty.  Last time I was prescribed a ventrilin inhaler which has helped me a lot.
Ivry,Knowing it is dealt with that day,6/15/2022,5,"I have only had issues once with calling into the surgery - waiting in the telephone queue for 45 mins then getting cut off! However, it must have been a one-off glitch as since then I have been pleased with a quick response and seen a GP with my ongoing condition. 
I will look at E-Consult, but only if it was for something that was not needing to be addressed urgently as 'online' consultations, do not give me confidence in knowing that things will be dealt with or seen the day you put them in. This is especially true when I feel I need access to the service for my children."
Ivry,Long wait to see a nurse practitioner,7/16/2015,3,I've waited 18 days to see a nurse practitioner.
Ivry,More additional services woud be great,7/16/2015,4,I would like to see more additional services here including some complimentary medicine e.g. more acupuncture / general wellbeing health etc
Ivry,Much better now,6/15/2022,5,"During covid I was unable to get an appointment, like most people I guess, but I was worried about some things. Today I was 17 in the queue but spoken to in about 10 minutes and offered a face to face appointment for about an hour later. Really cannot complain at that, when you hear of other places struggling more, I feel very fortunate to be under this surgery."
Ivry,No rapport,8/2/2019,2,"Quite impersonal, you don't see the same person for appointments so you can't build a rapport with anyone. You can't see who you'd like to see if its urgent.  At times I don't feel listened to and notes aren't read before you see them and because you're not known this really doesn't help."
Ivry,No treatment given,5/31/2016,5,"I fell off of a horse onto concrete, my arm is still not right and no treatment given."
Ivry,Not good if you have ASD,11/19/2020,1,"I picked out this surgery as the reviews were good however the registration ended up in the shredder. The first lady I spoke to was lovely but the second lady when I came down to actually register was exceptionally rude and gave incorrect information and was very unwelcoming, I can never comment on the doctors but if you cannot get past the receptionists it’s not the surgery for me , when you have ASD it’s so difficult to navigate health care and receptionists just make you scared."
Ivry,Really good surgery,9/14/2018,5,"The website I find very useful and easy to navigate. I personally use it to order my prescriptions and that is easy too. I have not used E-Consult though as I have not been asked to, and it is easy to get through on the telephone and been seen very easily as a result"
Ivry,Really great very well organised,4/2/2021,5,Everyone was in and out no waiting only for 20 minutes stay to make sure no reaction
Ivry,See the same doctor,10/12/2018,5,I get very good support provided by the surgery and generally see the same doctor. I can get appointments within a couple of days or if you're happy to see anyone it will be quicker.
Ivry,Still excellent,5/31/2016,4,I have been with this surgery for more than 25 years. There have been many changes but it is still excellent!
Ivry,System works for me,6/15/2022,5,"I have found that this surgery has been adaptable through Covid, but still very accessible. You get through on the telephone reasonably quickly and if I think I need to come in, they are very amenable. I do not use online and have never been asked to use it instead of calling in."
Ivry,The e-consult option is great!,7/26/2022,5,"I've recently used the surgery's e-consult option from their website and found it to be excellent. I've often felt in the past that I've had to make an appointment to simply ask a GP a question or for a bit of advice. Using the e-consult service means you get a relatively prompt response without having to use up an appointment slot which might be more appropriate for another patient. I have used the e-consult service on 3 occasions - on one, a GP called me the next day, well within the 24 hour time frame that is mentioned, and offered me a face-to-face appointment for later that same day. On another occasion, I had an email response saying that a doctor would contact me for a phone consultation the following week (the reason I had made the e-consult enquiry was not urgent) and in the last instance, I received an email the day after my enquiry with the answer to my question which was related to my prescription."
Ivry,Treated like a proper individual,1/9/2017,5,When I went it was a very personal experience and I was treated like a proper individual
Ivry,Treated with respect and care,9/10/2019,5,"Excellent service
Always get an appointment when need one
Treated with respect and care"
Ivry,Very attentive to you,6/15/2022,5,"The staff here are lovely. They delivered the Covid jab very well.
We called up as needed a blood test and it was sorted very quick. They contacted me for that, so they are very proactive in keeping on top of things for you."
Ivry,Vigilant,6/15/2022,5,"The men's annual health check - I had bloods for that and within 4 days was contacted by them. I didn't have to chase them, which does make so much difference. They needed to raise a couple of things with me to speak to a GP and a telephone appointment was made for that which was totally appropriate and convenient."
Ixworth,1 Doctor is quite simply a fantastic GP,12/29/2022,5,"1 Doctor is one of the best Doctors we have ever met.   He is patient, open-minded, forward-looking and one of the most empathetic and supportive GPs you will ever meet.  One in a million!"
Ixworth,5 star,9/16/2015,5,5 star
Ixworth,A good surgery,3/10/2022,5,A good surgery in ongoing difficult circumstances. You may have to wait a little while to get an appointment but you just need to be a little patient. The care is good.
Ixworth,A great surgery,5/25/2022,4,I have no problems getting appointments and the care provided by staff is both friendly and caring.
Ixworth,A surgery that is a pleasure to visit!!!,6/29/2023,5,"Everyone knows it, Doctor's receptionists don't have great gatekeepers.  At Ixworth Surgery, the whole team goes against 'type' they are so lovely.  You really feel they want to help you, do the best they can for you, and go above and beyond to sort out your concerns.  Always met by a smile and not like you are an irritating distraction to their day.  I praise the team at Ixworth Surgery for making it a positive atmosphere even if your own health symptoms might be leaving you feeling a bit negative!"
Ixworth,All great,2/2/2023,5,Its all great at the surgery. I'm able to book appointmnets whenever I need them and you don't have to wait long for them either.  Staff are great and I've been impressed since moving to the surgery. Prescriptions are available when needed and it all runs smoothly.
Ixworth,All great,2/2/2023,5,"I've been able to get appointments easily and called this morning and I've been seen within an hour and a half. The staff are great and I  don't feel that anything needs to change, it all works well."
Ixworth,All works well,5/25/2022,5,"I called the surgery and spoke to reception staff who were friendly and helpful, they arranged an appointment for me and I had the appointment with in a week which has been great. I can't fault how its all worked for me."
Ixworth,Always really thorough,9/29/2022,5,"Anytime I go to the doctors whether its for me or my son they're always really thorough, listen to my concerns and take me seriously."
Ixworth,Always received an excellent service,9/5/2022,5,Reception team and clinicians alike always been friendly and helpful
Ixworth,Appointment availability,11/4/2022,4,"Cannot ring at 8am when emergency on the day appointments are released as I am at work by then, after that it is too late. Cannot sit in a phone queue also due to job role, so when I can ring a bit later all available appointments have gone. Working full time it is difficult to get appointments at a convenient time as they are always booked up. Cannot book to far ahead either, but I suppose that stops over booking by people on a just in case basis"
Ixworth,Appointments not easy to get but clinicians very good.,4/28/2017,4,This surgery is busy and keeps getting busier (or so it seems). Clinicians are all very good in my experience but appointments are not as easy to get as they used to be.
Ixworth,Been really good,5/25/2022,5,"A great surgery. For the kids you are instantly given appointments whenever they need to be seen, so much so that I barely got here in time last time. Care form the doctors and nurses is great."
Ixworth,Brilliant surgery,4/21/2017,5,"A brilliant surgery. Saw my GP, told her about how I felt and she ran some tests straight away, she then arranged for me to go straight up to the hospital to have further investigations and treatment. This was wonderful and very quick, really can't fault the surgery at all."
Ixworth,Busy first thing,2/2/2023,4,"It is busy first thing when calling but not particularly different to how it was before. Its a good surgery with pleasant staff, it works well and nothing needs to change really. I would like to see a specific GP if possible but its not really important."
Ixworth,Can't fault,2/2/2023,5,"You're not just a number at this surgery or with the staff. Reception staff, doctors and nurses are all wonderful and I've found the telephone consultations have worked really well. They are there to help whenever I need them."
Ixworth,Care for my husband was exemplary,4/28/2017,5,"When my husband was very ill the care provided for him was exemplary, nothing was too much trouble."
Ixworth,Care very good,3/10/2022,5,The care is very good but I haven't seen anyone for 3 years but have had chats on the phone and I'm confident if I needed to be seen after that I would be.  I have felt that at different points a face to face appointment would've been better and I've not had my annual reviews or medication reviews recently but I do like being able to talk to the pharmacist about medication issues.  One of my medications is still being prescribed even though the consultant has stopped it.  More recently when I got ill over the weekend I decided to call 111 rather than wait until monday as there is the worry that you won't get talk to or be seen on the day by a GP.
Ixworth,Confidence in staff,2/2/2023,4,"Its all good here with appointments easy to arrange on the whole, however, there have been times when I've been asked to call back the next day but thats been for non urgent issues. I have full confidence in the staff."
Ixworth,Diabetic nurse lovely,3/10/2022,4,"I feel there was a need to continue diabetic support throughout COVID, even if it was just a phone call but it all stopped. The diabetic nurse I've seen recently was lovely, really good support. Reception staff are always really nice and helpful. I've not needed a face to face appointment recently but before COVID they were always great."
Ixworth,Disappointed,6/12/2023,1,"We've had to wait three days to get children seen. We called on Friday but nothing was available, called again Monday, got through at 9am saw a pharmacist but was given nothing more than over the counter medication to help with our childs breathing. Also seen a nurse and been given a wrong diagnosis and I don't like that care navigators are deciding who you get to see."
Ixworth,Do feel there are barriers,5/25/2022,3,"I've found it difficult to get a face to face appointment even with the children and do feel that there are barriers at times and it's not easy but the care once you are in is great. My son struggles to articulate his feelings so we often need a face to face as it is difficult to know what the issues are but there is limited understanding of these additional difficulties.  I asked for a face to face appointment with a doctor a number of times over a couple of months but was told it wasn't necessary, finally I did get to see someone and was sent straight to A&E with a potentially life threatening issue."
Ixworth,Doctor's appointment,5/19/2023,5,"Excellent professional lady.
Gave me reassurance and good advice in a professional caring manner."
Ixworth,Easier to see any doctor than yours,6/13/2016,4,"I like having the same doctor. It's easier to see any doctor, if I wanted to see my doctor it could take two weeks."
Ixworth,Excellent,6/12/2023,5,"I've had no trouble getting appointments either telephone call backs or face to face appointments with a doctor. They do everything well and the staff are great, really can't fault."
Ixworth,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Very well organised  Covid clinic  Straight in & all done in about 5 minutes
Ixworth,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Very well organised Covid vaccination clinic. Straight in & all done in about 5 minutes.
Ixworth,Excellent & staff very helpful,10/16/2017,5,Including pharmacy. Very helpful friendly staff. Wife has several allergies but staff always work hard to order the brand of medication she can tolerate.
Ixworth,Excellent but hard to get appointments & staff can be unhelpful.,4/5/2017,5,It's difficult to get an appointment up to 2 weeks except for emergencies. Reception staff not always that helpful or understanding.
Ixworth,Excellent care and follow up,11/2/2023,5,I had excellent care both from the practice nurses and from a Dr when I had a severe toe infection which was then followed by a deep lung infection after having my flu jab.
Ixworth,Excellent surgery,8/29/2022,5,"Always prompt, courteous and efficient."
Ixworth,"Excellent surgery, easy to get appointments",4/21/2017,5,"Excellent surgery, very supportive and can get appointments when we need them. There are no problems with prescriptions and they are always ready for collection."
Ixworth,Exceptional kindness,12/17/2022,5,"During my multiple and lengthy, ongoing demands on the service, all members of the Practice have shown great kindness (as well as excellent clinical care) - from the Reception Team up to the GPs everyone has demonstrated their empathy through very kind and friendly contacts."
Ixworth,Fantastic,3/10/2022,5,"Fantastic surgery, really easy to get an appointment and are taken seriously when I speak to a GP. I'm really happy with the care provided. Having online appointments would be a great addition."
Ixworth,Felt understood,6/1/2023,5,I visited surgery for the first time. Saw a Doctor. Menopause issue which has left me feeling extremely anxious. She listened and gave further steps
Ixworth,Fine to get appointments,5/25/2022,4,"I generally see the GPs and it's been fine to get the appointments I need. I call the surgery to arrange appointments and it works well and the care is good.  The pharmacy is another thing, there is always an issue with prescriptions that need sorting out, getting prescriptions is slow too but I don't feel you can say anything."
Ixworth,Follow up to visit to West Suffolk Hospital,1/31/2023,5,A couple of days wait to get a non-urgent appointment. I was quite happy to see the Nurse Clinician who was knowledgeable and considerate - and prescribed the follow up medication I needed.
Ixworth,Found it difficult during covid,5/25/2022,3,Found it very difficult to get seen during covid and it meant that assumptions were made about a problem which then delayed diagnosis and treatment. Not everything can be diagnosed over the phone.
Ixworth,Getting better,2/2/2023,5,I feel that the surgery is better than it has been  but still not quite back to how it was. It is still a good surgery with lovely staff.
Ixworth,Good,2/2/2023,5,Appointments are quick to get and are avaialble after talking to reception staff.  I only had to wait an hour for an appointment this morning after I called first thing. They are great with children as they are seen very quickly. For non urgent issues you can either have a chat on the phone with a GP or can have an in person appointment.
Ixworth,Good access,2/2/2023,5,Access to appointments is good and so are home visits.  The staff have been lovely supporting us well at home in such a caring way.  I feel well supported as a carer and there is nothing that needs to change.
Ixworth,Good but would like to see a MS GP specialist and better foot care service.,8/14/2017,4,"I suppose I'm asking for the impossible but I wish one of the doctors would specialise in MS or pass on the latest findings and news that would possibly be of interest to me and other people with MS.
A more frequent podiatry service would be good. Foot care is important for everyone not just diabetics. More finance needed for chiropody training."
Ixworth,GP no empathy,10/5/2023,2,"Severe sore throat following Covid infection, 10 days of feeling unwell, sinusitis, cough and chest infection.  GP firing questions at me, not looking at recent notes from nurse, 111 and pharmacy.  I stood and cried.  I was prescribed Amoxicillin and now feeling much better, but didn't have a good GP experience, she was very sharp with the observations."
Ixworth,Great surgery,2/2/2023,5,"I'm able to get appointments when I need them and calling up to book appointments works well, with no long waits on the phone.  Staff are also very good."
Ixworth,Happy to see any of the staff,2/2/2023,4,"No problems getting to talk to or see a GP and I'm happy to see any of the staff team. The reception staff are helpful, polite, understanding and accomodating.  There has been a lack of baby vaccination clinics with a couple of cancelled appointments but this is possibly due to staff sickness.  I've used econsult and found I got quick responses on the day and that it worked well to address issues."
Ixworth,Happy with care and support,5/25/2022,4,"During covid I was seen very quickly when I was concerned about a lump. To see a specific GP it has meant a month wait to get the appointment. I was offered a phone call but decided that I'd rather have a face to face and was happy to wait. I'm happy with my GP, care and support I'm given.  The only issue is the lack of parking which can be a problem."
Ixworth,Happy with the surgery,5/25/2022,5,I tend to phone for appointments and have had a bit of a mix of triage and appointments booked by reception which have all been great. My daughter has been seen quickly for her asthma review and staff have been very supportive.
Ixworth,Highly recommend - we are very lucky,6/4/2023,5,"Appointments always available when needed. One GP is amazing, thorough, sympathetic and goes above and beyond. Reception staff are approachable and very helpful. We are very lucky to have a surgery like this"
Ixworth,Kept at arms length,3/10/2022,3,It feels like I'm being kept at arms length with not being able to easily get a face to face appointment and this is frustrating. You can't pre book a call back from the doctor which is very difficult with my work as I can not have my phone on me but the system in place doesn't allow a different way to access non urgent appointments.
Ixworth,Like having the pharmacy here,5/25/2022,5,"I like having the pharmacy at the surgery, it works really well and makes things easier.  I prefer to call than use online access and find this works well for getting appointments and I normally get to see the doctor I prefer too"
Ixworth,Medication review,6/12/2023,4,It's my first medication review since covid and I was sent the review form to complete. I've not had bloods taken for three years so I requested it be done but then had to go to the surgery to have my BP measured so I could put it on the form.  Overall a good surgery just different ways of doing things since covid.
Ixworth,Mixed,5/25/2022,4,I do find the appointment with the nurse difficult as I would prefer to see a GP face to face but this isn't offered. I've been in hospital but have had no follow up by the surgery. Overall the care is good I just don't like the way you have to access the surgery now.
Ixworth,One GP was extremely rude,6/15/2022,1,She was very rude to me and also at another time to a friend who uses the practice: he was in tears after seeing her because of her rude and dismissive attitude based on his advanced age. I left your surgery and moved to another one. On the other hand the staff in your pharmacy are well above average.
Ixworth,Phones are busy,3/10/2022,4,The phones are busy which is frustrating at times when you have to wait a long time. I tend to hang up and call back another time. Care is generally good once you are able to talk to someone. I also come up to the surgery as find it easier at times to book an appointment that way rather than calling.
Ixworth,Piece of cake to get appointments,2/2/2023,4,Its a piece of cake to get appointments. I've been well supported with my diabetes but during covid there was little or no support and it would've been nice to have some contact. During covid it was difficult to see a GP but then all the doctors got involved in the vaccination programme when they could've been seeing patients which I don't get. There are no issues with staff they listen and explain situations very well.
Ixworth,Poor - can never get an appointment,4/5/2017,2,I can never get an appointment.  It's very difficult
Ixworth,Poor - doctors don't listen,4/5/2017,2,Doctors don't listen.  They only want to tell me I am overweight.  We can't get past that to talk about my illnesses.  Very Poor
Ixworth,"Poor. Long waits for appointment, GP's don't listen, Pharmacy staff indiscreet.",8/14/2017,1,Can be expected to wait up to 5 weeks for an appointment.  Doctors do not listen to patient.  Appointment system and admin impossible/stressful.  Only good doctor has now left.  Do not feel pharmacy staff are discreet.  Receptionists ask why you want to see the doctor - isn't that confidential?
Ixworth,Praise where praise is due,3/10/2022,5,"Very nice surgery and make it an easy experience. I had an urgent situation and called them and was given an appointment quickly, it give me comfort to know that if urgent you do get seen. They are obviously busy but are doing their best and I'm really pleased to be with this surgery."
Ixworth,"Problems with Pharmacy, G.P. unwillingness",8/8/2022,1,"My Mum has been a patient at Ixworth Surgey since 1992.  Over the last year, she has developed more serious health problems she has been let down by this surgery and Pharmacy.  One G.P. told her there was no stronger pain relief than co-codamol.  Due to not being able to get a face to face appointment for over 5 weeks, she ended up being blue lighted to A&E when she finally got one.   Over a 4 month period, her monthly repeat prescription was never ready and when we waited for it to be ready there were still items missing."
Ixworth,Quick to get appointment,5/25/2022,4,"I phoned this morning and reception were able to give me an appointment straight away. I've not had to wait long so far but I'm not sure who I'll be seeing, that wasn't made clear."
Ixworth,Really good surgery,6/12/2023,5,Friendly and approachable staff and I've been very happy with the doctors I've seen and have brilliant diabetic care and support from the nurse. If you do want to see someone specific for something non urgent you may have to wait 2-3 weeks but they are available.
Ixworth,Regular visits at home,7/24/2017,5,Have regular visits from the nurses and this works very well.  They have been very consistent when they arrive which is really good.
Ixworth,They have forgotten it's about the patients.,5/19/2015,2,"Waited 20mins for reception to answer call on more than one occasion, Drs seem to rush you and their policy, ""One Patient One Problem"" has made me uncomfortable to mention something else which could be connected. Appointments hard to get unless you know you are going to be ill in 3weeks time. Dispensary are a law unto themselves very hit and miss."
Ixworth,Triage worked well,3/10/2022,5,"A good surgery and have a great relationship with my GP, they know me well. It can be difficult to get appointment, at times it has been a couple of weeks wait but then I do try to see the same GP if possible. They are very good at telephone consultations and the triage system has worked well and does prevent unnecessary visits to the surgery.  We're lucky we've got such a good surgery, it's great.  It's also quick to get prescriptions after appointments and I've spoken to the pharmacist about dleays getting some medications as I've nearly run out at times."
Ixworth,Unimpressed,9/16/2020,2,"I’ve had 2 phone consultations organising blood tests, one pre covid and one now.  In both of them I was talked over and they made assumptions instead of listening to me about what was needed and why.  In the first one I was nearly hung up on before the issue was even resolved.  Going privately now as I don’t want to be made to feel worse for something that’s already quite challenging, especially with a history of anxiety.

While I’ve been very unimpressed with the doctor/nurse I’ve encountered in these calls, I have to say that the reception staff and dispensers have always been super friendly and helpful and are honestly the only reason I’ve gone to them for anything. So thank you ladies!  Medication is dispensed quickly and reception have always gone above and beyond to help, even in these crazy times."
Ixworth,Very good,3/10/2022,5,"They are running a little behind today and I had to wait three weeks for this blood test but it has actually worked out well as the results are needed for a consultants appointment tomorrow. The care provided here is very good and I really can't fault it. It would be great if you were able to book appointments through the NHS app as it would help to be able to pick and choose the best time for an appointment rather than going through reception all the time. I've not been invited in for a well man clinic either, not sure if they are still being done?"
Ixworth,"Very helpful staff, excellent care given",2/3/2023,5,I felt I was taken seriously and follow up care has boosted my confidence in the support given
Ixworth,Very thorough and prompt,4/26/2022,5,"Ixworth has been my surgery for many years and I have always found the staff very accommodating, helpful and thorough. Recently I have been in touch with the surgery more than usual and, as always, I feel very satisfied with the care and attention I have received.  Thank you."
Ixworth,Was contacted by Ixworth to request a blood test,9/16/2022,3,Was contacted by Ixworth requesting I have a blood test at Stanton . Was unaware Stanton had closed so not sure how this misunderstanding occurred.
Ixworth,Wonderful and can't fault,3/10/2022,5,Phone up and get appointments very quickly and easily. I do try to see the one GP but I realise this is not always possible which is understandable. I have noticed that the phone can be ringing in reception but staff will be talking to each other about non work issues and you just think it would be nice if they just answered the phone.
Ixworth,Wonderful surgery,3/10/2022,5,"Able to make appointments easily and they are good with call backs as they come back to you quickly and then deal with the issues well too. Staff are very good, lovely and accommodating, friendly and helpful. They do everything that they need to they are a great surgery."
Kirkley,Abrupt receptionist,3/4/2019,4,I came in for my appointment and I was unsure what floor I would be on. I asked reception. She quite abruptly just pointed towards where the screens are and told me to check in there and that it would tell me on the screen. I felt she could have spoken more nicely to me than that.
Kirkley,Access can be difficult,11/13/2019,4,"Access to an appointment can be difficult from time - to -time.  Appointments 'always' run late, and a couple of time I have been on the wrong floor. When you check-in surely the screen or staff member could tell you what floor to be on."
Kirkley,All on time,1/12/2021,4,Annual blood test today and all is running on time. I hadn't needed the service much but it has been fine when I have needed it.
Kirkley,Always welcoming & reassuring,7/10/2015,5,I was very ill and I felt confident to call them there when I need to have my prescription if I cannot get in and so have it delivered to my home address (I have a very rare blood group so my medication is very important). They always answer my phone calls even when they are very busy. They have developed more therapy services which I may find useful as I age. they are so approachable and that to me is an important skill.
Kirkley,Appalling out of date website,8/15/2022,1,Trying to book an appointment online using the tool. It’s 15 August and the process throws up a message saying surgery will be closed 14-19 April and the form will be available from 8am 19 April. It’s 7:30 Monday 15 August and that message is still on there and not allowing a request for an appointment to be made.
Kirkley,Appointments!,5/12/2017,2,Can't get an appointment so have ended up going to A&E twice now in last 6 months.
Kirkley,Better than previous surgery,11/13/2019,4,"Things are better here than my previous surgery.  They need some music playing though, as it feels 'silly quiet' and you can hear everything that is being said between patients and reception, wherever you are."
Kirkley,Brilliant from start to finish,8/11/2022,5,One person is amazing such and such a lovely lady who has looked after my little girl so well every time. I couldn't ask for anyone better. Really appreciate all that she does.
Kirkley,Came in to do the triage,11/3/2020,3,"Now they’ve got the online triage, I tried phoning but couldn’t get through so had to come in with two little ones and go through it. They’ve booked us in for later. Managed to pick up another prescription at same time."
Kirkley,Cannot get appointment before my holiday,5/12/2017,3,"Walked in today to get an appointment as I can never get on on the day over the telephone. I had tried to book in advance last week and was told they were all gone for the next 3 weeks. Today I am am told there is nothing for the next 2 weeks and I need to see a GP before then as I am going on holiday for some time. Its a nightmare!
Staff do not seem like they care, they are very blase' and do not understand the urgency of my situation."
Kirkley,Changed a fair bit,11/13/2019,3,This service has changed a fair bit.  No longer get a 'dedicated' GP.
Kirkley,Confusing appointment changes,6/10/2016,3,I am under Kirkley Mill for various things and when I call to change an appointment I then have to call Northgate. I have trouble with the call centres and they do not understand me.
Kirkley,Convenient,10/1/2019,4,"As I need a couple of services that run out of here, I find the premises very convenient.  There seems to be a couple of regular GP's now, but it has taken a long time to sort that out.  Parking can be difficult at times.  They generally run late 10-20 mins, which can be difficult if I have other things to do."
Kirkley,Convenient for blood tests,10/29/2018,4,It is very convenient to get blood test locally instead of going to the Lowestoft Hospital.  We much prefer it.  Parking can be difficult though.
Kirkley,Cut off on the phone,1/12/2021,3,I had difficulty getting through on the telephone. Twice I waiting in the queue and just got cut off. My daughter put in the 'online' form on my behalf and I got a call for the appointment today. I don't want to rely on my child all the time who does not live with me. Also when I was 8th in the queue on the telephone it stayed like that before I was cut off after 30 minutes.
Kirkley,Difficult move from Wentworth,5/22/2017,3,As a patient that was at Wentworth surgery I find the whole process of moving into Kirkley very backhanded.  All along it was their plan to close Wentworth and merge it but they told us they are not going to do that.  Yet that is what's happened.  It's not easy to get to either
Kirkley,Difficult to get an appointment,9/22/2016,2,"Came from Germany 2014.  Seen 11 different doctors at Kirkley Mill.  Almost a year ago called at 8 am and constantly tried for 40 minutes.  They said there were no appointments.  Needed a prescription for foot cream.
Only see locums.  One reduced me to tears"
Kirkley,Do not get consistency,3/17/2016,2,"The trouble with surgery, is there are too many locums. I never get to see the same person twice. It just does not help when you have a few conditions. You have to repeat yourself so often as they do not have time to read your history."
Kirkley,Doing well considering,10/11/2017,4,"This surgery I believe is doing well, considering how stretched they are. We don't see a regular GP, but that is becoming the norm. the pharmacy really helps us too and prevents us feeling we need to see the GP sometimes"
Kirkley,Easy to access,6/16/2023,4,"I use a mix of online and telephoning in, depending on my schedule. 
I have always found it easy to access the service. Today I am in for my blood test which was done in advance and have no issues."
Kirkley,Excellent,11/24/2016,5,"Very good surgery, very helpful"
Kirkley,Excellent,11/24/2016,5,Have not been there long but so far all good
Kirkley,Excellent care and support,7/28/2021,5,I visited with my mother-in- law. They were supportive and really listened to our concerns. She immediately booked us in to ambulatory care at the James Paget. Here they carried out thorough testing and we got a diagnosis. We will forever be grateful to their quick response. Thank you
Kirkley,Excellent for me,6/16/2023,5,"I have always found this surgery excellent for me. I use online mainly as it works very well. You get a response very quickly, but always the same day and it just works well. when online is pushed to use (which it is not here, but I do prefer it), when it works well like this, it encourages you to continue using it and means those that cannot use online get more access via the telephone."
Kirkley,Excellent online system,6/16/2023,5,I use the online system and it is excellent for me so I do use it all the time. I tend to get a response within 10-15 mins which in all honesty I could have been waiting that long on the telephone if I tried to ring in. I have not had any issues here in the 3 years that I have been here.
Kirkley,Excellent surgery,11/24/2016,5,I think the service has improved when you phone for an appointment.  I like it that you know where you are in the queue and that you wil soon be able to speak to someone.  Excellent surgery
Kirkley,Excellent surgey,11/24/2016,5,Excellent surgery but own GP is away at other surgery  as locum and one day emergency only so not always able to see him.  Appointments ok.  Same day but GP always busy so long wait once you get there.
Kirkley,Fair,11/20/2017,5,Fair
Kirkley,"Fantastic, Professional.",6/6/2018,5,"Been waiting to be seen at hospital since 15th jan. Staff at Kirkley Mill Surgery went to see pharmacist, rang hospital. rang me back the next day, no responce from hospital. They chased the hospital and i got an appointment 3 days later. thank you for your time, nothing was to much trouble."
Kirkley,Feel I'm in very safe hands,9/18/2020,5,"All staff listen, take concerns seriously, fit me in at surgery or call back same day. Prescription ordering system is excellent"
Kirkley,Feel listened to,10/29/2018,5,"I do feel listened to by my GP.  Reception team have a lot of time for you too, if explanations are needed"
Kirkley,Feels like a morgue,10/1/2019,3,"The premises is lovely and new, but it is so quiet and the atmosphere is like a morgue. May be some background music would help."
Kirkley,Foot still not right. Podiatary service.,4/25/2016,3,"They had to take my nail off, but it does not feel right. I have had a course of anti-biotics but it still does not feel right. It is not healing as it should. I had to redress it myself and it was not easy as I am squeamish."
Kirkley,Form filling was frustrating,1/12/2021,3,"Rang the surgery when my child's tonsils were bleeding. I was told to fill in the form online. I asked for urgent appointment but they said they cannot give me anything without the form being filled in. Reception id fill it in and I was given a call to say it would be dealt with tomorrow. I then called 111 who got me out of hours appointment at the same venue. I even saw the same doctor who rang me back!  This was a highly stressful and frustrating situation. It ended up ok. No one suggested that I call 111, I luckily knew to do this, as I felt it could not wait another day and certainly did not want to go to A&E."
Kirkley,Generally good,10/11/2016,4,no waiting. Could have longer appointments.  Very good at explaining why and wherefore.  Pity they are so booked up.  Only 1 appointment every 6 weeks
Kirkley,Good care overall,6/6/2016,4,"There has been an increase in patients attending this surgery since the closure of another practice. I have noticed that it is more difficult to get an appointment since that happened.
The care I get though it mainly good. I find the premises pleasant but a bit stark."
Kirkley,Good choice given,6/16/2023,4,Always use the online system and it gives you the choice of getting a call/text/email. I prefer a message as I am not good on the telephone and they always meet that request. Todays appointment was booked ahead of time as a routine appointment.
Kirkley,Good communication,3/4/2019,5,Have blood tests regularly and in 2 days my medication is adjusted accordingly. Good communication between each service and with me. It is very convenient to come into the surgery rather than have to go to the hospital.
Kirkley,Good co-ordination,3/4/2019,4,"They co-ordinate my appointment well. I get text reminders which is very good. As I get anxious, putting my two appointments only 15-20 minutes apart is very thoughtful."
Kirkley,Good most the time,10/11/2017,4,"I find the surgery good most of the time that I have used it. I can walk there easily as it is very local to me, which I am grateful for."
Kirkley,good problem with waiting,6/14/2016,4,Waiting times too long
Kirkley,Got better lately,10/29/2018,4,Things have been getting better with communication about medication and the link to monthly blood tests.  It was an on going issue and took more than 6 month to resolve
Kirkley,Got better more recently,11/13/2019,4,Have seen things get better more recently.  Still gets confusing about what floor you need to be on.  I came upstairs and the clinician came up to get me.
Kirkley,Got me in quickly,1/12/2021,5,They got me in really quickly for my bloods. Not really needed the service up until now but worked well for my needs today. They are ensuring they do thorough tests to try to get to bottom of my issue.
Kirkley,Great,5/28/2020,5,Always quick to respond online. Always go out their way to either fit me in at surgery or do a voice call and prescriptions are sent straight away to the chemist for pick up
Kirkley,Had to walk in,11/13/2019,3,"I rang in many times today and could not get through, so have ended up walking in and need now to make a separate appointment for a later date."
Kirkley,Hard to get an appointment,11/24/2016,2,It is difficult to get an appointment
Kirkley,Haven't seen GP in a while,11/13/2019,4,"Do not use surgery often, but it changes every time I come in.  Haven't seen a GP for a while now, but Nurses are lovely.  Receptionists vary."
Kirkley,Helped when I walked in,1/12/2021,4,I walked in to the service in the morning as I have been sent some new patches for a heart monitor and I have no way of being able to change them myself. They were really good at seeing me and dealing with it even though I had no appointment.
Kirkley,Helpful,11/13/2019,4,"I find the surgery staff very friendly and helpful.  I do not use it that much, but works for me when I do"
Kirkley,Helpful reception,2/5/2019,4,Access is less good than used to be. Find reception helpful and it is good to come local for blood test when need them.
Kirkley,Hope it improves,10/1/2019,3,"For a long time this surgery has not met expectation. It is a lovely building and all sounded wonderful before opening, but so far it does not deliver on a standard that I would expect that matches what is proposed when it was all planned.
Reception are better than they were, but getting continuity is non existent, and I thought that was what was going to be better with more services under one roof.  Car parking does not cater for the demand on the amount of services they run here.
There is no out of hours out of here, as was advertised."
Kirkley,horrendous disorganized locum fest,1/29/2018,1,simply terrible service from admin to surgical. no chance of a family doctor here as it is just locum stand ins whos first language is not English.
Kirkley,I find staff a bit rude,5/12/2017,4,The Car park is not safe for walking though if you park down the side. They need to somehow add a pavement in as you have to walk in the road which is narrow.
Kirkley,Improving lately,10/1/2019,4,"I have seen the change here in how you are treated.  Having a regular GP was an issue, but I get to see familiar faces more now.  Reception team are kind and welcoming, which is what you need when you feel unwell.
Convenient that I can get my blood tests done close to GP appointments when I need to."
Kirkley,Kept up with our checks,1/12/2021,5,"We have across the family had a few appointments over the last few months. The regular checks we have continued as normal and we have found the service to be excellent, with every thing else that has gone, we as patients have not been forgotten."
Kirkley,Kind and caring staff,3/4/2019,5,"Access to appointments really good. Have kind and caring staff, right from GPs to nurses and nurse practitioners."
Kirkley,Kind and we'll mannered,7/2/2020,5,Nice staff
Kirkley,Kind staff,2/5/2019,4,"Here for blood test, appointment made easily and regularly. Staff kind on all fronts."
Kirkley,Local and convenient,10/1/2019,4,"Since moving this way, I am pleased that I can walk to this surgery, and get a good service from the clinical staff. Reception is lovely too.  I had a bit of Physio here too, and that was convenient.  It just feels more joined up with your care."
Kirkley,Long wait on phone to book appointment,3/4/2019,3,"Manage to get appointment 'on the day' once you get through, which can take about half an hour."
Kirkley,Long wait on the phone for an appointment,2/5/2019,3,"Waited a while to get this. Getting through on phone took a while today. I was verging on ringing 111, I was getting that fed up."
Kirkley,Longer and longer waits,6/10/2016,3,You have to wait longer and longer each time for treatment and given no ideas as to when an appointment will come. Calling each day just gets stressful
Kirkley,"Massive surgery, clean and quiet",2/5/2019,4,"Moved into area a year ago. Things seem pretty good. Surgery is massive, clean and actually feels very quiet. With such a high population, this strikes me as unusual."
Kirkley,Message confusing,6/16/2023,4,"I rang twice at 8am and the message was saying that they were closed until Monday, which is strange for a Friday morning. I did wonder if I had called too early, but that would have meant the message was saying that from when they closed on Thursday. As I was concerned I called 111 who managed to get the appointment within 30 minutes of me making contact. I was pleased that this was resolved quickly and that I got an appointment. I had just hung up thinking there was a problem at the practice."
Kirkley,Never any issues,1/12/2021,5,"I have never had any issues here.  Reception are always polite to me when I ring in and when I have come in. Being younger I think that's great as I feel respected, but I also give respect. I cannot use online services though, and I do not feel I am penalised because of that, which is great."
Kirkley,Nice new building but...,5/12/2017,3,The building is lovely and new. the staff do not seem like they want to help you. It is hard to get an appointment but no one tells you why.
Kirkley,No complaints,11/13/2019,5,I have nothing to complain about as I have been able to access appointment when needed.  Staff alway kind and clinical staff are caring.
Kirkley,No dedicated Doctor,11/13/2019,3,No 'dedicated' Doctor now.  But each GP I see has been very good.  I do worry something could be missed due to no continuity
Kirkley,No dedicated GP,11/13/2019,3,"I have no dedicated GP, and so you never see the same person twice, so this worries me as I have ongoing conditions and they could miss something as they never know your history."
Kirkley,Not clear who an appointment is with,3/4/2019,3,I rang and it took ages to get through. I came in thinking I was seeing a GP and when I checked in it is a nurse practitioner. This is fine but I'd prefer to know before then.
Kirkley,"Not consistent, no confidence",2/5/2019,3,"Not consistent. GPs change. No confidence because of this. Feel you start from scratch when you see the GP. Get palmed off on a nurse too, which is OK, but cannot always deal with what I am there for."
Kirkley,Not much to fault,5/12/2017,5,I use this surgery rarely but when I do it fits my needs.
Kirkley,Nurses Excellent,11/13/2019,5,"Although I do not see many GP's, the Nurses are excellent and deal with what I need at the time."
Kirkley,Poor,2/3/2017,1,"I get fed up never seeing the same doctor.  I have ongoing COPP conditions among other things.  I used to be give medication that helped my condition, but as I am not  on death's door they refuse to give me it again.Apparently I have almost to die to get it again"
Kirkley,Poor,9/30/2019,2,Found myself waiting over 1 hour to be seen.  Long time if at work.  Not happy
Kirkley,Poor appointment system,11/24/2016,2,I attend James Paget Hospital every  weeks for review of of treatment but keep getting appointments through with the nurse.  Seems a waste of money and time
Kirkley,Poor impression,3/30/2022,1,"Spoke to member of staff regarding my elderly mum.
Person was patronising , unhelpful and gave me the impression that she really didn’t care about my mum. Very sad."
Kirkley,Poor new appointment system,3/4/2019,3,"Don't like the new appointment system, it taken much longer to get through on telephone. Last time was 35 minutes, and today was 25 minutes. Whilst I am on hold I am being charged. When I got through last time and was told to ring back at 1pm. So it took all of my day to get an appointment."
Kirkley,"Poor. Cannot get a walk-in appointment, GP doesn't listen and won't change medication.",8/14/2017,3,"When I get an appointment they do not run on time.  I often do not have credit on my mobile so cannot always call at 8 am, so I walk in. But they say I have to go home and phone them.  GP does not listen to me about my medication.  My painkillers give me horrible side effects but they won't change them as they seem to think I am an addict when I have no addictions."
Kirkley,Reception goes out of way to help,10/29/2018,5,"Partner in today and we both have separate appointments,  mine is this afternoon.  When we checked in for my partners appointment this morning, reception offered to ask if my appointment can be changed so that I did not need to make two trips that day.  Thankfully there were able to see me.  I had not even asked, the receptionist did that completely of her own back.
I felt that was really kind, and an example of how they do go out their way here to be helpful."
Kirkley,Receptionist very helpful,11/24/2016,5,"The receptionist was very helpful with appointments for Beccles Hospital and JPH Goreston, with blood test, flu jabs, shingles etc"
Kirkley,Responded very quickly to give the necessary,12/3/2021,5,They have understood my needs and concern and always responded quickly.
Kirkley,"Should be closed! Too many locum GP's, staff attitude poor and very hard to get appointments",7/9/2017,1,"I have only ever seen one kind caring Dr here, the rest are locums earning big bucks for doing a poor job, no continuity of care and appointments as rare as hens teeth! Yet bugger all patients in waiting room whenever I go there, reception staff chatter about their personal lives whilst drinking coffee! Or they just march back and forth through waiting area!! APPALLING place"
Kirkley,Son discharged but no explanation provided,3/5/2018,1,"My son has been discharged from the service with no explanation why he no longer meets the criteria. He has accessed this service for over ten years. As I am not a podiatrist, I cannot do his feet and he hasn't the motor skills or mental capacity to do so! But the service couldn't even give me a recommendation of a known person / podiatrist who would be able to carry out a similar service. Not good. I feel this is one of the only things I can't do for my son but I can't get a scalpel out and cut his feet about!!! Disgusting - my son has down syndrome, congenital heart disease and psoriasis, under-active thyroid gland and severe learning difficulties."
Kirkley,System change,10/1/2019,4,"I am aware that this surgery will be going over to 'On the day' only appointments soon.  My old surgery did this, but then stopped it, so I couldn't have worked.  I do not use the service very much, but when I do, I hope I will be able to access it ok."
Kirkley,The signage is in a silly place,3/17/2016,3,"When you visit this surgery, you sit facing the doors with the signage behind you, or round the corner. It is a little bit silly. Considering it is new, I would have thought they would have got this right."
Kirkley,Transport to surgery now difficult,5/22/2017,4,Moved to this surgery  but due to transport issues it is very difficult to get to.  Last bus back to Oulton Broad is 2.30 pm
Kirkley,Trying again today with child,1/12/2021,4,The surgery are seeing my child again today for bloods after previously unable to get them. The made the appointment at the time and gave us good advice to try help this time. They are very patient.
Kirkley,Upstairs reception is good,11/13/2019,4,"Having a reception upstairs is better, but I came up and then discovered my appointment was downstairs!"
Kirkley,Very good in general,1/12/2021,5,"This is a very good surgery in general, though I have no idea who my GP is as I see a number of different people. Receiving a dressing change today after my recent operation at James Paget."
Kirkley,Very good service,10/1/2019,5,"Even when this place was less 'settled' I never really had any issues.  I am happy with the treatment I get, and it does not bother me who I see as I trust they are the professional.  As long as they know a bit of my history so I do not have to explain every time,   I am happy to see anyone.  So far so good.  It can run behind at appointments, which would be my only slight criticism."
Kirkley,Very helpful staff,3/4/2019,4,"Very helpful staff. Phoned for GP appointment this morning, got straight through and was given an appointment at 9.45am but still waiting at 10.10am. Running quite late isn't so good."
Kirkley,Very responsive,6/16/2023,5,"Truly outstanding help for us today. They were extremely responsive to my urgent need for medication due to a distressing situation I woke up to this morning. They did not turn me away, as I had no appointment but the Receptionist was amazing, putting a request through to my GP who knows me well and has previously prescribed this. I was so grateful and cannot thank them enough."
Kirkley,Waited 40 mins and then told no appointments,8/17/2016,2,Came from Germany Nov 2014. Seen 11 different doctors at Kirkley mill. About a month ago you called at 8am & constantly tried for 40 mins & they said there is no appointments. Needed a prescription for foot cream. Only see Locums. Have been reduced to tears.
Kirkley,Waiting at appointments,11/13/2019,4,"People with booked appointments, should only have to wait for up to 20 minutes as sometimes can be waiting between 30 to 60 minutes"
Kirkley,website does not work,3/13/2023,1,"When I tried to register, message ' we are fully booked today' comes up.  When I tried to book a routine appointment, same message. When I tried to contact the Surgery via the 'message' button, I received the same message.

This is meant to be an online service.  It doesn't seem to work.

I am trying to set my parents up with online access to their surgery to make it easier for them to book an appointment.  

Please can you advise on how I might achieve this?"
Kirkley,Works for me,11/13/2019,4,"When I need to see someone, I do.  With no major conditions, things work fine for me.  Older members of my family find it more difficult though."
Kirkley,Works for me,2/5/2019,4,"Do not have much experience of using this surgery, but it has worked for me so far. Got appointment today."
Leiston,6 monthly check with my own GP,8/23/2018,4,"There is a new appointment system here. I called this morning to get to see my GP as I called a month ago to make the 6 monthly check up appointment that my GP likes me to see them for, and was told I now had to call on the day. When I did call this morning I was then told I may not get to see my GP and would have to wait for a call back. I got a bit angry but later another receptionist called me back and I apologised. I know they are just doing their job. I was told I could see my GP and was given an appointment. My GP explained the system in more detail and so now I understand more fully. The GP assured me I can speak to them and just need to ask for the call back from them direct from them and the reception team should be able to accommodate that. We were given a leaflet about it, but I feel that did not explain it as well as the GP did. I would have been more understanding if it had been explained better in the first place."
Leiston,A nice little surgery,3/4/2019,4,"It's a nice little surgery, although you can't talk much with the reception if you had something confidential. You can hear everything patients and staff say."
Leiston,A really excellent service.,11/3/2016,5,A really excellent service.
Leiston,Able to coincide appointments,8/22/2018,4,"Today I was able to coincide my blood test appointment with my partners appointment which was extremely helpful. They are, in my experience a very good surgery."
Leiston,Ages to see a GP,7/7/2023,3,"It is really good once you see them, but it took ages to see a GP. It was 2 months to get the GP appointment, which was on the hospital's recommendation. The hospital had to end up writing to the surgery for me to get an appointment."
Leiston,Appointment in reasonable time,12/14/2018,4,I find that I can get an appointment in a reasonable time and my GP refers me when appropriate to other services.
Leiston,Appointment system OK but could be better,5/16/2019,5,"Appointment/triage system works OK, but means that you do not see anyone until about 9.30-10am I feel that the first hour of surgery time could be booked the previous day if you call in."
Leiston,Brilliant medical staff,2/15/2022,4,"Drs, nurses, HCAs are all amazing. Very thorough, very friendly, just excellent all round. The reception staff are not quite up to this standard unfortunately-  entitled (ignored for 5 minutes when stood at reception when there were at least 3 reception staff), and very patronising  bordering on rude."
Leiston,"Brilliant, innovative, great appointments",4/19/2020,5,"Phone and be triaged, then phoned back by GP or other relevant staff, appointment the same day if necessary, often not, dealt with on phone. Great system, reduced 'no shows' tremendously allowing GPs to spend their time treating people. Referrals good, chased when necessary. Can't praise everyone enough."
Leiston,Communication,12/10/2022,4,"Communication could be better between them and the hospital. I was to sent to the hospital just to have a covid test (6 '22) before then having further investigations. Felt I could have done the test at the surgery. It is a 25 mile trip to the hospital. I was not even staying in, so it made no sense to me anyway!"
Leiston,Confident in them,12/10/2022,4,Have had good access for my blood tests that are linked to the hospital who 'keep an eye' on me in relation to prostate. I am very confident in them because of this.
Leiston,Confidentiality at reception,8/22/2018,3,"It feels like you are hearing everything at reception, when they talk on the telephone and taking patients details. I have heard a name and telephone number read out by them in the past. This is concerning."
Leiston,Consistency of treatment not good,5/16/2019,4,Things are running a bit behind today. I find that as I do not see the same person there is not the consistency of treatment I would like.
Leiston,Do not have dedicated GP,8/22/2018,3,"I do not feel as connected to the surgery now. I am unsure where I am as I have recently heard that my GP is leaving, so I have no idea who I am assigned to anymore. I would like to be kept better informed."
Leiston,Efficient,10/12/2018,5,I find that the new call back system is very efficient
Leiston,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"This has been excellent since being here now for a few months. I moved from another surgery that I felt I was being fobbed off and having cancer, that was unacceptable. I have found this surgery amazing."
Leiston,Excellent,12/10/2022,5,"This is an excellent service for me. I find transport very difficult as I rely on a neighbour, and this is unfair. I would like to be able to book appointment more in advance so I can book community transport rather than putting on my neighbour."
Leiston,Excellent,8/26/2021,5,Helpful. Polite  and efficient.
Leiston,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,I have nothing to add.  It  is a great surgery better than some I hear of
Leiston,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,"Really good.  They always look out for us.  When I could not get an appointment on the day, I got a call midmorning saying they had a cancellation"
Leiston,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,A recent patient.  Not had any issues
Leiston,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,My GP has been magnificent as have other doctors.  Keep it up!
Leiston,Excellent,4/24/2017,5,Depends on how well it is managed  - need to work together
Leiston,Excellent,4/24/2017,5,Overall a very good service that I do not use often
Leiston,Excellent,4/24/2017,5,"Good service overall.  Appointments can run behind a bit, but I've learnt to expect that"
Leiston,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Some staff make you feel tolerated rather than welcomed. - almost aggressive.  ""You're disturbing my reading"" attitude.  Getting an apt is ok as long as I didn't mind which dr. I see -  I didn't."
Leiston,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Excellent doctors here
Leiston,Excellent,3/16/2016,5,very pleased with this practice
Leiston,Excellent - always get an appointment,4/24/2017,5,Always get an appointment when need one.  I do not see my own GP all the time but I am fine with that
Leiston,Excellent - staff always lovely.,4/18/2017,5,Staff always lovely.  They tend to run on time but I have waited up to an hour in the past.  A split seat needs to be repaired.
Leiston,Excellent and caring.,4/18/2017,5,This is a nice surgery with a nice local caring feel about it.  Change is always difficult so I hope we keep the community spirit going throughout the changes.
Leiston,Excellent but communication could be better. Could be told of delays in seeing GP's.,4/18/2017,5,Communication could be better  If there are delays to seeing doctor for an appointment already booked.  Suggest a white board or display as used at A & E.
Leiston,"Excellent, can get appointment to see my own GP",4/24/2017,5,Happy with service.  I always get an appointment when I need one and I see my own GP most of the time.
Leiston,Excellent. Usually get appointment when wanted but waiting times can be long.,4/18/2017,5,"When I need an appointment, most of the time I get one on the day.  You very often have to wait though, but I understand that the GP likes to give patients more than the 10mminutes"
Leiston,Fabulous practice that actually listens!,3/18/2021,5,Having been at another local practice for 14 years and feeling on the odd occasion I had need to call them that I was nothing but a nucience. NHS 111 suggested I move practice after a medical emergency. Leiston surgery were recommended by friends and they are fabulous. They listen and make you feel like you matter which is a breath of fresh air. Thank you too all the Team.
Leiston,Fair,2/3/2017,3,As a teenager  I found it really easy to make an appointment and the staff made it easy
Leiston,fair,6/21/2016,3,"I have found the staff to be really rude and quite heartless.  The waiting time to actually see a dr is between 3 - 5 weeks.
We are expected to tell the receptionist our personal problems to see a dr. sooner"
Leiston,Fair - takes too long to see a GP,4/24/2017,3,Takes too long to see a GP
Leiston,Fair but long waiting times.,4/18/2017,3,Waiting times for appointments could be a lot better.  Waiting to go into appointments after you get one is terrible.  We have waited over 1 hour to be seen
Leiston,Get things on time,7/7/2023,5,"Regular bloods are taken linked to my cancer treatment in hospital. Never have I had any issues with this. They get me in on time as they have to wait for me to be in hospital to then make the next appointment, rather than being able to book in advance with that  person. It is all done in a timely manner and I have had no incidences of not getting it done or having to go elsewhere."
Leiston,Good,8/31/2017,4,In the main this surgery is good.  Reception staff are lovely and always try to help if I need it.  My GP is very good.  Think this tends to mean appointments run late as they try to give each patient good care
Leiston,Good,8/31/2017,4,"when you see someone they are excellent.  Getting 2on the day"" appointments is near impossible but they have a ""sit and wait"" system.  When we last did that we did not have to wait too long."
Leiston,Good,8/31/2017,4,"difficult to get an appointment on the day but I will get a phone call, which is good for me"
Leiston,Good,8/31/2017,4,"Have found this surgery brilliant.  We moved up here from Essex and have much better care her.  GP's are lovely.
Is Saxmundham going to join?  They need to as under so much pressure and it looks like it will benefit all involved"
Leiston,Good,4/24/2017,4,Only been with surgery for one year and I find all is very good
Leiston,Good,4/24/2017,4,Regular use.  Good overall experience
Leiston,Good,4/18/2017,4,I do not come to the surgery much but managed to get an appointment today at short notice
Leiston,good,7/3/2019,4,Doctors and nurses are friendly and my key worker will explain everything to me when I get home.  I have repeat prescription which is always delivered on time
Leiston,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Emergency appointments are easy to get, prescription service is very good and are always ready on time"
Leiston,Good access,3/4/2019,5,Very convenient to come here. I pick up prescriptions here within two days which is excellent.
Leiston,Good but need a drinks machine,4/24/2017,4,Could do with a coffee/tea machine
Leiston,Good but staff attitude varies.,4/18/2017,4,Some staff can be very helpful and some can be a bi short with you.  I have had some rudeness.
Leiston,Good but waiting times can be long,4/24/2017,4,Surgery runs a bit behind sometimes but never more than 20 minutes
Leiston,"Good care, but....",12/10/2022,3,"We have had good care, but lately we have found one particular receptionist being quite rude and pushy about how much information we need to give on the telephone. Something recently was extremely personal and  she kept saying 'the doctor needs more information than that!' As I say, care is good, but cannot see a specific doctor when you ask and this is an ongoing worry, as seeing the same person would be more beneficial all round."
Leiston,Good overall,12/10/2022,4,"A good surgery overall where you get down quite quickly in the phone queue. One improvement would be to have a positioned mirror, so you could see if cars were coming up/down the slope.
We have had occasional issues with the lift not working too and that was a major problem with getting up the stairs."
Leiston,Good surgery,6/1/2017,5,This is a good surgery-I use online booking and I am finding that it is very good.
Leiston,Good to have a local offer,3/4/2019,5,I have always been treated very well. Good to have a local offer.
Leiston,"Good. Receptionist better,",4/18/2017,4,Better receptionist than before.  She used to try and triage me and I really didn't like that.  Much better now
Leiston,GP keeps me in the loop,8/22/2018,5,Overall an excellent surgery. With multiple medical conditions I find the GP very good at keeping me in the loop and referring to hospital/blood tests/physio
Leiston,Great when I see the GP of choice,8/22/2018,5,"Everything here is good as long as I see one of two GP's. I refuse to see one that did not diagnose or refer me when I knew I was not right. I had cancer, but found out almost a year later when I demanded for a second opinion at the surgery. My ratings are based on my experience now not the past."
Leiston,Hard to see who you want,7/12/2023,4,"I do not mind that you get a call initially sometimes, but that seems to be where things stop as there is no follow up and it is hard to see someone you want and that would help with feeling they have been thorough."
Leiston,Holiday appointment,9/30/2021,5,"I called the surgery this morning as we are on holiday in the area and I wasn't feeling very well. The lovely receptionist asked me to come in and give a urine sample, when I got there both members of staff I spoke to were very friendly and helpful and explained a nurse would phone me later with the results, which they did and asked me to call in for a prescription as I had a UTI. What wonderful service, thank you"
Leiston,Just do not care,12/12/2018,2,"I have found that staff are ok, and I can get an appointment, but when I feel rushed so no time to explain things properly, and I do not like the call back as I feel that you cannot be assessed properly over the phone.  I have always ended up needing to come in as I only ring when I know I am needing a GP.  It is frustrating."
Leiston,Just registered here,10/12/2018,5,"We moved into the area, and so this is my first appointment.  So far all good, as I was able to access easily today, but to see a nurse, not a GP.
I find the system long winded, but understand why they are doing it.  I just had not come across a system like that before."
Leiston,Kind to me,12/10/2022,5,Really helpful to me as I am quite a nervous person and need support to do certain things. They are kind and take their time with me.
Leiston,Lift working!,7/7/2023,3,"Good to see the lift working, it is an ongoing issue and you do not know until you come into the door if you park downstairs, with the intention to get the lift, or upstairs and your appointment may be downstairs. It can get difficult."
Leiston,My overview on things,10/12/2018,4,"- Unsure about the 'ring back' same day system - impossible to accommodate during the work day, therefore requires taking a whole day off: makes sens for illness but not for more routine appointments.
- Policy of limiting long-term prescriptions to monthly batches; increases cost + very inconvenient. I stopped taking the antihistamine because consistent gap between my monthly pills being available to be picked up."
Leiston,Need them to support me,9/10/2019,3,I could do with more support from them to chase Ipswich Hospital. I do not like to keep bothering them but nowhere else to turn too.
Leiston,New appointment system has improved access,5/16/2019,4,"Since changing the appointment system I feel the service has actually got better. You get an appointment after a phone call from a GP, but sometimes a chat with them doesn't mean you need to come in, and I find that good."
Leiston,New patient,12/10/2022,4,I have received an excellent service since moving here last year from another surgery. This surgery has provided better response to my concerns and under a certain hospital receiving excellent care now.
Leiston,No chasing needed,12/10/2022,5,"Never had an issue for myself. I don't come very often, but when I need it, it works well. In for a review today which they booked in advance by contacting me. I did not need to chase it, which is good as they are 'on top of things."
Leiston,No complaints,5/16/2019,5,"No complaints here, system works well for me and my family. Learnt to live with not seeing the same GP."
Leiston,No issues,12/10/2022,5,Never had any issues here since being here for 3 years. I always call in and get through fine and they contact me when I need bloods like today.
Leiston,Not a number,12/12/2018,5,The surgery has always been a good standard.  You care treated as a person and not just a number.  Getting an appointment is much easier since we had the new system start.
Leiston,Ok for us,7/12/2023,5,"My family and I have not had any issues. It has been ok for us. We do not need anything regularly and we do not have ongoing conditions, so rarely here. It works when we need it. I have seen various clinicians except a GP, but would hope I would get one if the situation called for it."
Leiston,"Once you get through, good",7/12/2023,4,"The people you see are good, once you actually get through the system. With less than average needs for an appointment, it can be frustrating that when you absolutely need to see someone, it is a bit of feeling that you have to jump though hoops. I do not mind who I see if they are the right person, or they ensure they get me  to see the right person as you cannot always tell in an initial conversation."
Leiston,Online good,12/10/2022,4,I have used online systems and phone and I find it all very good and timely response.
Leiston,Poor,8/24/2017,1,Difficult to get appointments; took 3 1/2 weeks to see a specific doctor.  Dismissed concerns for a long time  which ended up having serious health implications
Leiston,Poor,8/15/2016,2,waiting too long for appointment when one needs treatment
Leiston,poor,9/30/2019,1,"I was feeling really, really unwell but ""the best we can do is 3 weeks""
Just ridiculous"
Leiston,poor,9/30/2019,2,had to wait 3 weeks until an appointment. The bus times do not match up very well with the appointment times they give.
Leiston,"Poor, difficult to get appointments.",4/18/2017,2,Difficult to get appointments.  Sat here for 5 minutes after my appointment time today
Leiston,Privacy is not good on reception,5/16/2019,4,In the main the surgery works well. I have concerns that confidentiality is not great if you are disclosing information to a receptionist on the front desk.
Leiston,Quite proactive,7/7/2023,4,"It can vary on who you see, but the GP I have been able to see has put 'things' in motion so that I do not need to chase things or remember when I need that next check or test.  For example: They contacted me to do the blood pressure home checks that was said by the GP 3 months ago, that I needed in 3 months. I therefore found this to be quite proactive."
Leiston,Service always good and kind,3/4/2019,5,Service always good and kind
Leiston,"Staff excellent, callback system poor",5/16/2019,4,"The staff are excellent. Not keen on the callback system, I have not seen a GP in ages and I was in hospital so expected some follow-up. I have trouble with transport to all the health services due to my rural location. Appointments were 25 minutes behind today."
Leiston,System takes longer,12/12/2018,4,"There has been many changes on how you get an appointment, and whilst the system takes longer, you do actually get to see your preferred GP, on the day usually."
Leiston,System works for me and my family,5/16/2019,5,"Not used the surgery very much, and the system for me and my family works very well. A call back saves a trip into the surgery. I even had a referral to hospital, which was very swift. No physical examination was needed, so it was appropriate."
Leiston,Take a while to get through,7/7/2023,4,"I ring first thing but it can take quite a long time to get through. I find seeing a paramedic is not good enough in some situations and just a barrier.
In my experience it is like you have to see a paramedic a few times before you get to see a GP, but that is still rare."
Leiston,Takes a while to get through on the phone,5/16/2019,4,"Apart from a bit of waiting at your appointment, I find things here are OK. Staff ask extra questions on the phone, which makes the phone calls longer, which in turn means it takes longer to get through."
Leiston,Telephone wait frustrating,7/7/2023,3,"Getting through on the telephone is frustrating. I ring at 8am and can still be 40th in the queue. 
Once you see someone it is ok, and all the staff are pretty lovely. Not seen a GP in ages."
Leiston,Treated with dignity & respect,6/22/2017,5,They have always treated me and my husband with respect and dignity.  They referred me recently to the hospital on a Friday morning and by the afternoon the hospital took me in for an appointment for an ultrasound
Leiston,Triage works well,12/12/2018,5,I find the surgery very good.  I think the triage system works very well.  I called in at 9.20 am and got an appointment for at 12 today.  As long as you don't miss your call back you get to see someone.  But it can be that you miss a call.  E.G. If have to pop to the shop.  This then can take longer.
Leiston,Well timed and convenient.,8/1/2018,5,A convenient appointment for a non-urgent issue. Minimal waiting time & GP seemed more relaxed and less rushed than visiting at my own GP surgery - although coincidentally I was seen by one of my practice's GPs.
Leiston,"Works for me, as it has for 70 years",5/16/2019,4,"Things work well for me here in the main, and I've been here for almost 70 years. Main change has been that you do not see your own GP any more, which I would prefer. Appointments today are running to time, it generally does when seeing a nurse."
Long Melford,2 week wait for appointment,1/20/2020,4,"There is at least a two week wait if I ring up for an appointment, everything else is good at this surgery. The notice boards are a bit tatty in the waiting area."
Long Melford,A bit frustrating,2/12/2021,4,"I've found it a bit frustrating or difficult as the phones are so busy in the mornings, I've been up to 50th in the queue. When through to the staff it all works with an initial call back from the doctor followed by a face to face appointment with doctors or nurses, so generally working ok. I can't use online services so econsult or the app are not an option for me."
Long Melford,A good practice,8/24/2019,4,"I've been here for 45 years. It's a good practice. I think the staff are professional, but customer service is at a personal level. If I don't understand something, I will ask, some GPs are better at this than others. The nurses and pharmacy are brilliant. I would have no suggestions for changes."
Long Melford,Appointments available,2/12/2021,4,Appointments are available when needed including face to face with a doctor and it all works well for me.
Long Melford,Bad experience but doctor nice,4/12/2015,3,Firstly the doctors recommended a cream which aggravated my leg/ankle even more. Bad experience but doctor very nice.
Long Melford,Booking appointments is a struggle,6/4/2018,3,"Never seem to be able to get an appointment and if you do, its about two weeks after you want it."
Long Melford,Brilliant,8/23/2018,5,A brilliant service where you can get appointments when you need them. Having the two surgeries is helpful and staff are all very good and helpful.
Long Melford,Brilliant,9/5/2018,5,"Brilliant. They have really fought to get me the care and support I needed from the mental health service. Staff are polite and friendly, all great."
Long Melford,Can get appointments,9/5/2018,4,I phone to make the appointments and can get them when needed. The staff are very friendly and approachable and nothing really needs changing.
Long Melford,Can get appointments when needed,3/9/2018,4,"Quite like the way staff are with you, they are nice and you can get appointments when you need them. I call to book my appointments which works well. Care navigation has been ok and I'm happy to see the most relevant person"
Long Melford,Cannot fault,1/9/2016,5,I really like this surgery and cannot fault it.
Long Melford,Confusion,12/12/2022,3,"After calling 111 overnight and being told a telephone consultation had been booked at the suregry I called the surgery to double check first thing in the morning and was told it was an in person appointment at the time i was advised. On arrival however, I was told it was actually 20 minutes later and should have been a phone call. I had to wait for the nurse to see me when they were available instead."
Long Melford,Diabetic reviews not done,4/25/2022,2,Getting medications are not a problem if you come to the pharmacy but doing it electronically doesn't seem to go smoothly for some reason so I've given up.  My diabetic reviews haven't been for some time now and getting to see a GP face to face is difficult. I contacted the surgery multiple times but was told I didn't need to be seen. Eventually I was sent for blood tests at west Suffolk hospital. I was called by the surgery the same morning to go straight back to hospital as I was very unwell and needed further treatment. If I'd been able to get to see someone earlier I would've been treated and properly diagnosed.  When you do have blood tests the staff aren't able to explain anything when they tell you the results so you then have to arrange to speak to a doctor.
Long Melford,Difficult to get a child seen,4/25/2022,2,"I've been trying to get a young child seen for months now, I've called at least 5 times and each time been told she didn't need to be seen. At one point, because I really wanted her to be seen, I was told that if I was to continue she definitely wouldn't be seen.  I don't feel her issues were being take seriously  at all and refusing to see such a young child can't be right. Just glad we've finally been seen."
Long Melford,Difficult to get a face to face,4/25/2022,4,"I've found it difficult to get a face to face appointment in the past. This is the first face to face I've had in a long time. I've been seen quickly once I had the triage call today with a GP so it has worked well today, so I'm happy."
Long Melford,Difficult to get an appointment,9/22/2016,2,Its very difficult to get an appointment. Three weeks is common and you can be so much worse in that time.
Long Melford,Difficult to get results,8/18/2021,2,Have not had a great time being able to get to see a doctor or being able to get test results. We've called multiple times to get results with no success.
Long Melford,Difficult to get through,12/12/2022,3,It is difficult to get through to the surgery and i've been up to 15th in the queue. It's not always easy to call dead on 8am either and when you do get through you are often told there are no appointments available and to call back the next day. Once you get to speak to a GP its ok as the care is good but if the issue isn't urgent it can be more difficult getting to see someone. I've used econsult but found it very time consuming and drawn out. The NHS app doesn't seem to work well either. The appointments offered from Lavenham surgery are very limited and seem to mainly be clinics. Some pre booked appoinments still mean you have to have a call back before being given a face to face appointment. Staff though are good when you do get to see them.
Long Melford,Difficult to see my GP,6/22/2018,3,It's very difficult to see my own GP. I'd prefer to see the same doctor as they know my history and other doctors don't understand or get what has happened. The Gp's when you see them are the best.
Long Melford,Difficult to see specific doctors,9/5/2018,4,Very difficult to book advanced appointments with specific doctors. The care provided by staff is very good but I don't particularly like being asked why I need the appointment.
Long Melford,Doctor a bit sharp in tone,1/20/2020,4,"One of the doctors at this surgery is a bit sharp and abrupt in tone, she also does not always explain things well either, but the other doctors are much better."
Long Melford,Doctor listens well,1/20/2020,4,"Doctor is very good, he listens well, it is a good surgery overall, if they could just make the wait shorter to get an appointment it would be so much better."
Long Melford,Doctors and nurses great,3/9/2018,3,I feel that the care navigation process is flawed as I have to wait about a month to get an appointment. The doctors and nurses here are great though once you see them
Long Melford,Doctors are very good,8/24/2019,4,"I have to go to Sudbury Medical Centre to get my regular blood tests, which can be inconvenient. The doctors are very good here and booking appointments seem fine. I don't need to change anything."
Long Melford,Doctors Excellent,1/20/2020,4,I find the tone of one of the ladies on the phone to be a bit sharp and that it is more of a chore for them to do their job. The doctors are excellent. I waited on the phone this morning for 40 minutes before they answered. My doctor is excellent.
Long Melford,Doctors listen,12/24/2018,5,"Staff are friendly, doctors listen. The wait to get through on the phone is the biggest issue, today it wasn't excessively long.  Online booing works well for future appointments, it would be helpful if you could book B12 injections online too to help you to plan ahead."
Long Melford,Don't like that using online is expected,2/12/2021,3,I find that reception staff often just expect me to use online systems and I can't and I feel it is wrong to expect me to especially considering my age and the fact I never have used them.
Long Melford,Dr.  was very sensitive/ informative,10/29/2015,5,I went to Dr. (Name removed) to discuss the menopause.  He was completely interested and gave me the service I needed.  I was very impressed
Long Melford,Drawn out process,12/12/2022,3,The biggest issue is the drawn out process of getting  an appointment. The phones are busy so it takes time to get through and you can be 20th in the queue. Then you have to tell reception what the problem is and wait for a GP to call you back and then after a conversation with them they decide if it is then deemed appropriate for you to come in to the surgery and have a face to face appointment.  I just don't understand how this system saves time or resources for them.
Long Melford,Easy to get an appointment.,3/2/2017,5,Friendly and approachable staff and easy to get appointment.  Appointment times are good at the surgery and they will go out of their way to help
Long Melford,Enjoy the staff's attitudes,6/4/2018,5,Everyone is always friendly
Long Melford,Excellent,4/25/2022,4,The phone lines are busy so I came down to discuss things today rather than calling. I've used econsult it worked well and they used zoom to see something rather than calling me in to the surgery. I just worry what would happen if I needed urgent care and whether I'd get an appointment.
Long Melford,Excellent,10/11/2016,5,"Getting an appointment this week has not been a problem,  Staff have been good."
Long Melford,Excellent and easy getting appointments,3/10/2017,5,It's a good surgery;  will do house visits when needed and getting appointments isn't a problem.  They will always fit you in if  it's urgent
Long Melford,Excellent doctors,5/9/2018,5,Been very good over the years. Having good continuity with the doctors is really good. I called this morning and given an appointment straight away. I think that the care navigation is a good idea and the receptionists are always very helpful.
Long Melford,Fair but staff can be rude and don't like triage system,3/20/2017,3,"Can feel like you have to answer a lot of questions.  I don't particularly like the triage system.  After spending 10 minutes on the phone, you then have to come in anyway.  At times reception staff can be a little rude when trying to organise appointments"
Long Melford,Friendly atmosphere,9/5/2018,5,"A friendly atmosphere at the surgery. You do have to wait a long time to get an appointment with any of the doctors, a few weeks ago it was nearly 4 weeks. You can be told to book appointments in 3 weeks by the doctor but when you try reception are unable to do this but if you try nearer the time the appointments aren't available."
Long Melford,Friendly staff,12/24/2018,4,"It takes a very long time to get through on the phone in the morning, sometimes up to 1/2 hr. The phone system offers a call back on option 5 but this doesn't work and then you are cut off. Staff are friendly but it is easier to book appointments at the surgery than it is by phone. Once you do get through you will get a appointment to see someone. It's not always who you'd like to see but they are generally very good. Sometimes it does appear they are short of staff."
Long Melford,Friendly staff,9/5/2018,4,Easy to get an appointment or have a call back with a doctor and the staff are friendly.  The phone message about care navigation was clear and easy to understand and I'm not worried by the receptionists asking the reason for the appointment.
Long Melford,Frustrating,2/12/2021,3,"I do find you have to chase things at times for them to be done. I've had telephone consultations so far but do not get offered a face to face appointment, Doctors are thorough when you do talk to them though."
Long Melford,Frustrating time on the phone,4/25/2022,4,"It took  20 minutes to get through on the phone this morning but after speaking to staff I had a call back from the GP and they have arranged the medication for me to pick up. Staff are very helpful, they talked me through how to get online step by step."
Long Melford,Generally good,1/20/2020,4,All generally good here. It takes a week or so for a non emergency appointment and this could be better I think. But overall no real changes needed.
Long Melford,Generally happy with appointments,6/14/2018,3,"Trying to get an appointment is now more difficult with the new system for ongoing issues as I know I will need to come in but for everyday things it has worked well. Today, we have an appointment. In general very happy with appointments and nurses are very good. It can be difficult to get through on the phone to people, to clear problems up."
Long Melford,Get appointments quite quickly,3/9/2018,4,Not too many people so you can get appointments quite quickly. It can be off putting having to discuss issues in the waiting area as it is so quiet and everyone can hear. Generally been ok though.
Long Melford,getting an appointment is quite easy.,8/24/2019,5,Getting an appointment is quite easy here. I am happy to have a selection of doctors rather than just keeping the same one. I am more than happy with both this site and Lavenham. No changes needed as far as I'm concerned.
Long Melford,Getting to and from appointments is difficult,9/29/2016,3,I don't like having to go to Long Melford to get appointments quicker.  With an ageing population in the village and less public transport getting to and from appointments is difficult.
Long Melford,Given wrong advice,2/12/2021,4,I spoke to a locum and was told to come to the surgery to pick up a prescription to take it to the pharmacy for my mum but when I got here it's already been sent to the pharmacy so I've had a bit of a wasted journey. Not a big problem just glad it's all been sorted and its at the pharmacy.
Long Melford,Good appointments system,7/24/2017,5,Good booking system.  No difficulty getting appointments when needed for regular injections.
Long Melford,Good care but hard to get appointment,9/21/2017,4,Can be difficult to get an appointment at the surgery but care is good
Long Melford,Good service,10/11/2016,4,Having a local surgery is very important.  Can get appointments when needed.  Generally happy with the service.  It's good the doctor comes out to call me in but I do struggle at times to hear due to background noise.
Long Melford,Good support from diabetic nurse,12/24/2018,5,"All works very well, never had any problems and can get appointments. You can talk to reception about what you need the appointment for and they will either get you one or you talk to the duty doctor and they can then suggest whether to come in or follow another course of action. I was asked to attend a medication review but when I went in I was asked why I was there, I don't think my notes had been read. Communication between the hospital and the surgery is very good and I get good support from the diabetic nurse."
Long Melford,Good surgery,12/19/2018,5,Its a good surgery where you can choose the location of your appointment and which doctor you can see. I don't have any issues with the surgery at all.
Long Melford,"GP's good, making appointments very hard",11/17/2016,3,To get to see a doctor can take 3 weeks.  I am confident in the ability of the doctors I do see
Long Melford,Great once you get to see someone,9/5/2018,3,"A great surgery once you get to see someone. Getting appointments for non urgent  issues takes a long time, this time it has been three weeks to see a specific member of staff."
Long Melford,Great staff,9/29/2016,5,Generally an excellent service with great reception and medical staff.
Long Melford,"Great, works well",6/10/2016,4,"I saw a locum this week, i called and was seen in 3 hours, great. Depending on who you seen the information provided can vary. The surgery works well and staff are all very friendly."
Long Melford,Has improved,12/12/2022,4,It feels like it has improved in recent weeks and you can now get appointments (prebooked) more easily.  I've had a bit over a weeks wait to see the nurse practitioner and when I called I was first in the queue and didn't have to wait long. Reception staff are good and they are so helpful.
Long Melford,Helped me when needed,11/12/2015,4,I had an ear infection and they helped me.
Long Melford,I like everything about the surgery.,3/2/2017,5,I like everything about the surgery and the doctors listen to me when I have a problem.  I go with my support worker and they make sure everything is explained
Long Melford,If urgent seen on the day,2/1/2019,4,"It all seems very rushed now, at the appointments you feel you you need a bit more time. I tend to book online for non urgent issues and this work well but for more urgent problems they will always fit you in on the day."
Long Melford,impressed,8/17/2016,5,A really good surgery very impressed
Long Melford,Incredibly busy today,2/12/2021,5,"With the new IT system going in today it is incredibly busy but I can't fault the surgery they've been great, especially considering whats going on. I've never had any problems getting appointments when I've needed them."
Long Melford,Lack of appointments,12/12/2022,3,"I've not seen the diabetic nurse for 3 yrs as they only offer appointments on certain days and I work away so can't make the days offered.  They've said in effect I'm declining appointments but there is no flexibility. I've also had a medication review with a pharmacist where we discussed the meds I'm on but they didn't have the blood test result that normally go with a review and yet it was all signed off.  The online prescription service on the NHS app doesn't seem to have all my medications on it so I can't order them through it. I have continued with the old system and this works very well and the deliveries are great.  It still feels like we're under lockdown rules, nothing has really changed. I don't feel there is anything proactive coming from the surgery around flu or covid vaccinations, it all comes from Government first."
Long Melford,Less than helpful,8/10/2020,2,Very hard to get through on the phone and reluctance to do hone visits. Never seeing the same doctor .
Long Melford,Like the duty doctor system,9/5/2018,4,"I phoned this morning and was given an appointment straight away. I liked the duty system, I spoke with the doctor and they said to come down to the surgery. I'm generally happy with the surgery."
Long Melford,Like the queue system on the phones,12/24/2018,4,"They do their best. Urgent appointments are easy to get but non urgent take more time especially if you'd like to see a specific doctor. To get through on the phone can take a while, it was 20 minutes this morning, but it is Monday. I like the queue system on the phone but it would be improved if it said where you are in the queue. I'm quite happy with reception asking why the appointment is needed. Its only when you want to see someone specific that it takes longer to get an appointment."
Long Melford,Listen to you,9/8/2018,5,"They treat you as a person, are very friendly and listen to what you're saying and address issues raised. Having earlier or later appointments available would be helpful as I work out of the area."
Long Melford,Mix up with appointment location,1/20/2020,3,"I was told that I was booked in at Lavenham surgery with my baby but when I arrived I was told it was at Long Melford so I am now late, my baby is 6 weeks old and I was told the injection can be given at 7 weeks old so I am sure they will turn me away, I am not at all happy today I feel like making a complaint about today."
Long Melford,Most staff very good.,9/8/2018,4,Most staff are very good and will do all they can to fit you in for an appointment and help. I was asked by the GP to come back in two weeks but when I tried to book the appointment none were available.
Long Melford,Much better than previous surgery,4/9/2015,5,"Much better, I am treated like a human being by the staff  here"
Long Melford,My husband is profoundly deaf,8/9/2021,1,"He visited a doctor today with myself, I informed doctor that he won't understand him with his mask on but still tried asking him questions without removing his mask which my husband found embarrassing, and the doctor couldn't understand him so we had a 3 way conversation going on.."
Long Melford,Needed system to be easier,8/24/2019,3,The first available appointment when I rang today was in three weeks. But I explained that I was needed sooner as in pain. Duty doctor called me back. I needed the appointment system to be easier next time please.
Long Melford,Needs more personal centred care,6/18/2016,4,this practice needs more personal centred care
Long Melford,Nice and friendly,9/5/2018,5,"Very nice and friendly nurses. I normally come to the surgery to make appointments which works well, Never had a problem."
Long Melford,No appointments available,3/13/2018,1,"Spent a full day trying to book an appt to see a GP, couldn't get through. Went into surgery to book it to be told there's no appointments available."
Long Melford,No appointments for ear syringing,12/12/2017,3,Have tried to get an appointment to have my ears syringed but have been told there are no appointments available.
Long Melford,No complaints,8/24/2019,4,I do not have any complaints about this surgery. The GP sent me to hospital last week via paramedic. I feel very cared for here.
Long Melford,No continuity of care with the GPs,6/14/2018,3,"No continuity of care with the GPs,so for ongoing issues, you don't see the same person and it gives you a feeling that no one actually knows you or cares. If you do need an appointment, you will always be able to get one. Can be a little lacking in care and interest following a major operation."
Long Melford,No problems getting appointments,4/25/2022,4,"I've had a mix of appointments, face to face with a GP and on the phone which have all addressed the issues I've had. I have had problems doing repeat prescriptions electronically when medication wasn't there when it had been ordered but the pharmacy staff have been great and sorted it all out quickly."
Long Melford,no problems with surgery,8/17/2016,5,I really like the surgery and cannot fault my GP
Long Melford,Non urgent appointments can take time to get,12/24/2018,4,"To get a non urgent appointment with a nurse or doctor take a long time for the nurse it can be 3 weeks and to see a specific GP 5-6 weeks. If its an urgent appointment you will get seen on the day after explaining the situation or issue is to reception. Even after pressing option 4 for results it can take 10 minutes to have your call answered. Doctors are very good and I'm confident in the care and treatment provided. I can and will go to Lavenham if necessary for a quicker appointment. It is difficult to know whether you're issue is important and whether you need an urgent appointment or not. It would be nice to have the clock back in the waiting area again, there used to be one."
Long Melford,Not viewed holistically,9/5/2018,3,"Don't always feel that I'm viewed holistically and listened to, issues are put down to the condition I have when they may be totally unrelated. You get to the point where you think what do you do now."
Long Melford,Nurse practitioners are very good,12/14/2017,4,The nurse practitioners are very good. They really do care and are very approachable.
Long Melford,Nurses very good,4/25/2022,4,Getting through on the phone does take some time but once you are  through you get an appointment. The doctors and nurses are very good and I feel that you get to see the most appropriate person for the issue. I'm very happy with the care provided.
Long Melford,outstanding,6/16/2020,5,Seen quickly and efficiently by GP but had 3 weeks wait to wait for appointment
Long Melford,Outstanding.,8/24/2019,5,"My experience here is outstanding. I've been here many years, the staff are friendly and obliging. Excellent service today with having a quick ECG. Both GPs and nurses are very good and very approachable. I feel we are very lucky to have this surgery."
Long Melford,Phone consultations have worked,4/25/2022,4,To see a doctor is difficult but to be fair I've had telephone consultations with a GP and they've addressed the issues. I just think with my ongoing issues a face to face would be better.
Long Melford,phones,4/25/2022,4,"Phones are frustrating, I spent most of the afternoon trying to get through but I'm happy I've been given an appointment and seen the doctor now."
Long Melford,Phones are busy,2/12/2021,3,"Getting through on the phones is difficult, it never seems to get answered which is frustrating."
Long Melford,Phones busy,12/12/2022,4,The phones are busy and I've waited up to 25 minutes to get through. Once you're given a call back the afternoon slot is 2-5 pm otherwise if it's urgent they tend to call sooner.  Appointments with the nurse are easy enough to book and for this appointment it wasn't urgent but I did need a double appointment so I've had to wait a week for a double slot. I did see an inexperienced GP recently and was sent to A&E unnecessarily and the doctor I saw there was not pleased I'd been advised to go there as I waited 6 hours to be seen only to be given medication that the GP could've given me.
Long Melford,Polite and friendly,8/24/2019,5,"They always seem to fit me in, appointment fine. polite and friendly staff. It would be beneficial if they operated a late night surgery. I am very pleased with this surgery no issues."
Long Melford,Polite staff,9/8/2018,5,"No problems at all with the surgery. The staff are polite, you can't always get appointments what you want but other than that its good and they do what they can to help. If you want to see a specific doctor it can be a bit of a wait and when you have an appointment you are not rushed which is great."
Long Melford,poor,9/30/2019,1,If telephoning for a non-urgent (but necessary) appointment  we aare told there are no appointments for 4 weeks.  This really is unacceptable.
Long Melford,Poor communication between GP's and Pharmacy,1/20/2020,3,"I feel that the communication between doctor and pharmacy is poor. I had a new medication given to me without advising me. Nurses are excellent, doctors and nurse practitioners are very good most of the time.It feels to me that the quality of care is slipping from what it was mainly because they appear to be under pressure."
Long Melford,Prefer the old system,12/4/2022,4,"The surgery is ok, I did prefer the old system when you could be seen face to face more easily by a GP. Today's appointment was with a nurse who was fantastic as she put me at ease and made me feel really comfortable about everything, she was great very reassuring."
Long Melford,Prescriptions are an issue,4/25/2022,3,The biggest ongoing issue is prescriptions with the surgery and the pharmacy each blaming each other for the problems.
Long Melford,Pretty good,2/1/2019,4,Always managed to get an appointment when I've needed one. Not always as quick as I'd like but normally pretty good. Its a bit frustrating as it takes a while to get through on the phone. Early in the year it took a month to get a routine appointment. Nurses are more accessible and the use of them has been an improvement.
Long Melford,Prostate cancer referral,1/20/2020,5,"I like the fact that some patients are invited to come up to the surgery and sit a wait for the doctor. This surgery have looked after me so well, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, they made a quick referral to West Suffolk Hospital. I would like to see a walk in surgery in the Long Melford surgery"
Long Melford,Quick appointments,9/8/2018,5,"I phoned up 1/2hr ago and was given an appointment straight away. I like having the dispensary to collect medication from. The automated phone system is a bit frustrating but not too bad, just takes time."
Long Melford,Reception area not very private,9/8/2018,4,Generally it all works okay and you can normally get appointments. I don't feel that the reception area is very private and it is an issue if you have something confidential to say. I'd like to be able to see the clock returned to the waiting room. They do pretty well on the whole but theres no consistency with the doctor you see. Care navigation is a good idea and should help you to see the right person. Eye contact from staff and the personal touch from them could be better.
Long Melford,Reception mistake,12/12/2022,3,"I booked an appointment by visiting one of the surgeries and the time and date was written down for me but on arrival I was told the appointment should've been 2 hours earlier. They wouldn't see me and I had to book another appointment for the following day.  The nurses that I see are good, the phones are busy and it does take time to get through which is why I visit the suregry to arrange appointments."
Long Melford,Reduced explanation due to age,12/10/2015,4,If a younger family member accompanies me to an appointment we get much more information from the practitioner than if I go on my own. It seems that because I'm old they think I don't need all the information.
Long Melford,Saturday/Evening Surgery,6/12/2015,4,It would be good to have a Saturday or evening surgery.
Long Melford,Seem to lack doctors,2/12/2021,3,"The language used by some staff can be off putting and can make it feel that you are being brushed off. It seems that the practice lacks doctors and its frustrating that its very difficult to get home visits. Once out the doctors are amazing, just a shame it's so difficult."
Long Melford,Staff are very good,7/11/2018,4,They do fit you in as quickly as they can. I don't particularly like the call back system as I would only call if I needed an appointment. I' happy to ask staff for information if I'm unsure but generally staff are very good.
Long Melford,Staff do not listen,8/24/2021,1,"I had a Dr laugh in my face about an issue I was experiencing as I did not feel like I was being listened to. They acted in a way that made me feel stupid and a nuisance to them. Awfully long wait times when calling, and unhelpful."
Long Melford,Staff friendly,5/9/2018,5,It can be a bit awkward getting urgent appointments although you can have the choice of Lavenham as well. I would like to see some magazines or books to read as when you visit regularly it helps you to relax.
Long Melford,Staff have been good,5/9/2018,5,"Never had any trouble here, when I've been ill I can always get an appointment. Staff have all been good and I don't mind being asked the reason for my appointment so they can book me in with the most relevant person"
Long Melford,Surgery is good,9/8/2018,5,"This surgery is good, the care provided is great and the staff are helpful."
Long Melford,System has changed but worked,2/1/2019,5,A bit of a change in the system but I did get to speak to the duty doctor and they called me back an hour after I'd phoned which was good. They are doing their best and the care is good.
Long Melford,Takes time to be seen,9/5/2018,3,Its difficult to get convenient appointments around work. When you do see anyone they are very good but it just takes time to be seen and for action to be taken. I would prefer more advanced appointments to be available
Long Melford,The new appointment system works very well,6/14/2018,4,"I do like the new system, you get callbacks within about 10 minutes, which is great and an appointment has followed or it's been dealt with over the phone."
Long Melford,Treatment and care good,12/24/2018,4,"Took 11/2 hrs to get through on the phone this morning and I'm concerned about the number of patients joining the surgery, over the last year it has definitely taken longer to get through. Once you are in the surgery the treatment and care is very good. It's literally just getting through that is the problem. I'm happy to explain why the appointment is needed and was impressed how quickly I received a call back from the doctor. The nurses are very good and make sure that you have all the information and support you need."
Long Melford,triage works well,9/8/2018,5,"Its a good clean and tidy surgery. It can be a long wait to see a doctor for a general appointment. If you need an appointment on the day you will get one and the triage system works well, with things being dealt with on the phone."
Long Melford,Understand they are busy,12/12/2022,3,It's Ok but if you miss 8am when you call by the time you get through there are no call backs available and you're asked to call again the next day.
Long Melford,Understand they're busy,8/12/2022,3,It's ok but if you call at 8am and then there are no call backs available that day you're asked to call back the next day and try again which is frustrating. I do understand that they are busy and its not easy.
Long Melford,Very caring,3/9/2018,5,The staff at the surgery are very good. They are very caring and make sure that they stay aware of your conditions.  They have a good diary system but it is difficult to sometimes see your own doctor but the care provided by others has been good. Call backs have been very good and worked well.  They came out to the house and were wonderful. Excellent surgery.
Long Melford,very efficient,8/24/2019,5,I find this surgery to be very efficient. They try hard to find out what is the problem is and get diagnosed and sorted. The staff on reception and in the dispensary are first class.
Long Melford,Very good,2/12/2021,4,Its a very good surgery however I'm having to come here to drop off a prescription as I can't do it at the Lavenham surgery now as it's closed to patients due to covid. It would be helpful to have a box to put them in at both surgeries so you don't have to go in the building.
Long Melford,Very good care,7/24/2017,4,"Excellent surgery, for specific doctors it's more difficult to get an appointment.  Care provided by the surgery is very good.  With comprehensive notes it's not vital to see the same GP each time."
Long Melford,Very good surgery,5/20/2016,5,I've always had very good relations with the surgery. Care is always very good.
Long Melford,Very happy with econsult,2/12/2021,4,"Very happy with how econsult works and it avoids callong the practice and the busy phone lines. Before covid hit my daughter received really good mental health support from the GP, a shame it couldn't continue."
Long Melford,Very helpful,3/9/2018,5,"Normally quite straight forward to get appointments. Very helpful, staff take my hearing issues in to consideration when talking to me."
Long Melford,Very helpful staff,9/5/2018,5,"Friendly reception staff, I can get appointments when I need them. Getting my prescription is easy enough and they are always ready for collection. Very helpful staff too."
Long Melford,Very impressed,1/9/2016,5,A really good surgery - very impressed.
Long Melford,Very supportive staff,7/24/2017,5,Been with the practice a long time and they've always been great; a very supportive surgery. They treated my husband brilliantly
Long Melford,Waiting times not too bad,12/24/2018,4,"Pleasant treatment from both the nurses and doctors, I'm happy to attend either of the practices for appointments. You can wait a while at reception to be dealt with but waiting times with in the surgery for appointments aren't too bad, getting appointments however can be a little difficult. You can't always get an appointment when you need one or in advance and you have to revert to an on the day appointment."
Long Melford,Waits on the phone,4/25/2022,3,"Waiting half an hour on the phone to speak to someone is common and because I don't use online there is no other choice other than to phone.  There is no choice other than to have a call back from a GP even if I can't hear what is being said well. I had a face to face appointment today with a GP where I explained how difficult I find speaking on the phone but my next appointment will be a phone call, no choice."
Long Melford,Well run surgery,1/20/2020,4,"I think they run this surgery well. They seem to have a lot of part time doctors, continuity of the same clinical practitioner could be better, having to explain things over and over to new people is frustrating."
Long Melford,Wheelchair access is difficult,10/1/2022,3,"Accessing the building at Long Melford is difficult in a wheelchair due to the double doors, it's slightly better and easier at Lavenham.  I wasn't able to get a face to face appointment with a doctor, I did speak to 4 different doctors on the phone but I ended up in hospital."
Long Melford,Wish I had longer.,8/24/2019,4,Sometimes you have to book three weeks in advance for an appointment. I wish I could have longer for my appointments. I will only see some doctors. I have the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatic and one doctor sent me to get ibuprofen and I felt let down.
Long Melford,Worked really well,4/25/2022,5,"This is the first time I've needed an appointment in years. I called up, had a call back from the doctor and I was given an appointment straight away which has worked really well. From my point of view its all been great, I'm very happy."
Long Melford,Working patients need to be considered,1/20/2020,3,"When people work full time this needs to be taken into consideration by the surgery when  appointments are offered, having to wait for 2 weeks for an appointment in my opinion is too long. I do think that the doctors are better in Long Melford than they are in Lavenham."
Long Melford,Would like to talk to a specific GP,2/12/2021,4,"I've previously spoken with one of the GPs about an issue I have and would like to do so again but it has proved very difficult. You have to wait on the phone in a queue, I've got to eighth in line and then it just rings and rings and doesn't get answered which is not helpful."
Long Melford,You can always get an emergency appointment,9/29/2016,4,Getting to see a specific doctor is more difficult but you can always get an emergency appointment if you need one.
Long Melford,You can generally get appointments,9/29/2016,5,You can generally get appointments very  easily.  I don't generally see my own GP but anyone else or a nurse.  Service works well and meets needs.
Long Melford,You will get an appointment,12/24/2018,5,If you need to see a doctor you will get an appointment with someone at the surgery which is important. I did have an issue where I wasn't listened to and this resulted in unwanted medication being prescribed. I did also try to raise another issue which is normally ok but was told another appointment would be needed.
Longshore,45 re-rings!,1/23/2020,3,"I called on my mobile 45 times this morning to get through, but I did and I did get an appointment.  It just gets frustrating having to keep ringing like that, especially when you are on school run or heading to work."
Longshore,A good service,6/4/2019,5,"A good service received at all times. Including access to appointments and kind, caring professional staff."
Longshore,Access is difficult,2/13/2019,5,"Getting an appointment over the telephone can be quite difficult, however when you manage to, the person you see is always professional and listens well."
Longshore,Access more difficult,1/23/2020,3,Access is much more difficult here than it used to be.  I am here today as I needed to see a GP on the day and my local one in Wrentham has no GP until later in the week.  People are queuing outside in the morning which means those on the phone do not get appointments as easily.  I feel this is unfair.
Longshore,Access to appointments is varied,6/4/2019,4,"Things vary here for access to appointments. If you turn up and queue you get an appointments, yet calling on the telephone is very difficult if you need to see someone that day."
Longshore,Alternative offered,2/13/2019,5,"I rang Wrentham as it is more local to me, but I was offered 5pm here at Kessingland, which I could not make.  They then said I could come in earlier if I am happy to see a student Doctor for a 1/2 hr appointment, so I opted for that.  It was all very satisfactory and thorough."
Longshore,Always been excellent,7/12/2018,5,"The surgery has always been excellent. Appointments do sometimes run a little behind,,, but no more than 10 minutes"
Longshore,Appointments at Wrentham difficult to get,6/13/2016,1,Getting appointments is very difficult as the surgery only has a doctor two or three times a week. If you can't drive it is then difficult to get to the other surgeries. Reception staff aren't very helpful when you say getting to the other surgeries is really difficult. The bus from Southwold to Gt Yarmouth is stopping in July and this will make getting to James Paget Hospital difficult.
Longshore,Appointments can be difficult to get,6/4/2019,3,Access can be difficult when you can only ring in. It's taken me 3 days to get an appointment and I've been calling in at 8.30am each morning. It can be very stressful.
Longshore,Asking extra questions,2/13/2019,4,"They are now starting to ask extra questions, which I feel is fine if you are at home on the telephone, but awkward if you walk-in.  The HWS CDO suggested asking if I could write it down, and the Receptionist would allow that.  So I will think to do that in future.  My GP is great and referred me on for appropriate treatment at James Paget"
Longshore,Could have been better,10/28/2022,4,"I had inflammation in both my eyes and lots of painful lumps all over both my eyelids and rang for an appointment. I got a phone appointment but was diagnosed over the phone, no face to face needed. This wasn't my doctor but a locum or something. When I told him I was allergic to the antibiotics he was prescribing, he wasn't pleased and said I had to use something. The eye condition I had resulted in my sight deteriorating badly in one eye and I still have a lump in one eyelid. I believe all this eye trouble resulted from my 2nd COVID vaccine."
Longshore,Coverage at Wrentham is limited,6/13/2016,3,Some of the reception staff have a bad attitude and coverage at the surgery is limited and if there is holiday they don't put on a surgery in the village. More often you have to go to one of the other surgeries. When you do see a doctor they are good.
Longshore,delay unacceptable,9/1/2020,5,"Prefer to go to Wrentham/Wangford but came here today as was urgent for my child, so got in, but 40 mins behind at 10am (due to IT issues). The clinicians are excellent."
Longshore,Excellent,8/15/2016,5,Very good in every department
Longshore,excellent,8/15/2016,5,"smart, clean, helpful, short waiting times, good explanations and quality of care"
Longshore,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Find appointment systems not good at times, having to ring on day."
Longshore,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"I have nothing negative to say, only that I understand doctors are up against it so I understand if I have to wait."
Longshore,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,everything satisfactory
Longshore,Excellent Nursing,1/2/2019,5,"As often is the case, I see the nurse here and she is excellent.  It is a first class service and staff are always helpful.
Phoning up in the morning is the only issue I can think of that is difficult."
Longshore,Excellent surgery,6/26/2023,5,I cannot fault the surgery. Every NHS service has it's challenges and under these circumstances they do excellent.
Longshore,Extremely good service,10/8/2016,5,"I have nothing to complain about. I get appointments when I need them, although admittedly this is rare. Staff are lovely and the place is a nice environment."
Longshore,First Class,1/2/2019,5,The nurse here is great and the service overall is first class.  Everyone is caring and helpful.
Longshore,Frustrating trying to get through,7/12/2018,3,"I get very frustrated trying to get through on the telephone in the morning for an appointment. I have been to A & E at James Paget when I needed to see someone and not been able to see my GP. I also use the local pharmacy, but when I need pain relief I feel I need to see the GP as they are more able to medically assess that pain."
Longshore,Getting through difficult,7/10/2018,4,"Apart from getting through in the morning to get to see a GP on the day, I find the service to be good overall"
Longshore,Given appointment for child,2/13/2019,5,"When I eventually get through I always get an appointment on the day for my new born.  For me it is not as accessible, but as long as I can get my child in I am happy."
Longshore,Good for appointments,6/13/2016,4,If I ever need an appointment I can get one and staff attitude has been good. As a carer if I call for a house visit it is never a problem.
Longshore,Good support,4/4/2022,5,"I’ve found the ongoing support I get around my mental health excellent from my GP.
In for bloods today that run very efficiently"
Longshore,Got appointment today,4/4/2022,3,Has been difficult to get appointments but today I got through quite quick on the telephone and got GP appointment for my child. All was sorted quickly.
Longshore,Heard nothing,4/11/2021,4,It was my blood pressure. I did 2 weeks worth of arm monitoring as requested. I took the graph in and have heard nothing so have not submitted any more as no guidance on what to do next.
Longshore,Helpful and polite,2/13/2019,4,Receptionists are always helpful and polite.  Have always received excellent service at this surgery from the GP's and Nurses
Longshore,"Helpful, cannot fault them",7/12/2018,5,"As I am visually impaired I am pleased that the surgery staff, whether it is the GP or Phlebotomist, they always come out to get me, as I cannot see the screen.
They are so helpful, I cannot fault them."
Longshore,Helps to be in a group of practices,7/10/2018,5,I usually go to Wangford or Wrentham surgeries as they are closer. I had to cancel my appointment there yesterday. I was able to travel here today and do not mind as they are smaller part-time surgeries. I was pleased I could still see someone a day later.
Longshore,Hit & Miss,1/23/2020,5,"Surgery access can be hit and miss but I cannot fault the care they have for us as a family.  With 1 disabled child and 1 other both with poor Mental Health, along with myself. When people queue up to get appointments, I feel it is unfair for those who cannot do that and it is really difficult to get through on the telephone, so that would be my only negative about the place."
Longshore,I find everything really good here,6/4/2019,5,I find everything really good here. Access appointments when I need them and all staff are warm and friendly.
Longshore,I trust the GPs here,6/4/2019,5,"I'm able to see the same GP which is important to me. I get anxious and worried and do not trust all people due to poor past experience, yet I find I've found GPs here that I trust."
Longshore,I walk-in now,1/2/2019,4,Cannot always get through so I end up walking down on the day I need appointment.  Reception staff are always very helpful.
Longshore,Inequality of access,6/4/2019,3,There is an inequality of access to appointments favouring those who can stand and wait prior to surgery opening. Many people who are able to queue at the door all get appointments There can be more than 15 people doing that. I call and am 12th in the telephone queue and by the time I get through all appointments have gone and I am unable to turn up and queue due to mobility issues. But my family do this.
Longshore,Just cannot get my medication right,10/16/2017,1,"I have had continued issues around the medication I have been put on. I have experienced horrible side affects and the GP does not seem interested. I have even tried to talk to the pharmacist, and I have had different makes of the same tablet. Hard to see the same GP to have a continued conversation about it, so I have had to stop having them even though they are probably quite important. Seeing GP again in couple of weeks."
Longshore,Linked appointment,1/23/2020,4,Came in today to get blood test results and was told that the GP will see me about them at the same time.  Not sure what would have happened if I had not physically come in. Excellent service considering appointments with GP's can be like gold dust!
Longshore,Long wait,2/13/2019,4,"Mostly satisfied with this service.
Always a really long waiting time (up to 30 mins) when coming for appointment"
Longshore,Longshore surgeries,10/21/2019,5,"For patients with complex problems, they are excellent at being the central part to co-ordinate care. Presentation of the building could be a bit more colourful. Really good team with complimenting skills and specialisms."
Longshore,look after me very well,4/4/2022,5,I come in for regular blood tests and they call me for that. I feel seeing a GP is much more difficult now though but I’ve not needed to for some time.
Longshore,Need to queue in person to get appointment,6/4/2019,5,I can access the service well if I go to the surgery and queue. Telephone is another matter! Many people do this now for the same reasons.
Longshore,No Holistic approach,2/13/2019,3,Not great at listening as tied to 'one thing'.  I find it difficult to be seen and they need to have more of a holistic approach as I have conditions that are connected
Longshore,Normally great service,9/1/2020,5,Everything normally is great here.  This time is the only time the wait has been very long  40 mins). Clinicians are excellent.
Longshore,Nothing is too much trouble,6/1/2017,5,This is a very good surgery-nothing is too much trouble
Longshore,On the whole it is a good surgery,3/17/2016,4,The trouble I have in the main is trying to get an appointment on the telephone.
Longshore,Phone almost 100 times,2/13/2019,3,"When I phone in, it can take ages to get thorough, today it was almost 100 times.  (my phone shows you the amount you have rang a number).
I feel it is silly giving one problem in your appointment as the GP will not get the full picture when things are linked.  I have had wrong diagnosis due to this issue.  One problem only takes a couple of minutes."
Longshore,Phone call access,1/23/2020,4,"We find access on the telephone sometimes is impossible as it coincides with the time we need to go on the school run (8.30am). the surgery needs to open lines earlier, many surgeries open at 8am so not sure why this one does not."
Longshore,Queue at door,2/13/2019,4,Not had any problems here since I decided I would choose to come down for 8.30 am.  This queue is getting longer and when we talk in the queue it is because people cannot stand waiting as long as they do on the telephone.  It gets stressful on the telephone.
Longshore,Queue up now,1/23/2020,4,"My partner queues up now at 8am to ensure I get an appointment (surgery does not open until 8.30am).  I do get an appointment, and I am terminally ill, so it is important to me to see the same person who knows me.  toady I was lucky to get an 'online' cancellation.  We have been 3rd in the queue on the telephone yet when we got through no appointments were left.  So queueing for me is the only guaranteed way to access the service."
Longshore,Quick referral,7/10/2018,5,"My GP, when I moved here a year ago, referred me straight to Norfolk and Norwich as I have a lump on my neck. My previous surgery told me it was my glands. I was glad I moved. I have now had surgery for a cancerous lump and I am being treated."
Longshore,Right person at right time,1/2/2019,5,The service is very good once you get through on the telephone.  They allocate you the right person at the right time.  My only issue is that I have to ring many times before speaking to someone.
Longshore,Rings and rings....,1/2/2019,4,"I do not ring the surgery as it just rings and rings.  So I just turn up at 8.30 am , which means I get an appointment on the day I need one. It is Nurses I see mainly and they are all very caring."
Longshore,Rural issues and getting to a GP appointment,6/6/2017,3,"As Wrentham is a 'part-time' surgery in the group, and that is the village we live in, if we are ill on the day it is not open we have to travel to Kessingland or Wangford. We do not drive and the bus service is not very regular. When we call for an appointment the receptionist can be very abrupt as we are taking a little time to try and work out if the appointment time offered works ok with the bus service. Consideration needs to be given by the surgery for patients that live in the rurals and rely on public transport."
Longshore,Same day appointments,6/22/2017,5,Appointments same day.  Easy to access
Longshore,Scheduled appointments easier,7/10/2018,4,"Ringing in on the day is always difficult and can be waiting ages, if you are feeling really unwell this is hard. Getting a scheduled appointment works well though for follow ups etc."
Longshore,Service great but...,1/23/2020,5,"The surgery itself is excellent for me.  I am however very angry as the medication I have been on for 25 years linked to my ongoing life threatening condition is no longer available. I went to pick it up in December at the Chemist and just told they cannot get it anymore.  I searched numerous places for it (Boots etc) but no luck and was told that there just is no longer a supply coming into the County. I am on an alternative but it is making me feel terribly unwell.  I am very angry about it, but there is nowhere I can go to try sort it."
Longshore,Telephone access,2/13/2019,3,It is really difficult to get appointments by calling on the telephone.  I have turned up at the door to queue but that is now starting to get longer as more people are doing it.
Longshore,Text reminders would be good,6/28/2018,4,"The surgery is very good.  They do not send text reminders which I think would help with the 'do not attends'. When you call on the day, it is usually engaged so I end up walking over to get an appointment as I can not get through when i feel it is urgent"
Longshore,Triage system needs to be explained,6/4/2019,3,"I find it unusual to be asked what is wrong with me by a non-medical member of staff. Once this was explained by a Healthwatch Suffolk CDO, it made sense as to 'why' but I prefer not to give details and information to non-medical staff."
Longshore,Very hard to get an appointment,6/4/2019,5,It's very hard to get an appointment. I find that staff can be a bit abrupt as they act as 'gate keepers' to the service.
Longshore,Very responsive,6/16/2023,4,Very responsive. I called today as had a fall and as the nurse is here today I have been brought here (I normally go to Wrentham) where they also see me very quickly when open. It is good because it means I do not have to go to hospital.
Longshore,Very satisfied with treatment,3/29/2018,5,My doctor is fairly new to the practice and I have been very satisfied with the treatment I have received.
Longshore,Waiting room could do with a few changes,6/4/2019,4,There need to be more chairs with arms on as it is difficult for many to get out of the chairs. There are only 2 in the waiting room.
Longshore,Walk in appointments are possible,6/4/2019,5,I walk in for an appointment as I'm local and I find this is the easiest way to get an appointment.
Longshore,Walk in appointments easier that phone,6/4/2019,5,"Walk in to get an appointment, it's easier than phoning up."
Longshore,Walk to surgery easier,2/13/2019,3,Just have to wait long while for appointments.  Have to walk to surgery if you want an appointment early.
Longshore,Well co-ordinated care,9/1/2020,5,They have looked after me really well.  I had a home visit when I had a Stroke in the summer (2019) and was sent straight to hospital (James Paget) and then had an operation in Norfolk and Norwich.  Everything co-ordinated well with my Physio at home and OT too
MarketCross,30 minute wait on phone,2/15/2023,4,"I called this morning and had a 30 minute wait on the phone and I was surprised I was only offered an on the day appointment, when I would've preferred to book one for later in the week.  I then had to wait for a phone call back but that came quickly and I now have an appointment.  I feel this approach is a little less personal and each time I see a different doctor.  It's not caused any specific issues and the staff have been good over the years."
MarketCross,Advanced appointment with nurse,9/26/2022,5,I've found it fine to get an advanced appointment with a nurse after the surgery booked the appointment at my last visit. The nurses are very good and the other staff are nice too. It all works very well for me.
MarketCross,All pretty good here,1/11/2018,4,All pretty good here-not quite exceptional for me by and large. But one Dr here did pick up something up that had been missed for some time at my previous practice. Access to clinicians is pretty good. I phoned in today and I am being seen today! Having to ring a bell on reception is a bit odd if the receptionist isn't at the desk. I have had to use it but didn't really enjoy disturbing the receptionist.
MarketCross,Always able to get an appointment when needed,9/18/2019,5,"The staff are very good - it can be a difficult job.
I do feel valued here and well cared for."
MarketCross,Always able to make an appointment,1/15/2019,4,"I found the triage system very good. Always able to either make an appointment, speak to a nurse or a doctor, or be seen if necessary. The receptionists are very understanding. I do question the 111 system, where there are personal questions by untrained people. Patients are often not logical when under stress, this is obvious."
MarketCross,Always been good,2/15/2023,4,The on the day system is a bit frustrating but overall the surgery is good.  The phones are busy and I've had to wait in a queue for a while but have then had a call back and appointments when they've been needed.
MarketCross,Always easy to get an appointment when needed,9/25/2019,5,"The triage system works really well so that if you need to see a doctor/nurse on the day, then you will be seen. I have had nothing but excellent experiences with this surgery. All the doctors are caring and take time to understand the problem. I never feel like I'm being rushed or the problem dismissed."
MarketCross,Amazing,1/16/2019,5,"Thank you for your care and support with a recent end-of-life resident. You really have gone above and beyond, and I am eternally grateful."
MarketCross,Appointment making is easy,9/18/2019,4,I can't think why I would need to change anything here.
MarketCross,Appointment quite easy to book,10/29/2018,5,"I am a long standing patient here but I haven't been in for a bit of a while. Historically the only issue is a slight lateness (in being called in). This is an on the day appointment, it was quite easy to book so I am well pleased."
MarketCross,Appointments quite good,2/13/2020,4,"Pleasant staff attitude, very helpful, getting an appointment is quite good."
MarketCross,Busy on the phones,10/28/2021,4,It's busy on the phones so I use econsult which is great and works really well as you can put everything relevant down and the doctors come back to you really quickly. I find the staff are really nice too.
MarketCross,Busy phones,2/2/2023,4,"It can be difficult getting through to the surgery as the phones are busy and you then have to wait for a call back from a doctor but you're not told when this is likely to happen, lately they have been during the morning. I feel that circumstances are dictating what they can actually do at the moment.  Staff have been great, caring and very thorough. Prescriptions are available when needed but I do find it hard having to come to the surgery monthly to drop off the prescription request and then come back again to pick up the medication when its ready."
MarketCross,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,"I don't need to visit the surgery often but calling the surgery this morning took 40 minutes to get through. Staff are polite and reception arranged for a call back by a nurse about an hour after I spoke to them about a non urgent issue and I've then had an appointment with a GP.  

A while back a family member had uncontrolled back pain and was unable to get in the car. After speaking to a GP they said to call 999 as there was nothing they could do and they would do an xray. We didn't feel this was right as it wasn't a 999 issue. Finally after 5 physio visits the actual issue was finally identified and he was referred to hospital. After deciding to go private for treatment it has been difficult to get the information added to the notes."
MarketCross,Can be difficult to get appointment.,9/18/2019,3,"Waiting time can be 30-45mins
Overall, apart from appointments, it is pretty good."
MarketCross,Can be quite a wait at appointment,2/13/2020,3,"Sometimes can be quite a wait at appointment, it can seem longer when you are with young children. The communication could be improved if the GP is running late. The screen at the front of the surgery does not always indicate where to sit. I think the surgery is reactive rather than proactive."
MarketCross,Can't fault anything,4/1/2019,5,"This surgery is good all around. I can't fault anything, they system (triage call back) may not work for everyone but it works very well for me. Access to appointments is good and I find the doctors and nurses first class"
MarketCross,"Caring GP's, staff very pleasant",3/16/2017,4,"The GPs are very caring.  My own GP is away at present as her mother is unwell.  I think that it is qite nice that patients are given this ""personal"" information.  The receptionists also are very pleasant.  A GP is calling me this morning"
MarketCross,Clinic nurses very good,6/28/2022,5,I've attended a pre booked appointment with the nurse today which was fine to get but I do miss the face to face appointments but so far it's worked well. There is a slight feeling that they are trying to or preferring not to see you. Most of what the surgery and staff do is excellent and they are very understanding.  The clinic nurses are very good and I like the triage process but the decision to come in or not is not a discussion its a one sided decision.  A bit more flexibility for older people would be good.
MarketCross,Concerned about GP appointments,2/2/2023,3,I've been able to get appointments with the nurses with no issues but although I haven't really tried to get a doctors appointment I would be concerned how easy it would be to get one from what I hear but appointments with the nurses are great.
MarketCross,couldn't ask for better,6/8/2016,5,I feel well looked after and I couldn't ask for better
MarketCross,Diabetic check delayed a bit,6/28/2022,5,"I've transferred to the surgery and have had my 6 month diabetic check, the first one here and it was slightly delayed but not by much. The blood test system has changed and but it seems to work being done at the Mildenhall Hub. I haven't had a lot of contact with the surgery but what I have had has been good and I've been called in by the surgery for my shingles vaccination."
MarketCross,Difficult to get through,10/28/2021,4,"It's tough, difficult to get through on the phone. I'm happy to have a phone consultation and this time it led to a face to face appointment. Love the staff and appreciate what they all do. The nurses and all the staff are good and I'm happy to see any of them."
MarketCross,Difficult to take call backs at work,9/26/2022,4,"It's a great surgery and you can get appointments, you do have to call on the day but you do get seen. The difficulty I have is being able to take calls at work as I can't always take it immediately. Because everything is being dealt with on the day it means routine issues can't be addressed without going through the process and having a call back."
MarketCross,Difficult to understand,4/1/2019,3,"I find some of the doctors difficult to understand because English is not their first language. Also some doctors cut you short when you are explaining what is wrong. Call backs from the practice can take between 2-4 hours and routine appointments take approximately two weeks. I don't live in Mildenhall itself, I live in a nearby village, so organising transport can be difficult to get to appointments. Also I have been upset by some of my interactions with clinicians."
MarketCross,Difficulties getting a medication,6/14/2016,4,My husband was given a new tablet but we couldn't get it so we called the surgery and were told that he would have to talk to a specific doctor and it would be a week before he could call back. Annual reviews do not get done or chased but they are a very busy practice. I rang yesterday for an appointment and was given one for over two weeks away.
MarketCross,Doctors all seem very competent,10/29/2018,5,I am not worried which doctor I see-they all seem very competent to me. The nurses that I have seen are also good. It isn't unusual to be called in a little late for an appointment (mostly with Drs rather than nurses) but it is never much. I see the reports on the NHS on the TV news and I recognise any of it! I don't really experience any real delays or problems here-long may it last!
MarketCross,Doctors are good and listen well.,9/18/2019,4,The doctors are very good and listen well.
MarketCross,Doctors have been good,2/13/2020,4,"Generally staff are helpful. There is an electrical light which is malfunctioning and flashing in the waiting room today, we have informed the reception staff but they are not allowed to touch it so my husband has had to move into the other waiting room as he gets migraines with flashing lights I have stayed here otherwise we wont know when he is being called in on the screen. Good hospital referrals. I am not opposed to the triage system."
MarketCross,Don't get reminders,9/24/2018,4,I don't get reminders about yearly check ups (asthma etc.). I have to make a note and remember to make an appointment myself. The appointments themselves are fine.
MarketCross,Drs are always very nice,7/19/2016,4,doctors are always very nice and they have a handy prescription service in the surgery
MarketCross,Easy to get appointment,9/11/2018,5,"I spoke to reception this morning, explained the issue and I've been given an appointment with a doctor. I prefer contacting the surgery by phone as don't use online services and I find that staff explain things very well."
MarketCross,Easy to make appointments,9/18/2019,5,"Very nice staff here, making appointments is easy here.
I would not change anything here.
Very content with the service."
MarketCross,Easy to speak to a GP,2/2/2023,4,I feel I've now worked out how best to give myself the best chance of getting through to the surgery quickly in the morning and it worked well today again.  I spoke to reception quickly and was given an appointment after discussing the issue with a doctor.  I have also used econsult which worked well but tend to call the surgery more often.
MarketCross,Econsult worked well,2/15/2023,4,The language used by reception implies that unless its urgent you can't get an appointment but you also can't get appointments ahead of time easily.  If the surgery is using an on the day system there needs to be a way to book for non urgent issues or staff need to stop asking if it's urgent otherwise if each time you call you're asked the same and if its not urgent you can't get an appointment. When working it is also very difficult taking call backs as no time is given and I can't always take the call immediately.  Econsults have worked well but it does mean there are three different online options available to use and its not overly clear when to use each one.
MarketCross,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Lady in 70's gets to see the same doctor which is important as they know her history
MarketCross,excellent,9/14/2017,5,excellent
MarketCross,excellent,9/14/2017,5,When Mum needed a home visit they came on the same day!
MarketCross,excellent,9/14/2017,5,They are very good
MarketCross,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Good
MarketCross,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,My doctor is happy to spend time with me in the appt.  It may mean I'm late going in and others are given the extra time but I'd prefer that
MarketCross,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,we think our local GP service is excellent as is West SuffolkHospital
MarketCross,Excellent and attentive staff.,8/14/2017,5,Staff and GP's always very attentive.  I don't mind if I have to wait as I know the doctor will not rush me
MarketCross,Excellent nurse,6/28/2022,5,"I called this morning and had a call back from a doctor who was very polite, they arranged an appointment for me.  The nurse has been excellent when I've seen her. The reception staff are all very friendly and understanding and really accommodating when I moved to the area and needed to arrange my third covid booster. I couldn't ask for any more."
MarketCross,Excellent patient centre GP,9/14/2017,5,"Very patient centred GP visit, very warm and friendly.  Discussed situation with resident and ensured understanding and patient involvement.  Visit was during an appropriate time for resident"
MarketCross,Excellent service,2/13/2020,5,"I have had some excellent service, the staff are very helpful. I do like my GP."
MarketCross,Excellent service,6/18/2016,5,They provide an excellent service. I can't fault any aspect of my care-it is all exemplary
MarketCross,Extremely helpful,7/15/2019,5,"We had an incident on suite , a GP from Market Cross came very quickly and assisted us. Fantastic response, very helpful and we managed the situation with the help of the GP."
MarketCross,Extremely Respectful,8/1/2018,5,"The Dr visited two of our residents and was extremely respectful to our residents, calling them by their full names and communicating in a very caring and understanding tone at all times."
MarketCross,fair,6/21/2016,3,very good
MarketCross,Feels like there are barriers,6/28/2022,4,"Its a bit difficult to get appointments it feels like they don't really want to see you so put barriers up such as the call backs. Its a good practice I just don't like the processes in place. Its difficult to get an in person appointment but once you do see staff they are all very good. I called this morning, I spoke to a GP and I'm now seeing them. It's the questioning about whether you really need to see a doctor which is off putting. It was better before covid."
MarketCross,Find e-consult difficult,9/26/2022,4,I find getting through on the phone off-putting but find completing an e-consult difficult too as it's hard to put all the issues down on the form as they don't seem to be relevant. I'm not sure what to do.
MarketCross,First appointment,2/2/2023,4,I'm a relatively new patient and this is my first appointment for an annual check up. Because I was invited in for the appointment it was easy to arrange and the staff were very helpful.
MarketCross,First appointment was very straightforward,1/11/2018,5,"I moved to Mildenhall from Newmarket fairly recently and my previous GP (and friends locally) suggested that I register here. Registration was very straightforward. This has been my first clinical visit here. I made the appointment by phone-very straightforward. I was seen ten minutes early. Nurse gave me the injection and she was excellent. So far so good, in fact so far excellent."
MarketCross,Friendly and helpful staff,2/13/2020,5,Very friendly and helpful staff. Could do with another doctor as it might be easier to get an appointment.
MarketCross,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,4,I got a quick call back this morning from a nurse and was then given an appointment with a doctor. I had three issues and all have been sorted this morning. The staff are very friendly and the surgery works well for me.
MarketCross,Friendly staff,10/28/2021,4,There are no real problems at all. Staff are all very friendly and I use both econsult and call to get appointments depending on the situation. I think you're doing a good job.
MarketCross,Generally good,11/21/2022,5,Get good responses to any requests and they've been good at supporting me when I've been upset. The surgery works well and there are no areas that need to improve.
MarketCross,good,7/3/2019,4,They look after me reasonably well.  Getting an appointment is a pain
MarketCross,Good but have to wait for appointment,4/5/2017,4,"The surgery is always busy and often have to wait.  However, I do not mind waiting for a reasonable time as I know that I won't be rushed."
MarketCross,GP's always helpful,6/4/2019,5,"The GP's are always helpful. Waiting to get an appointment is quite good, although the wait in the surgery is often quite long, however I feel that's because the doctors are thorough. I prefer to wait and not feel rushed in the appointment."
MarketCross,"GPs are amazing, they really do care.",9/18/2019,4,"Doctors are amazing they really do care.
It is a busy surgery and it can be a long wait to get an appointment if it's non urgent.
I like the fact that they do minor surgery."
MarketCross,Great,6/19/2023,5,"I've had no issues getting an appointment today I called at 8am and being seen mid morning so can't fault the service, it all works very well."
MarketCross,Great surgery,2/2/2023,5,I spoke to reception this morning and was given an appointment straightaway. The staff were friendly and helpful and have always been good.  When I've needed them the referrals have been done quickly and my GP has been wonderful. They've been so thorough and have lined up appointments to make things easier for me.
MarketCross,Great surgery,11/25/2021,5,Even through Covid times which have been very difficult for everything the team have tried their very best. I needed an appointment and got a call back the same day and appointment the next.
MarketCross,Happy with surgery,10/28/2021,5,"I'm happy with the surgery, it's easy to get appointments when they're needed and the staff are friendly. I spoke to the GP this morning and they said to come in, it's worked well."
MarketCross,Happy with surgery. Getting appointment is OK,9/18/2019,5,"Getting an appointment here is OK.
More than happy with this surgery, no changes needed for me or my family."
MarketCross,Hard to get appointments,7/19/2016,2,Hard to get appointments within a reasonable time.  It seems most of the doctors here are part-time
MarketCross,He is brilliant,10/29/2018,5,"Only on one occasion was I not treated with dignity and respect at reception. This was a one off. I am so, so satisfied with my doctor who I always see. He spends as much time as is needed with each patient which means he is often running late but I am happy to wait. Plus he is brilliant in the consulting room."
MarketCross,Hearing test machine,2/13/2020,4,They are waiting for a hearing test machine to arrive at the surgery before I can get my ears tested.
MarketCross,How good is that???,10/29/2018,5,I phoned in this morning and a nurse called me back within 20 mins. I discussed my issues with her and she told me I needed an appointment. I was seen at 10.10-collected my medication from dispensary (I live more than a mile away) and i will be out before 10.30. How good is that??
MarketCross,I can make an appointment as I need one,9/18/2019,5,"I can make an appointment as I need to which is important to me.
I find the staff most helpful and also the GP.
I am very happy with this surgery."
MarketCross,I have only had good experiences,7/11/2018,5,"This is a rural practice and I have previous experience of a large urban practice. They are like chalk and cheese! This is a very personal place, I have only had good experiences. I can get a routine appointment with my favourite clinician within a couple of weeks. On the day consultations/appointments are available for emergencies. I have always thought my consultations have been thorough and the advice/treatment reassuring."
MarketCross,I like the GP call back,2/13/2020,5,"Very accommodating, find it easy to get appointments, I missed my appointment yesterday and they got me straight in today instead. Very good and helpful. I do like the call back from the GP or triage nurse, very good."
MarketCross,I think to myself how lucky I am,4/1/2019,5,I understand how difficult it is for nurses and doctors to run to time. I don't mind waiting but I have noticed that nurses tend to be more timely than doctors. I have been a patient here for some years and I sometimes think how lucky I am when I hear some of the experiences of friends in other places. I know my doctor (who I see regularly) and I value that.
MarketCross,Impressed with the doctors,2/13/2020,5,"I have been impressed with the doctors here, I have been referred to the hospital in a timely way previously. I would like to see a Saturday morning service."
MarketCross,It is a really good practice.,1/11/2018,5,"I've been a patient for here for some years and it is a really good practice. I've never had a bad experience here-they are always friendly. Always polite, always professional. All of the doctors that I have seen have been thorough and reassuring. Building is a bit 'warren' like but other than that I can't think of anything that I would like to see changed."
MarketCross,It is always good,4/1/2019,5,I don't come often but when I or any member of my family do come it is always good. I was prescribed tablets and told to come back it the problem didn't go away. It didn't so I 'phoned at 8.30 this morning and I got an appointment for 10.00. It surely doesn't get much better that that.
MarketCross,I've been a patient for 76 years!,4/1/2019,5,"I have been a patient here for 76 years, since I was born!! I am often late being called in but getting an appointment isn't a difficulty. The surgery suits my wife and I very well. We did have small hiccup when the repeat prescription changed. We used to just collect meds. from pharmacy but now we have to tick the boxes on the form and drop it in to the surgery and then collect from pharmacy a few days later. Now we are used to the process it is ok though."
MarketCross,Less personal,9/26/2022,4,"I do feel that the system in place now is less personal with the introduction of online services but the care and treatment has been great and the doctor I've been seeing has been wonderful, so supportive."
MarketCross,Like seeing the same GP,10/28/2021,4,"I can get through ok and can speak to my GP. I do like that I'm able to see the same GP as it helps with the issues I have. It would be a good if you were able to get test results online, would make it a lot easier."
MarketCross,Like to know where in the phone queue,6/28/2022,4,Takes a while to get through in the morning but appointments are available and you get to see the most appropriate clinician. It helps to know where you are in the phone queue and staff are very nice and helpful.
MarketCross,Long wait for appt after hospital discharge,9/18/2019,3,"Had to wait 2 weeks to get appointment following a hospital discharge.
Younger GPs are more willing to look into other things.
The waiting room is often heaving (full)."
MarketCross,Lovely,9/26/2022,5,"Lovely, no problems with the surgery, the staff are very helpful and I've been able to get appointments. My husband has needed home visits and whenever we call they are great and come out to him."
MarketCross,Making appointment is very straightforward,9/18/2019,5,"The nurse is fantastic, very helpful."
MarketCross,Mostly nurse appointments,9/30/2022,2,I don't feel that you can get to see a doctor face to face very easily but I've mostly had appointments with the nurse or been referred to physio. I've been sent to physio three times for the same issue and nothing improves and nothing else ever results or changes.
MarketCross,Never had an issue,10/28/2021,4,Can be very busy on the phone but you do get through and are offered a call back and then an appointment if needed. Staff are very pleasant and nothing needs to change at the practice.
MarketCross,Never had issues,10/28/2021,4,"I've never had issues getting appointments, including face to face. The staff here are good, they are working under such challenging circumstances."
MarketCross,New phone system is better,1/2/2022,4,"I like the new phone system that is in place, it's a shorter message and I like knowing where I am in the queue. I haven't seen a GP in a long time, although I have seen nurses. My annual reviews haven't taken place as regularly as they previously did. Generally the communication between me and the doctor has been good but it does concern me that getting a face to face appointment with a GP is more difficult."
MarketCross,No problems,9/13/2018,5,In the few times I've been I have had no problems getting an appointment.
MarketCross,No Wheelchair Access,10/31/2017,1,No access for wheelchair.  Our patient needs to attend the surgery to get her ears syringed but her large electric wheelchair will not fit through the door.  I have asked if a nurse can come here to do it or if we could utilise a room at the local health clinic.  Apparently the surgery nurses are not insured elsewhere.
MarketCross,Not always easy to get an appointment,6/14/2016,4,"Getting appointments is not always easy and you can wait a week to 10 days to see a doctor, to see my doctor is longer. The surgery works well for me and nothing needs changing. It's local which is very important."
MarketCross,Not easy to get the same GP,2/13/2020,5,Its a good surgery but it is not that easy to get a appointment with the same doctor which I prefer. Would be good to have a text or an email reminder of details of appointment.
MarketCross,Nothing is too much trouble for staff here,9/18/2019,5,If I need extra time they allow for this without making me feel guilty. I find appointment making here flexible and quite straight forward. I an book appointments ahead. I can get consistency of GP if needed.
MarketCross,Offered different appointment options,10/28/2021,5,It can take some time to get through in the morning on the phone but when you do I've been offered phone calls back and face to face appointments depending on the situation which is great. The majority of staff are good too.
MarketCross,Outstanding,7/1/2019,4,"We always see the same doctor, that makes getting an appointment a bit more difficult but we would prefer to wait. Obviously if any of us was quite poorly we would take any doctor for an emergency appointment. Otherwise everything is outstanding. We have both (husband and wife) only ever been patients here and it has always been good."
MarketCross,"Overall very, very good.",1/11/2018,4,"I can be up to 30 mins late being called in, this would be with a doctor, nurses are generally better in this regard. On the day access to appointments is good but routine appointments can be up to two weeks in the future. On the plus side I can see the same doctor every time-overall it is all very, very good."
MarketCross,Parking issues,7/19/2016,1,complaint about parking at this surgery being bad
MarketCross,Phone calls have worked,10/28/2021,4,"It can be a bit difficult to get through on the phone but you do get to speak to someone and on the whole the call backs have worked out well and have addressed the issues with out the need to visit the surgery. Staff are good, I do find that I sometime forget to ask all the questions I have when I'm on the phone with the GP though but otherwise it works well."
MarketCross,Phone lines busy,10/28/2021,4,"The phone lines are busy in the morning but the doctor really cares and I have a great relationship with them. I try to see the same GP if possible as it helps with continuity and they understand my conditions. The staff do their best and I don't feel anything needs to improve, it always works well."
MarketCross,Phones are busy in the morning,1/2/2022,4,"When calling the surgery in the morning the phones are quite busy and it can be a bit of a wait to get through to reception but not sure you can do much about it if it is that busy. I do worry that it is more difficult to speak to a doctor quickly, I would've liked to see a GP today but I have a nurse appointment. Its worrying how many patients are trying to access the surgery."
MarketCross,Pleased with the surgery,7/3/2019,5,Appointments and calls happen quickly and it's great that you can be booked an appointment with a GP by reception with no triage or call back required.  I've found that the surgery works well and the staff are very good at explaining issues.
MarketCross,Poor,5/1/2017,2,Although there are often long waits I know it is because the doctors do not rush people and I know I won't be rushed either
MarketCross,Poor,9/30/2019,2,There are a very limited number of advance appointments.  I wish there would be a shorter waiting time to get appointments.
MarketCross,Poor prescription timing,10/31/2017,1,Service user kept waiting 24 hours for prescription for antibiotics. Patient seen on 12-09-17.  Deemed to to have a chest infection.  We usually collect the prescription later the same day; we visited the surgery and phoned but the script wasn't ready.  We tried again the following morning and finally we were able to collect it at 3 pm.  I realise doctors are very busy but this was a delay of more than 24 hours
MarketCross,Pretty good,6/28/2022,4,"A little bit of a delay to get appointments with a nurse and the phones are very busy  but overall it's a pretty good surgery with friendly, approachable staff."
MarketCross,Pretty good on the whole,2/13/2020,4,"Pretty good service on the whole, you do have to wait a week or 2 but if its desperate they will see you quickly."
MarketCross,Pretty good surgery,9/24/2018,4,This is a pretty good surgery. They are very busy these days but seem to be able to take it in their stride.
MarketCross,Professional and kind doctors,1/17/2022,4,"It is often very difficult to get through on the phone to request a call/appointment, but I have always been seen by or spoken to a Dr the same day when I have needed it. They also have an econsult online service for non-urgent problems, where you can request advice, treatment, referrals etc and a Dr will get back to you via email or phone. I have found this very useful and have always had a response within the timeframe they give. The Drs and nurses are all very informative, patient and happy to answer all your questions. 
The current covid setup for collecting prescriptions from the in-surgery dispensary does not work very well, you are often left sitting in the waiting room with no idea if it is your turn to go to the dispensary or not."
MarketCross,Professional and kind manner,2/5/2019,4,"GP was professional, kind and efficient. GP returned call regarding residents and their conditions. Dealt with every problem raised and ensured that residents received appropriate help/medication/documentation was done. Professional and kind."
MarketCross,Quick call back,9/26/2022,5,"I called the surgery first thing and didn't have to wait long to be dealt with. I was called back by a GP within the hour and have been given an appointment straight away, so it's been a good experience."
MarketCross,Really good,2/2/2023,5,Been able to get on the day appointments and its easy to do. I've been very impressed by the way the surgery has made reasonable adjustments for me.  I spoke to my GP and they quickly put the changes in place to make it easier.  The surgery have been really great and I feel everything works very well.
MarketCross,Really good,9/26/2022,4,Today has been really good. I had a quick thorough call back which was followed by an appointment so I'm very happy. Anything urgent gets dealt with the same day. In the past waiting times in the surgery have been quite long and it would be helpful if staff could advise you of delays when you check in. Staff are very professional and are particularly good with children.
MarketCross,Reception staff (first point of contact) rude,6/8/2020,2,"Reception staff rude, nurse was patronising and didn't listen to me."
MarketCross,Receptionists are very good.,1/11/2018,5,I have given a low score on cleanliness (see below) but that is solely based on a dirty toilet today-everything else has always been spot on. The surgeries can sometimes run a bit late but never in my experience excessively so. I have been in to the surgery twice this week and that is very unusual for me. The first time I was called in following a discussion with the triage nurse and then subsequently a call from a doctor. I was then called in for an appointment after discussing my condition. Today I have been called in following a fall from my bike and again I was given an appointment. My experience has been that the receptionists are really good and that the doctors and nurses are great!
MarketCross,Receptionists smile!,12/12/2018,5,I moved to Mildenhall from Essex and I transferred to the Market Cross surgery. I don't need to go often but when I do I can't believe how much better (than previous surgery in Essex) it is.I can get to see a GP when I need to. They listen attentively then diagnose very professionally and the receptionists smile! A wholly new and pleasant experience.
MarketCross,Reliable and Responsive,8/1/2018,5,"Market Cross have provided a very consistent service. They are always responsive, reliable and helpful. All of the GPs that see residents at the lodge treat the residents with care and compassion and are very keen to communicate with family members. I have not yet had a negative experience working with market cross."
MarketCross,Ring for a prescription,6/8/2016,4,I have COPD (an ongoing condition) and when I need antibiotics I can ring the surgery and they will make a prescription available to me.
MarketCross,Same day appointments and GP consistency,9/18/2019,4,"Same day appointments easily obtained and often get consistency of the same GP.
More than happy with this surgery.
No changes needed."
MarketCross,Seems ok,10/28/2021,4,Everything seems to be ok at the moment. I don't have regular appointments but when I've needed one its been fine. You do have to wait a little longer for prescriptions now but they are ready to collect when they say they will be. I'm going to call later to arrange my flu jab appointment as the supply has been late so I couldn't have it on the original date.
MarketCross,Seems to be efficient,2/13/2020,3,"Seems to be an efficient surgery, I like the triage system, there is about a 3 week wait if its classed as a non urgent issue. Staff are helpful and pleasant."
MarketCross,Seen quickly,6/28/2022,5,I called first thing this morning and spoke to a GP who has given me an appointment to come and see them. I like to try to see the same GP if possible as I feel it improves the care I get. I've used econsult but its a bit slow to get a response (towards the end of the timeframe stated) but it has worked quite well.
MarketCross,"Sensible, practical, available",1/17/2022,5,"The GPs and staff at Market Cross have never let my family down. Most recently my younger daughter was in a major mental health crisis and their resident GP with a special interest in mental health was there for her, gave her a double length appointment via telephone (this is relevant as she greatly preferred this to F2F!) and talked through all the options with her. She has since been on medication, which has transformed her mental health, allowed her to go to university and thrive there."
MarketCross,Service over 45 years has been excellent,7/4/2016,5,"Service over 45 years has been excellent. You're seen on time, most of the time. However, making a non emergency appointment to see a doctor takes too long-a week to a fortnight."
MarketCross,Staff always polite and courteous.,9/18/2019,5,"I find the staff always to be polite and courteous, which is important to me.
I have never had any problems."
MarketCross,Staff are good,10/28/2021,4,"Surgery is absolutely fine. The phone system works well and its been great to talk to the GP on the phone, it's enabled the issues to be sorted and quickly. Staff are also good. The only slight issue is with the dispensary, where I've been told a date that the medication will be ready but they could've been picked up sooner as the date on the label is days before and considering I'd run out it would have been good to have them sooner."
MarketCross,Staff helpful,6/28/2022,5,"A lot better now, its relaxed a bit. I phoned for an appointment and the reception staff are good. The triage call back by the GP is quite quick which is good. I like to see my named GP if possible as it helps with continuity as he knows my history. Today I've had a prebooked appointment with the nurse and I feel that it is getting back to normal a bit more now with face to face appointments and also coming in to the surgery without having to be let in by staff."
MarketCross,Staff nice and friendly,10/28/2021,3,"The staff are nice and friendly but I do feel that there is the potential to slip through the gaps when regular checks aren't happening, I've not had the regular checks I would've had normally and I've not had a medication review for a long time. It is really hard to get through on the phone but once you are its quite good."
MarketCross,Staff very good,2/13/2020,4,"Staff are always very helpful you can talk to them. The doctor was wonderful and was an excellent listener. Booking appointments is easy, for more routine things it can take 3-4 weeks but if its is urgent they can fit you in on the day."
MarketCross,Suits me very well,10/29/2018,5,"I have been a patient here between 3 and 4 years now. It suits me very well. A slight lack of timeliness is the only blip! The best thing about the practice is the ease of access, particularly to appointments. In my experience the doctors and nurses themselves are very good."
MarketCross,Surgery is good,10/28/2021,4,"There are no issues at the surgery, it's all good. E consult works well, I had a chat with the doctor and now have a face to face appointment. When working it can be difficult to take a call back which is a little bit of an issue but I'm not sure how it could change really."
MarketCross,Surgery works well,6/14/2016,5,Most of the time I get to see the same doctor and when I call for an appointment I'll get one the same week. The surgery works well from my point of view.
MarketCross,The tannoy system is not clear enough,2/13/2020,5,"The tannoy speaker system is not clear enough as it could be especially if you have a hearing impairment, as you can't always position yourself to see the screen. A very good surgery otherwise."
MarketCross,They are very caring,9/24/2018,5,They are very caring. It seems to be a very well run surgery. Staff are pleasant and the wait to go in isn't excessive. I think the doctors and nurses are first class!
MarketCross,They deal with issues quickly,2/13/2020,5,"If you have an issue they do see you quickly, staff are very helpful. Honestly I cannot fault them here. They have looked after me recently when I was very poorly and they showed me great dignity."
MarketCross,They don't ring back,7/19/2016,1,The setup where you ring in and they ring back can be unreliable; sometimes they don't ring back.  If you want to specifically see your own doctor sometimes there is a 3 - 4 week wait for an appointment.
MarketCross,They have been marvellous,6/8/2018,5,They (market Cross surgery) have been marvellous-I can't find any fault at all with their service
MarketCross,To see a specific doctor can take time,6/14/2016,3,"If you want to see a specific doctor you can wait two weeks to see them. Generally quite a good service, the receptionist are very nice as are most staff."
MarketCross,Too many patients,6/15/2016,2,"Too many patients. The attitude of staff can be off too. Doctors are good at explaining issues and the quality of care does change a bit , mainly due to them being so busy that they can't dedicate time to you. To get an appointment you have to wait 2 weeks to see any doctor but in an urgent situation they do offer a sit and wait option."
MarketCross,Triage system not great,6/15/2016,4,Getting through on the phone to make an appointment can take a long while. The triage system where by you are assessed on your need for an appointment before coming in to the surgery is not great.
MarketCross,Triage system works well,1/2/2022,5,"I have no particular issues getting appointments, the triage system works well and by talking to the doctor things get sorted out.  Staff look at you as a whole and will always check if anything is wrong when you see them, they're very friendly.  I'm happy with everything, if you need to be seen they will see you once you've spoken to them."
MarketCross,Triage worked well,6/7/2022,4,I've been through the triage process and it worked well. The staff are all fine and I like knowing where in the queue you are when calling the surgery. My father in particular finds the long phone message overwhelming and it is putting him off from calling the surgery himself.
MarketCross,Very caring,8/1/2019,5,"Very caring, took time during a very busy working day to spend a lot of time with a relative, and with staff."
MarketCross,Very difficult,6/28/2022,1,"I've found it very difficult to get a face to face appointment, they seem very keen to diagnose over the phone but this has resulted in multiple calls to the practice as its not improving. No continuity also means that I'm passed from doctor to doctor and they all try something different, a diagnosis has then been delayed.  My recent experience hasn't been good and although care is good when you do see someone the process is flawed."
MarketCross,Very good,9/13/2022,5,A friendly surgery and has been perfect this morning. I spoke to reception who were very helpful and got an appointment easily with a GP. Nothing needs to change it all works well. I rarely come to the surgery and I've been very pleased with everything this morning.
MarketCross,Very good,9/13/2022,5,Very good to contact the surgery by phone and able to get appointments with the most suitable clinician. The staff are very pleasant and I've been able to pre book an appointment with the nurse with no problems.
MarketCross,Very good attention,7/4/2016,5,"I had a problem with my heart, everything was done very quickly. I got very good attention, they are lovely people.Still going strong at 83!"
MarketCross,Very good service,10/29/2018,4,I rang this morning and I am being seen today-very good service.The receptionist excel at bumping you up to the top of the list if you need it. I wouldn't change much about the practice but I do find the questions from the reception staff when I ring in to be intrusive but I guess that is how they know to put you up the list.
MarketCross,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"Very good surgery, very friendly. Extremely knowledgeable and they are great with patients. They listen and then finds the right solutions. Generally a good surgery and I haven't had any problems with appointments. The best surgery I've been registered with."
MarketCross,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"They are a very good surgery, I always get an appointment when I need one. You don't have much contact with reception staff anymore its all automated."
MarketCross,Very helpful,7/11/2018,4,I was dealt with by a triage nurse and I have to say she was very helpful
MarketCross,Very impressed with communication,9/18/2019,5,"I'm really impressed with communication.
I am a patient who has had lung and bowel cancer, and this surgery is able to support me.
I only wish they could do my blood tests here."
MarketCross,Very quick this morning,6/28/2022,4,To get through on the phone this morning was very quick but normally its taken longer. I find it very difficult to take calls at work so the triage process isn't great for me when no time is given for the call back. In the past I have called the surgery to be told there were no appointments left and to call the next day when the same thing happens again.
MarketCross,Very responsive to need,1/11/2018,4,"I have been a patient for 40 years-treatment options have increased and things are now so much better. The doctors do try to give me time. That's the best part, they are very responsive to need. Referrals are speedy. There isn't a downside in my experience. Doctors do ask  'is there anything else' at the end of a consultation, not every time but it is good. The triage system works well which results in quick appointments."
MarketCross,Waiting for triage call is difficult,1/2/2022,4,"The phones are busy, took 1/2hr to get through for this appointment. I do find waiting for the triage call difficult as I have the school run and you're never sure when they'll call.  The actual treatment and care received has been very good. The doctor I've been seeing has been very thorough and the nurses are amazing."
MarketCross,Well supported,1/2/2022,4,"I've felt very well supported recently by the staff, they must be under incredible pressure. I've been called in for a diabetic check and I find the systems in place here work well for me and my family."
MarketCross,Works very well for me,4/1/2019,5,"It always works very well for me when I need to come in which thankfully isn't very often. I can get seen when I need to be and in my experience all the doctors and nurses are friendly and professional. The only small thing is that I sometimes have to wait 10-15 minutes after my appointment time to be seen. I understand that there will be a new 'Hub' in Mildenhall at some point, I do hope the surgery will stay in it's current premises as I would find it quite difficult to get to the proposed new 'Hub' site."
MarketCross,Works well,7/13/2023,5,I spoke to reception and was given an appointment with a GP so I've found the process works well when I do need to use it. Staff have always been great and are good at talking issues through.
MarketCross,Would like communication if GP running late,9/18/2019,4,"If GP running late it would be useful to communicate this with me in waiting room.
I do find that the staff can be a bit sharp when you ask.
I like the triage system. Happy with the surgery overall."
MarketCross,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Perfect other than wait for apt and wait in waiting room.  Wait 2 -3 weeks for apt and 30 minutes wait in waiting room
Martlesham,3 Week wait,9/14/2018,4,"I had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment, that I considered much more urgent than that."
Martlesham,4 star,6/10/2015,4,Very good service and friendly staff
Martlesham,A bit rushed today,1/2/2019,4,"The appointment was 15 minutes late which is fine, but I felt slightly rushed in the appointment so that I forgot to mention everything."
Martlesham,Abrupt staff,1/2/2019,4,"Getting an appointment that is an emergency is good although waiting fro a normal appointment can be very lengthy.
I find the reception team abrupt. There are ways of saying 'there are no appointments' but when on the telephone a short sharp statement is very abrupt."
Martlesham,Access to Ulcer clinic,1/31/2019,4,"You need to be able to push for certain things. We used to have an issue with accessing a dedicated 'Leg Ulcer' service.  Originally we were sent by the surgery to Framfield as the surgery was unsure if they did 'buy in' to this service.  We have now managed to see one particular nurse who treats it, but wonder how other elderly people access this.  We went from one nurse to the other for a while as they had 'differences of opinion' about the treatment.  Now we see the same nurse it is really good and she books us in regularly with her, so she knows where we are at with the treatment.  We did feel that we had to push for this service and some people may not know about it."
Martlesham,Always get a good service,12/11/2019,5,"I have always had a good service here.  Can be a bit longer for waiting to get through than I'd like, but you do eventually and see someone on the day."
Martlesham,Always helpful,10/15/2021,5,"Practices should be congratulated on the way they're handling this awful Covid situation, not vilified by the press and public.  Telephone appointments are great for many things and should be continued please."
Martlesham,Always helpful,7/10/2020,5,"Excellent doctors, nurses and staff.  First class treatment"
Martlesham,Always helpful,7/10/2020,4,"They are always helpful.  When I need 'on the day' appointment, I do get given one.
One thing that needs improving, but not easy to fix is the need for more GP's which I know is not just here."
Martlesham,always helpful and polite.. and always smilin,6/26/2020,5,"always have good experiences here, staff friendly and always try to get you an appointment"
Martlesham,Always helpful even on busy days,6/25/2021,4,Have gone out of their way more than once to accomodate us
Martlesham,appointment not available,8/23/2021,1,"Have to call in at 8 am every morning, 35th caller on line, 45 min wait , just to be told no appointments, call back tomorrow, appalling !"
Martlesham,Appointment running late today,1/2/2019,4,Things are running quite late today to see the nurse for help with smoking. I did not even know they did that here.  My GP referred me to her and it took very little time to get my first appointment.
Martlesham,Ask My GP is working well,9/23/2022,4,"Recently had to use service for myself, my elderly mother, our adult son who I care for and my husband. Informing updates and feedback, planning treatments upon results, changing medication and referring to mental health. Responses often telephoned promptly, agree plan, instructions passed on. Polite and efficient. So grateful"
Martlesham,Awful experiences - I DO NOT Recommend.,5/13/2015,1,"I have had so many problems with this surgery I don't know where to start. From the miserable, rude reception staff, that seem to have been trained in how to be unhelpful. To a doctor who didn't even bother to ask me, a patient seeing them for the very first time regarding my ongoing mental health problems, how I had been feeling. In fact, my first appointment at this surgery lasted 2 minutes at the absolute maximum. 

The doctor was desperate to get me out the office as quickly as possible, didn't ask me a single question about my mind state since I had last seen a doctor. In fact, I can't recall the doctor asking me a single question and this was MY FIRST EVER APPOINTMENT WITH THIS SURGERY. The doctor was clearly not interested in listening to me so I gave up trying to speak, left the surgery and cried at the lack of care I had been shown. 

I even went back and saw this doctor again, despite my better judgement, in case I caught them on an off day. This time I saw them about a completely different issue and I was still just as upset as the previous visit. I was not listened to at all; I was constantly cut off by interrupting me so I did not get to say everything I wanted to. Then worse of all the doctor prescribed me UNNECESSARY antibiotics, ""just in case you have an infection"" were the doctors exact words, because clearly they couldn't be bothered to conduct an actual physical exam to find out if I did or not. I would not recommend this surgery to anyone."
Martlesham,Booking system does not cater for employed,8/8/2021,2,"Booking system is outdated and does not function for people who work full time.  

In order to book an appointment it is necessary to call at precisely 8:00 to get any chance of getting an appointment that day. It is not possible to request an appointment for a following day or even at a specific time. With an office based in Norfolk this is not helpful! Once past the seemingly unhelpful receptionist you can expect to wait up to 4 hours for a call from the GP before if deemed necessary you will be asked to come into the surgery. 

Once at the surgery the service was amazing, however it took me 3 days to book an appointment which is not acceptable for what was described to me as a critical health issue which should be dealt with urgently following the consultation. Why is there no online booking system or any flexibility?"

Martlesham,Came here for consistency of GP,7/3/2019,5,"We moved here about a year ago from another local surgery. The system here works well for us.
We can get appointments within reasonable time and see the same GP most of the time, which I like as I have ongoing health conditions."
Martlesham,Can't log in to this new service,4/17/2022,1,Tried to log in this afternoon but was unable to do so using the details of the previous system. Could someone tell me how to contact the surgery to look at my records using this new system. An email to existing patients with instructions would have been helpful.... So frustrating.
Martlesham,Caring,6/14/2016,5,"Very caring reception and doctors, would love a little more explanation of problems (ailments)."
Martlesham,Concerned about continued access to service,7/15/2019,5,"It has taken 3 weeks for a routine appointment.
Takes a long time to get through on the telephone but sometimes I walk in,
Concerned about the housing situation here, and the pressure this will bring to the surgery."
Martlesham,Difficult getting appointments,7/12/2018,3,"It is getting more and more difficult to get an appointment.  Phones are engaged for ages in the morning, then all fully booked once you get through."
Martlesham,Difficult to get an appointment.,8/30/2018,3,"Difficult to get an appointment at the surgery but when one wasn't available I was, some what reluctantly, given a GP+ appointment"
Martlesham,Do not see GP anymore,7/12/2018,3,"Do not really get to see a GP anymore here. Nurses are good at what they do but I have more confidence in seeing a GP. Difficult to get a GP appointment at all, so have to 'settle' for a nurse otherwise you see no one at all."
Martlesham,Doing their best,2/11/2022,3,"I have recently used the online system and things were resolved with a text to me on that occasion. The surgery are doing their best and trying their utmost. I feel service is very restricted now and everyone is doing their best but as a patient you want a GP, a regular GP. One GP here I feel works so hard and still is someone with the GP values. Just difficult to see them!"
Martlesham,Easy to get an appointment,10/3/2022,5,"I found it very easy to get an appointment using the new online service. I submitted a form at 8am, called by 11am and seen at 4pm as that was convenient for me by a lovey nurse practitioner. I am really impressed!"
Martlesham,Emergency is ok,8/3/2019,4,"Wait for a routine appointment is quite long, but generally you can get one on the day if an emergency.  Staff are pleasant to talk to."
Martlesham,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,I have not needed to use the surgery very often but when I do I can always get an appointment
Martlesham,Excellent,8/14/2017,5,Good system for repeat prescriptions.  Yearly health check.
Martlesham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"A wonderful surgery, went above and beyond for our family at a very difficult time."
Martlesham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,If very hot no windows or air conditioning
Martlesham,excellent - always courteous,6/14/2016,5,always courteous and helpful
Martlesham,Friendly staff,6/1/2017,4,A very good surgery in my experience. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable
Martlesham,good,7/3/2019,4,Difficult to get an appointment sometimes
Martlesham,good,7/3/2019,4,Overall the service is very good - only 2.5 doctors to look after us all.
Martlesham,good,7/3/2019,4,Good service
Martlesham,Good and can always get an appointment,9/14/2017,4,Find this surgery really good and can always get appointment when need one
Martlesham,Good surgery however...,1/2/2019,5,"We had the experience whereby we were left with no choice but to call 999.  After ringing the GP surgery and told that a home visit could not be made, we then called 111, who said we had to call our surgery.  As they could not get out to us we were told we had to call 999 by the service.
We felt terrible about this and it is no one's fault, but it needs to be made known that this is what can happen when there is not the capacity,  I do not blame the surgery at all."
Martlesham,Good to know why if delay,9/14/2018,5,"If there is a delay due to an emergency, it would be good if reception told people, so there is an understanding"
Martlesham,GP and Nursing staff are excellent.,4/11/2020,4,"I find the reception staff a bit daunting, barely making eye contact, and monosyllabic.  I know they are busy but they are the face of the practice.  Eye contact, a smile, and talking to the PERSON not a screen would make a HUGE difference."
Martlesham,Great service.,8/1/2019,5,Top class service
Martlesham,Great Support,9/14/2018,5,As a carer for my husband I have found the surgery really supportive.  I take more responsibility ensuring his blood tests for Warfarin are booked in time.It can be difficult to keep on top of but I manage.
Martlesham,Helpful and professional staff,6/5/2021,5,"My family and I have been with this surgery for over 35 years, We have always had very good service. We consider ourselves to be very fortunate."
Martlesham,I always receive excellent care,7/7/2019,5,I have seen two of the doctors here and the nurse practitioner during the past year. I trust their advice and appreciate their care. I know they operate under pressure and am grateful we have this good service provided in our village. I have never been turned away if my call is urgent and I'm happy to wait if it isn't. I also like using the on0line booking system if I don't need an urgent appointment. I didn't give 5 stars to staff attitude only because I think one of the reception staff can appear abrupt or defensive - they probably doesn't mean to. The others are fine.
Martlesham,Improved but new housing brings pressure,7/15/2019,4,"Things seemed to have improved, but I am concerned that the capacity will be an issue when all the houses are filled in the area."
Martlesham,Long enough appointments,5/31/2016,4,"Long enough appointments, helpful receptionists. Drs very brief though in describing and diagnosing."
Martlesham,Lots of appointments needed in one week,8/27/2021,5,"All staff were extremely kind, knowledgeable and helpful - bent over backwards to see me in my 'hour of need'. Can't thank you all enough."
Martlesham,Lovely and friendly Dr & nurse,9/26/2018,5,I have given a low score (3 stars) for staff attitude. I should clarify that the the doctors and nurses are lovely but receptionists are not easy to talk to.
Martlesham,Lovely surgery,7/10/2023,5,"I moved to this surgery having had issues at a different local surgery.
It's much better here.
I get to see a GP much more consistently than before and getting an appointment is much easier.
The receptionists here are very happy to help."
Martlesham,Medication wrong from Nurse,9/14/2018,3,"We have been to see the nurse twice and both times we have had to see the GP a couple of weeks later only to be told to stop taking what she had prescribed. We have lost confidence and feel insistent that we see the GP from the start now.
On occasion that I was prescribed statins I felt they were actually pushed onto me. 2 Weeks later the GP said I didn't need them as they would make no difference due to the other medication I am on that looks after my blood pressure."
Martlesham,Mixed experience,2/19/2019,4,"We find that we can access appointments on the day reasonably easy and staff are quite helpful with process.  If you need a routine appointment, there is a long delay in access and staff are less kind when you asking about this.  They just get defensive."
Martlesham,Mixed messages,1/2/2019,3,"I was told this morning when I called, that there were no appointments. When I got the opportunity to speak I told the receptionist that the Health visitor had said that my child needed to urgently see a GP and miraculously they then had an appointment for mid morning.
I now have been referred to the hospital with potentially life changing condition for my child.
Being on the receiving end of this, it does not instill confidence in you that you are being treated fairly.  It will make me question in the future if they say that they do not have appointments at first."
Martlesham,Need to use simpler language,10/8/2016,4,"I just find they explain things in a manner that is a little hard for me to pick up. I have a hearing aid, but it just does take me a while to digest things."
Martlesham,Need to word things in kinder manner,1/31/2019,3,"I find the staff on reception are not consistent.  I have had phone calls where their attitude was not great. Just the way they put things.  However, one member was lovely and trying to help me as she knew I was worried about my child.  The way she spoke was 'can do' attitude even though they had no appointments left that morning.  The comparison was where one said 'we have no appointments, try again tomorrow'.  The other receptionist said 'I am sorry, I understand you are worried but all our morning appointments have gone, however please call at noon and I can see if we can book you one at Riverside for the GP+ service'.  
This is the same answer, but just put better."
Martlesham,No complaints,9/14/2018,5,"I am here for a blood test today. I rarely need to see a GP, but when I do I get to see someone. I have no complaints"
Martlesham,No option but online,2/11/2022,1,The whole 'impression' given is that patients are not welcome. We are kept at arms length. The worst thing is turning off 'AskMyGP' over the weekend and out of hours. Took me days before I could use the system because of this issue. I cannot ring in due to work and online for me is then the only option.
Martlesham,No problems,2/11/2022,5,Mainly access for blood tests regularly and they are timely. I never have issues on this. Staff always kind and polite and results acted on quickly.
Martlesham,No problems,10/14/2020,5,Nothing further to say.
Martlesham,Not very welcoming,9/14/2018,3,"The staff - I find Receptionists often not 'welcoming'.  The clinical staff are very good, caring and kind"
Martlesham,Nurse sorted my asthma control significantly.,4/8/2020,5,"A very patient-oriented asthma review, with significant modification of daily medication; an update onto a combined preventer/long term reliever regime, that has minimised any need for an additional short term reliever over the past 4 months"
Martlesham,"Obstructive, rude receptionist",9/3/2021,1,"If the telephone messaging prior to getting through to reception doesn't finish you off, the obnoxious, obstructive and unempathetic receptionist may do.

If you manage to convince the receptionist that you are worthy of an appointment after pleading, begging and advising of health conditions serious or not, you may be granted a telephone consult with a Dr or in 8/10 cases told to call back the following morning, to face yet another roasting from the receptionist.

The Drs themselves are helpful, but telephone consults limited and the only option being offered, however they can give you an face to face if you are prepared to travel an hour away to do so!"
Martlesham,Ok..,2/25/2021,2,"I changed surgery as moved address,the surgery itself is ok.. receptionist clearly hates her job and maybe she should find a new job and do something she loves???? everytime I call it's always seem to be same lady, rude and miserable. Terrible service. Doctors and nurses are fine, problem is the receptionist! Its not very nice to be spoken to over the phone like that when you're I  pain and just want to book appointment."
Martlesham,On line repeat prescrition logon frustration,7/23/2020,1,I can only have two months supply of pills. The password expires at the end of the month. It will not allow me to reset my password!!!
Martlesham,Online only 'in-hours',2/11/2022,5,"I have seen all sorts of professionals here. I feel that only having an online system open with the surgery is open is bizarre though. I have had call-backs and then appointments on the same day as submitting something online, which is good, but it puts pressure on the timescale for you as a patient when you have work yourself during these times."
Martlesham,Pathetic Appointment System,6/14/2021,1,"Its a pathetic appointment booking system, call at 8am be in the queue to be told appointment by the receptionist cant be given try again tomorrow. 

Does not consider the need of the patients no duty of care at all."
Martlesham,Pleasant Doctors Surgery,8/27/2019,3,I come monthly for a routine appointment and the nurse I see is always very helpful and if needs be will extend the appointment to give us longer to discuss plans. I do find the receptionists to be quite rude and abrupt when talking with them whether it be on the phone or at the front desk.
Martlesham,pushed online,12/10/2022,2,"Phoned for an appointment but was told quite 'shortly' to apply online via Ask My GP. We did that and found it quite easy, we await the result of that....now 2 days later"
Martlesham,rather quick,5/16/2022,5,i sent a email in the morning and got a call back within the hour very good service
Martlesham,Really good here,9/14/2018,5,"Everything is really good here for me.  I have no complaints as I get to see a GP when I need one, which is not often"
Martlesham,"Reception not helpful, abrupt",8/23/2021,1,"I was trying to make an urgent appointment and being told, ""there is nothing I can do, call again tomorrow"". They would not look at a booking for tomorrow, must call back again at 8am."
Martlesham,Regular nurse appointment,1/2/2019,5,"I visit the nurse weekly, and rarely any problems obtaining an appointment.  Only occasionally are there delays at the appointment.  The Nurse is excellent with her treatment and care of me."
Martlesham,repeat prescriptions,11/10/2020,3,Login was lengthy and confusing. New system is more complicated why does new always mean worse service ?
Martlesham,Rude reception staff,2/15/2021,2,"Terrified to ring to make an appointment, you might get two words out before you are usually shot down or snapped at. I appreciate it's a busy job but they need to remember it can be intimidating to phone through and perhaps some staff training is needed."
Martlesham,Rude Reception Staff,10/26/2020,1,"I have been using the surgery for years, progressively reception staff have become ruder and ruder. Very cold and obstructive. Customer service is a must when you are dealing with people who could potentially have fatal illnesses!"
Martlesham,Text service is very helpful,6/5/2016,4,"I have had numerous appointments with the nurse, doctor and Midwife, and I have always managed to get one on the day when needed. I find the text reminder service very helpful, as I am here there and everywhere so it is easy to forget."
Martlesham,Told to go home,2/11/2022,2,"Not impressed as after Covid I walked in 'out of breath' and told to go home and go online - They FORCE this. I had a phone call a week later! I asked for an inhaler and was told to try an anti-histamine, which I did take a few days on the trot, but no change. I asked them for an X-ray as they offered nothing. I had to ask for everything. I had a phone call, and they said 'well you don't sound too bad!' Ridiculous. I was not invited in to even have a peak flow measured or anything. I am having to ring/go online again. It is now weeks since that first contact about this and all this back and forth surely takes up more time and resources."
Martlesham,Told to go PRIVATE!,2/11/2022,3,I don't even know who my GP is anymore. One has contact mainly with a nurse. My last contact was concerning a long standing problem. The locum who made contact with me suggested I went privately! Sadly I have now done so. That is not good!
Martlesham,"Totally professional service, speedy referral",10/23/2019,5,"The doctor afforded me a thorough examination, assessed the potential problems and ensured that the local Hospital tested me on these matters. I was speedily issued with prescriptions and advice and treated with empathy and good manners.
Thank you for your help."
Martlesham,"Unfriendly, curt staff",4/19/2021,2,"I am a patient-facing health care professional myself. I understand well the pressures facing key workers and often encounter distressed, angry and grieving patients. I endeavour always to smile, make eye contact, listen carefully and not pre-judge. I hate ringing this surgery. The staff are too frequently abrupt, don’t listen well and seldom offer a kind word. Some serious customer relation training is needed to address some v ingrained ways of responding."
Martlesham,Unnecessarily rude,9/10/2021,1,Phoned for an emergency appointment and the receptionist who I dealt with was extremely rude and made what was already a difficult situation even worse. I will never deal with this place again. They had no consideration for my issue.
Martlesham,Use of AskMyGP,2/11/2022,4,"The AskMyGP system generally works well with call backs usually received quite quickly, but nearly always with someone other than a GP. I have a re-currant issue that needs quite frequent contact with the surgery. I do have some concerns that a GP does not have involvement in my care and that it is always another healthcare professional. Whilst I appreciate these are well trained professionals, they probably do not have the expertise that I would expect a GP to have."
Martlesham,Used to be able to  log in to see test result,10/13/2021,3,"I wanted to be able to log in to see the results of my recent blood tests, but couldn't work out how to do it. It was much easier with the previous system. Very disappointing."
Martlesham,Variable service,2/11/2022,4,"My last appointment was the flu Jab and that was pretty straight forward (not much can go wrong really).
My previous appointment was good and I have been seen fairly quickly however, I would prefer to see a GP rather than a Paramedic as the lack of experience is evident and you then see someone else too.
I use the online system, AskMyGP and it is ok and pretty quick, which is better than hanging on the telephone for ages. It did however, take more than a week to get things resolved, seeing 2 different people did not help."
Martlesham,Very abrupt receptionist,12/14/2021,3,"Don't take it out on the patient if the doctor tells a patient to come to your dispensary only to be told abruptly ""I cant do that its got tesco on"". I explained the doctor checked that you had them in stock. Her response again ""well I cant do that! When challlenged I said ""maybe you should tell the doctor instead of the patient""? only to be told ""he don't know, he is new""! If the surgery wasnt so stretched I would have submitted a complaint. We are asked to be polite, why isnt this staff member?, I work under pressure and have done all through covid and have never made a customer feel so intimated."
Martlesham,very amenable,7/3/2019,4,"I am temporarily registered here, as I am visiting, so judgement only based on one visit.
I can say that they have been very amenable, fitting me in at quite short notice.
They are running behind by 20 minutes, but that's my only criticism."
Martlesham,Very caring service,1/9/2017,4,They provide a very caring service. The only negative is the waiting time for your appointment
Martlesham,Very impressed,7/15/2019,5,"Got an appointment within a say for the nurse.
Very impressed
Staff are lovely and always helpful.
Appointment is running behind today."
Martlesham,Waiting times too long,6/5/2016,4,"when I need to get an appointment for myself (parent/adult) it is really difficult, but I can almost always get one for my child. However, even with an appointment I often wait for an hour to be seen, which is far too long and very difficult with a toddler."
Martlesham,Works for me,7/3/2019,4,"In the main I get an appointment when I need one and there is a mix of 'on the day' and more advanced ones, usually with the nurse.
Things do tend to run about 10-20 minutes late, which isn't unreasonable I feel."
Mendlesham,20mins on the phone,7/10/2022,4,I spent 20 minutes on the phone when I called Bacton but it said I was first in the queue which didn't seem right. I had an online medication reveiw which was fine. The only problem was that I didn't have a blood pressure machine or scales at home so I've had to come in anyway to have those measured.  The staff are nice and polite and are helpful when trying to arrange appointments. I've also not had any problems getting to see a doctor when I've needed to.
Mendlesham,A breath of fresh air,2/18/2022,5,Compared to our previous surgery this one is a breath of fresh air. I've been able to get through on the phone and we've had phone consultations which have worked really well. The doctor is warm and welcoming and we've had a conversation about the issue and now have a face to face appointment which is great.
Mendlesham,A good surgery,2/18/2022,4,Generally it's a good surgery. Last summer i did struggle to get to talk to someone but since then I've not needed to be seen. There have been delays getting my medication at times and I've actually run out before they've been available but this could be due to delivery issues outside of the control of the surgery.
Mendlesham,A good surgery,7/3/2019,4,"No problems identified here, it's a good surgery"
Mendlesham,A good surgery,5/13/2019,5,I can get appointments straight away and it all works well for me. I'm happy to see the nurse when needed and can generally see the person you want to see. Nothing needs improving.
Mendlesham,A smashing surgery!,10/20/2016,5,"A really good surgery, smashing!  The staff at the surgery are all nice and the nurse practitioners are really excellent.  It feels like a family surgery.  I'm happy with the GP I see too."
Mendlesham,A very good surgery,8/27/2021,5,"We find it a very good surgery, I do regular medication collections for people and never have any issues and the doctors are always happy to discuss any concerns we have."
Mendlesham,A very good surgery,8/27/2021,5,"The staff are really friendly and approachable and I get on well with my doctor, I don't need to come often but when I do they are great which gives you confidence."
Mendlesham,A very good surgery.,8/21/2018,5,Can get appointments easily and its a very good surgery. Online ordering for prescriptions works really well but it would be nice to be able to order more than one months supply at a time.
Mendlesham,A wonderful Surgery.,9/2/2017,5,A really wonderful surgery;  I couldn't expect any more from them.  Staff are helpful and listen to concerns.
Mendlesham,Absolutely brilliant,8/27/2021,5,"There are no delays getting prescriptions, they are always ready on time and staff are so accommodating when trying to get appointments, they are just great."
Mendlesham,Absolutely brilliant.,9/2/2017,5,The practice nurse at the surgery has been absolutely brilliant.  She's dressed our son's wound regularly and the treatment and care has been great.  The pharmacy were really good and recommended getting a 3 month card. They got all the dressings and antibiotics needed
Mendlesham,Accommodating GPs,6/28/2022,5,"I don't use the surgery much but when I do the GPs are accommodating and the appointment system works well. I'm a fan of econsult and the call backs as they work really well and prevent having to come to the surgery unnecessarily. If you do need an appointment on the day having to call at either 8am or 12 can be difficult with work and if there are no appointments at 8 you have to then go through the whole process again at 12. The staff are lovely and polite and they've helped to address and deal with phone problems I've been having which has made it difficult to make and receive calls, but they've been very accommodating."
Mendlesham,Accommodating staff,9/10/2018,4,Staff are quick to give you an appointment and are so accommodating plus they fit you in when its urgent. The appointments keep to time which is good but there are times when medications aren't available  to be collected on time.
Mendlesham,All good,6/10/2022,5,No issues getting appointments. I do mainly see the nurses for my diabetes and they give very good explanations and information. The treatment and care is good and staff have alsways treated me well.
Mendlesham,Always able to get an appointment,6/21/2016,5,You are always able to get an appointment when you need one and the practice nurse is marvellous
Mendlesham,Always able to get appointments,7/15/2019,5,"Always able to get appointments, I identify that sometimes they don't always have my prescription in stock. I like it here but I wish the doctor would say is there 'anything else' this would make me feel that I am obliged to rush out or take up more time than I'm allowed."
Mendlesham,Always get appointments when needed,5/25/2017,5,Can always get appointments when needed.  It's a good surgery and meets all our requirements.
Mendlesham,Appointment arranged easily,8/27/2021,4,"Very easy to get appointments when you need one and I've had good care from the surgery, with staff being caring and supportive."
Mendlesham,Appointment availability an issue,2/13/2023,4,"Capacity for appointments is limited at times and I wish that doctors especially would be more careful with what they tell you to do.  In appointments they will often say I need to see you next week but when try to book its not possible for some reason.  It's frustrating but also makes it look like the reception staff aren't allowing you to do what the doctor wants when it isn't their fault.  I was recently asked by dispensary to pick one item of medication up from the Mendlesham surgery and another from the Bacton surgery which was frustrating.  Luckily I drive so apart from the time and cost I could at least do it, other people may not be in the same position."
Mendlesham,Appointments are easy to make,7/15/2019,5,"Appointments are easy to make, staff are friendly. They let you know if the doctor is running late.
I like the fact that you can book ahead, I only wait about 10-15 minutes before I get called in.
I wish there was an area of activity for the children."
Mendlesham,Appreciate how quickly we're seen.,9/10/2018,5,Its nice to have a personal service where they fit you in as soon as possible. Most of the time you're seen the same day and I really appreciate how quickly we are seen. All my midwife appointments at the surgery have been great and I had a number to call if I was at all concerned.
Mendlesham,Appropriate use of telephone consultation,8/2/2022,5,"On two occasions I have needed a relatively straightforward  consultation with a GP at Manor Farm surgery in Bacton. On both occasions the receptionist gathered relevant information to ascertain that a telephone consultation was the correct course of action and I was advised when the GP would call me back. 
The call back came promptly at the allocated time and the discussion and following actions resolved my problems.
I found this an excellent service that saved time for both the GP and myself. 
The GPS at this surgery are using this service appropriately and I hope this will be continued."
Mendlesham,Better than was,2/13/2023,4,I booked yesterday by phone after speaking to reception. I spoke to reception and explained why I needed an appointment and they arranged for me to be seen today.  I'm not worried who I see as they are all good. The dispensary has improved completely and there are now no delays and nothing at the surgery needs to improve.
Mendlesham,Blood test in a week,2/13/2023,3,Recently appointments have been easier but I have struggled and I do not like being asked why I need an appointment by reception staff. I recently was told by one member of staff when I called that I needed to finish the course of antibiotics I was on before having another appointment even though my symptoms were worsening which I did not feel was appropriate.  Medication is a problem to get at times as not all items are available.  My husband needs specific medication for each eye but the swap for a cheaper option and also do not follow the advice of his consultant which is that he should have separate bottles for each eye rather than just the one.
Mendlesham,Blood test in a week,2/13/2023,4,"When I called to arrange a blood test I was given an appointment in a weeks time which was good but I do find getting a face to face appointment with a doctor more difficult. I've been able to speak to them on the phone but when I've asked to be seen it has been seen as unnecessary.  For one issue recently I had to wait 2 weeks for a telephone appointment. Once with or seen by staff they are all very good, it's just being able to get an appointment."
Mendlesham,Brilliant,12/14/2017,5,"Brilliant, so well organised and very caring. When you ring they will always fit you in."
Mendlesham,Brilliant Surgery,8/28/2018,5,"I recently joined this surgery after moving into their area.  I cannot believe the difference from my old surgery.  I can get an appointment without having to wait 3 weeks, staff are lovely and kind, my old surgery could do with looking how this one is run!!"
Mendlesham,Busy at the moment,6/28/2022,5,A really good surgery but you can tell they are busy at the moment. I've had no issues with my medications and you get very good care. It has been more challenging to get a face to face appointment with a doctor but the nurse practitioners are outstanding when you see them.
Mendlesham,Call backs are quick,2/18/2022,5,I called the surgery and received a call back quickly by the doctor and was then invited in to the surgery to see them so I'm very happy with how its all working at the moment. I find the GP very professional and my medication is available when needed.
Mendlesham,Can get appointment when I need them,6/10/2015,4,I really like the surgery as I can get appointment when I need them.
Mendlesham,Cannot fault them,6/27/2017,5,Really can't fault the practice.  I called the other day and received a home visit within an hour.  All the staff are very friendly and approachable  Really a very good surgery  All pleasant to talk to
Mendlesham,Can't fault the surgery.,2/21/2017,5,Can't fault the surgery.  We've always been very well looked after by the doctors and the surgery does everything we need it to do
Mendlesham,Cant rate high enough!,6/15/2017,5,I can't rate my surgery highly enough.  It's a great surgery.  No problems getting appointments and doctors are very good.
Mendlesham,Can't rate highly enough,8/27/2021,5,The surgery are absolutely fantastic including the GPs. When you call and need to see a doctor quickly i'm always able to get an appointment and they deal with issues quickly. Referrals all through covid have been done quickly through to West Suffolk Hospital. The pharmacy staff are also really helpful.
Mendlesham,Care is good,2/18/2022,4,Reception can be a little slow at times but the care is good. I've seen most of the doctors and I've been happy with everything.
Mendlesham,Care is very good,5/13/2022,4,The surgery is normally very good and care provided is likewise but I'm struggling to get medication and I only have enough for today and my medication isn't ready to pick up. I don't know what to do.
Mendlesham,Care is very good,5/13/2022,3,The care provided by the surgery is very good but the dispensary is running behind at the moment and I've run out of medication now as I've been waiting for 3 weeks. I don't know what to do as the surgery have asked patients not to call and to just wait for the text to say the medication is ready to pick up.
Mendlesham,Caring and dealt with quickly and competently,6/24/2015,4,I had a few different issues and my GP covered all of these quickly but covering all possible issues. GP was very understanding and willing to help. Other staff members can be a little blunt and less compassionate.
Mendlesham,Complete lack of care for my wife,2/9/2020,1,My wife has been ill for some time and the doctor ordered her a Covid19 Test before she could have a blood test . This came back 24 hours later and was negative. She has now been told she can’t have a blood test for another 9 days because they are busy ! The doctor said he Wanted this done immediately . Was told to call back to see if there was any cancellations but obviously there wasn’t and in the meantime another two days waiting time was added for a blood test because the receptionist didn’t make an appointment for my wife in the first place !!Mendlesham receptionist did not care in the least .Was told to contact Bury or Ipswich hospitals !! What sort of care is that ? Awful way to treat your patient who is extremely worried!!!
Mendlesham,Couldn't really ask for much more,12/2/2020,5,"I can get an appointment easily usually on the same day, I find the staff to be helpful and friendly, I couldn't really ask for much more, nothing to improve."
Mendlesham,Delays with dispensary,6/28/2022,3,The dispensary is currently slower than normal and medication is not always available when picking prescriptions up. They have been noticeably busy recently which has had an impact. It has been explained to me that  the team have had members off sick recently and this has caused problems.
Mendlesham,Different to what it used to be,6/10/2022,4,"Doing a good job but its different to what it used to be like.  Its always easy to see a nurse. I've called 5 times and spoken to a doctor but the initial thoughts are being backed up by the blood test so the issues are still ongoing. Staff are generally good, have had one occasion where the consultation was incredibly short and abrupt so I do try to avoid that person now but overall reasonablly happy."
Mendlesham,Difficult to see own GP,6/12/2023,4,"It is difficult to see your own GP and it does mean you have to go over your history each time you see someone different. I've had limited support from the Link Worker based at the surgery, 1 appointment and then nothing happened."
Mendlesham,Do prefer the old system,7/10/2022,5,"I need to get used to the new way things are working but it's been ok to get appointments and I can see the same GP most of the time too which I do like. I find econsult a bit mixed, its more drawn out but to be fair it does work to get you the help you need in most situations."
Mendlesham,Doing a good job,7/10/2022,5,"I don't need to visit the surgery much as mainly pick up my medications but, when I do, I'm very happy with the care provided."
Mendlesham,Don't change a thing,7/15/2019,5,"Always get an appointment when needed.
I cannot think of anything that I would change about this surgery."
Mendlesham,Drawn out process,8/12/2022,4,"The system in place to get appointments is now much more drawn out. It was such a great surgery, it's just that its more difficult to access now. The care though is very good. I don't like that ear syringing is not available anymore through the NHS."
Mendlesham,Dr's are great,6/28/2022,5,"I'm very happy with the surgery, I've been here a long time and the doctors are all great and I'm happy to see any of them. Reception staff are friendly,  helpful and patient, it's a good surgery."
Mendlesham,Drs are lovely,8/27/2021,5,"The doctors are really lovely and the receptionists and dispensary staff are wonderful and helpful. It does take some time to be able to see one specific GP but I'm confident that if I need to see someone more urgently I will be seen on the day. The changes put in place due to the building work has been a bit confusing when I'm picking up medication for different people as for some you can go to Mendlesham others you have to go to Bacton, I just need to get used to it. I do miss having face to face appointments, however having a call back and chat with the doctor has worked well."
Mendlesham,Easy to get appointments,7/10/2022,5,I only use the surgery every now and then but I've been invited in for my jabs on time and have found getting an appointment when I've needed it fine.
Mendlesham,Econsult drawn out process,6/10/2022,3,"Have had trouble getting a child seen and have found econsult a bit of a drawn out process and get told to go to A&E so I've had to change answers.  At times it can also feel like they just want to push you off to a different service rather than just see you. I had an accident, its not healing but have been told to self refer to physio but I haven't seen a doctor since 5 weeks after the accident and the initial problem and it is now months later. I feel they don't even know whether physio will address the issue or not."
Mendlesham,Econsult works well,2/18/2022,5,When I've needed to be seen I've been able to get a face to face appointment and the econsult system works well for me. The doctors are thorough and explain things well and I've found blood tests easy to get. The appointments are running a little behind today but its not a big problem.
Mendlesham,Excellent,8/27/2021,5,"An excellent surgery, I really can't fault them, they are so helpful and supportive and staff really care. They have been great recently and have really helped when my mum was discharged from hospital."
Mendlesham,Excellent,11/27/2015,5,The whole atmosphere when you go in is great.  They are all very friendly
Mendlesham,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,All the staff are very friendly and they do all they can to get appointments to fit around me.  The pharmacy is really good and will do anything they can to sort any problems out
Mendlesham,Excellent. GP very caring but often long waits,1/11/2016,4,"Excellent GP practice, very caring GP - really  listens.  Sometimes dreadful waits which is difficult when one is busy"
Mendlesham,Excelllent,9/2/2017,5,We've never had any problems with the surgery and feel that we are very lucky never to have any problems getting appointments.
Mendlesham,Fairly easy to get an appointment.,9/10/2018,5,"Its fairly easy to get an appointment and the doctors are accessible, they really listen to what you are saying. Doctors do need to listen to patients and to be open to changing tact. On the whole it all works very well."
Mendlesham,First class surgery,12/14/2017,5,A first class surgery. One of the best surgeries around
Mendlesham,Friendly approach,9/10/2018,5,"Very obliging, normally you get an appointment the same day, they're very good. All the doctors are great, very understanding and listen, very friendly in their approach. The dispensary has improved recently and overall nothing really needs changing, its great."
Mendlesham,Friendly staff,5/9/2018,5,I've just joined the practice but everything has gone well. Staff are friendly and approachable and I get on well with my doctor. Being in a smaller surgery is good and you can generally get on the day appointments.
Mendlesham,Generally good,6/22/2018,5,Generally a good surgery. I can get appointments whenever I need them and the care is always good.
Mendlesham,Generally works very well,2/25/2019,5,You can phone up and get an appointment when you need one and as quickly as you need it too. The pharmacy has been busy over the last 2 months and it does take a bit longer to get medications but as I only have a monthly prescription its not a real problem. It generally works very well and the staff are friendly.
Mendlesham,Getting appointments is fine,8/27/2021,5,I don't come very much  but when I have needed an appointment I've been able to get one and I've had no problems getting my prescriptions over the last year either. A good surgery that works well for me.
Mendlesham,good,10/10/2016,4,Staff are good.  The business changes recently have impacted on the care provided on the care provided as it has been more difficult to get appointments
Mendlesham,good,10/10/2016,4,The surgery is generally good.  I have had to wait to see a nurse but that is unusual
Mendlesham,Good appointments,12/2/2020,4,"Its local and handy to where I live, I can get appointments when I want them which is good."
Mendlesham,Good call backs,6/28/2022,4,The call backs form GPs work well but I do feel that if you ask for an actual appointment with a doctor they should be more freely available. Having said that when I've asked I have been given one.
Mendlesham,Good communication,12/2/2020,5,"I can always get an appointment when I need it. All staff are very polite and helpful, the customer service is very good indeed. Good communication if they happen to be running late with appointments. I can't fault them, they even Email me when my prescription is ready."
Mendlesham,Good explanation,7/15/2019,5,"Appointments are good to get, getting appointment for bloods is all done on site. Staff let me know if the GP is running late. I changed my medication recently and good explanation."
Mendlesham,Good mental health support,6/28/2022,5,"Fridays seem very busy at the moment especially for the dispensary. We're very lucky to have such a good surgery where if you need to be seen by a GP you are. They will always squeeze you in, they are very accommodating.  They offer good mental health support from the doctor, very proactive and a brilliant GP offering a very holistic approach. I was very impressed by one of the new GPs too."
Mendlesham,Good staff,2/13/2023,4,The waiting area is very cold but appointment wise its good to get them. Todays appointment was pre booked with the nurse on monday so I've only had to wait 2 days. Staff are good and explain things really well. It would be nice to have more continuity but not essential. I've had no issues getting medications now but in covid it was more difficult. It would be nice if someoe could always be on reception so they can deal with people coming in.
Mendlesham,Good staff,2/13/2023,4,"It is busy, I called last week and asked for a phone call with a GP but was told there were none available but was given an appointment with a nurse practitioner today. I would've liked one sooner if at all possible.  The staff are really good it's just the access to appointments that is a bit of an issue."
Mendlesham,Good surgery,2/13/2023,4,A good surgery with lovely staff but I wish that they would let you know before picking up medication if items are missing as you could then request a separate prescription be ready so you can collect it from a different pharmacy rather than making multiple visits.
Mendlesham,Good surgery,2/13/2023,4,"Its good at the moment. Appointments are available when needed, may be not really quickly at time but in a reasonable time frame.  The dispensary has settled down now and it is easier to get medications. I do like seeing my GP as she knows me but I'm happy to see any of the staff as they are all good."
Mendlesham,"Good, friendly customer service",7/15/2019,5,"Appointments easy to get. Staff are always friendly, good customer service. 
Would be nice on occasion to know you can get appointments outside normal surgery times, I didn't know GP plus was a thing."
Mendlesham,Great nurse practitioner,7/16/2015,5,I visit the nurse practitioner regularly and couldn't get better treatment.
Mendlesham,Great surgery,6/2/2023,5,A great surgery where you get seen really quickly at either of the surgery sites and I feel that the doctors have taken all of mums problems seriously and have acted quickly. They really are a wonderful surgery.
Mendlesham,Happy to see any doctor,5/9/2018,5,"Always really helpful, never had a problem and I can get an appointment when needed. I'm also happy to see any of the doctors at the practice. May be in certain situations the radio could be turned down a bit, I did see a person who had a severe migraine struggling with it. The staff are always cheerful and friendly and you can get blood tests done at the surgery easily enough. It would be good if x-rays could be done more locally."
Mendlesham,Happy with how it works,8/27/2021,5,I'm happy with how everything is working at the moment. The staff are really good at Bacton and I don't have any issues accessing care when I need it.
Mendlesham,Hardly any waiting time in surgery,7/15/2019,5,Getting an appointment is easy and waiting to get to see the nurse there is hardly any waiting time in the waiting room. I can't identify that I would change anything about this surgery.
Mendlesham,Heated talk with Dr. over timing of flu injection,10/11/2020,3,"Having just had a very unhelpful telephone call from  a doctor
I am elderly years old  and I am being treated for age related degenerative conditions. My concerns and the purpose of my call was over concerns of contracting the prevalent Coronavirus 19 about presently.
I attempted to tell the doctor than I would like a flu vaccination, which he freely admitted I was eligible for, and without being given the opportunity to explain my request,  I  was told that I could not have this vaccination until 15 November 2020. He asked if I had received a letter giving me dates for vaccination clinics, and I confirmed I had, but the dates were not convenient. In the past I arrived at their Surgery and the Nurse just gave me a vaccination.

However I attempted to explain that the ‘flu vaccination may have been helpful as a palliation, as well as a protection, and it might reassure me until I was able to be tested for Covid19 infestation. The doctor would not listen and constantly, and loudly, spoke over me and then ended the call.
Whilst I am fully aware of the current situation, is this really the way we are to expect to be treated my General Practice doctors?"
Mendlesham,Helpful friendly staff,2/20/2019,4,"I'm generally happy with the GP I see, they are very nice and helpful. Staff are all polite and helpful when discussing issues with them. It would be great if the surgery could offer a Saturday surgery to help people who work. When I was very unwell I came to the surgery to see the doctor and they saw me quickly. When I have blood taken at the hospital they use butterflies but the practice use the normal needles, in the long run it would save money to have them used at the surgery. It would be good to have a blood pressure machine in the waiting area. I've seen this at another surgery and considering I have weekly appointments with the nurse and this would reduce the number I would need. It does now take more time to get my prescription and when I needed medication to tide me over in an emergency I found that they wouldn't help which was disappointing."
Mendlesham,Helpful staff,9/23/2021,5,"Its a great local surgery, staff are always helpful. Medication is always available fairly quickly when it's needed. The waiting room is comfortable enough and I can get appointments when I need them. The only concern I have is the future need for services when more housing is developed."
Mendlesham,I love this surgery,7/15/2019,5,"I love this surgery, it's the best surgery I've been to.
It's very easy to get an appointment and the GP is excellent. 
I can get prescriptions here and blood tests all on site.
Would be nice to have something for the children.
Would be nice to have a Saturday service."
Mendlesham,I really like this surgery,7/15/2019,5,"It's good to have nurse practitioners on site. I can always get an appointment with ease. I really like this surgery.
I would prefer if the radio was not on talking channels, music would be better for me as it interferes with my hearing impairment. 
I like the dispensary, it's all very convenient for me."
Mendlesham,Improved and more settled,7/10/2022,5,I'm finding the surgery overall has improved and it is more settled now. The dispensary staff are really great and very helpful and they are quick to get medication in.  I like the text message that is sent to tell you when medication is ready to pick up as it save coming to the surgery unnecessarily. I've had one occassion where I felt the doctor was quite rude but overall it's a good surgery.
Mendlesham,Keep it just as it is!,12/2/2020,5,"Appointments are easy to get and very quickly seen, no issues, just hope they keep it just as it is now!"
Mendlesham,Kind and Helpful staff,12/2/2020,5,"Kind and helpful staff, they are always pleasant on the phone. I always manage to get an appointment easily.  Very good."
Mendlesham,Like queue system on the phone,7/10/2022,5,"I like that you are told where in the queue you are when calling the surgery, the phones are busy but this helps and you ultimately get the help you need. I find the staff really good and I'm happy to see any of them and after a difficult period the dispensary is back to normal which is great."
Mendlesham,Long queues for dispensary,6/28/2022,4,It's good in lots of aspects especially when you see someone in person but there are often long queues for the dispensary.  May be on prescriptions patients could be encouraged to only come to the surgery when medications are ready to collect as this would reduce the queue.
Mendlesham,Lovely staff,6/7/2022,5,There are fantastic doctors at the surgery and they'll always fit you in and sort things out for you. I've never had a problem at all and all the staff are lovely.
Mendlesham,Mainly phone calls,2/13/2023,4,Staff are lovely but most contact is by phone calls now.  It's a good surgery but it is more difficult than it used to be. When sending photos via econsult it is unclear if they have been received.
Mendlesham,Managed Prescriptions never on time,12/19/2022,1,"I have managed prescriptions set up for Both Myself and Husband.  
My Husband suffers severe withdrawal side effects if he misses one of his medications. Every single Month I ring on the Friday before they are due on the Monday where I am assured they will be ready. I ring again on The Monday morning to double check and am again assured they will be ready and I will get a text. 
It never happens. I will have to keep calling and repeatedly tell them the importance of them being ready until usually around 3 or 4 days late I get them. 
Meanwhile I have to deal with the severe side effects that My Husband goes through until they are ready. 
Every single Month."
Mendlesham,Medication not available,6/28/2022,3,The care provided by the surgery is very good and they've seen me really quickly when needed but medication is not always available. I've put requests in early but I've still had to come back multiple times to get get medication as may be only half of what is needed has been supplied. I don't have a mobile phone so can't get text messages sent which means lots of visits to the surgery.
Mendlesham,Medication not available,6/28/2022,4,"There seems to be a lack of some medications here which has meant having to travel around to different pharmacies for specific items. I also at times have had issues when my notes are not read and being prescribed non dissolvable medication/ tablets. I need to be able to take them in liquid form. I now tend to put  a note on my prescription as a reminder. The staff are very good if a mistake does occur and they sort it out quickly. Care with our current GP has been brilliant, very caring, friendly and supportive."
Mendlesham,More difficult now,8/12/2022,4,It is now more difficult to get an appointment as you have to speak to a doctor first before being given a face to face appointment.  The care provided by the doctors and nurses is good but I don't like or understand the need to tell reception why I need an appointment.
Mendlesham,Music is too loud and wrong style of music,12/2/2020,4,The music is too loud and the style of the music is too heavy for a GP surgery it could be much more sedate this would be better. You never have to wait long to get an appointment and staff very good.
Mendlesham,My GP is excellent,12/2/2020,5,"My doctor made me feel at ease more than anyone else. Staff are really helpful, its good to be able to get good GP consistency. I cannot fault it at all. It would be nice to have a water machine in the waiting area."
Mendlesham,Never had a problem getting an appointment,2/21/2017,5,We are very lucky with the surgery.  I've never had a problem getting an appointment and even if you can't see your own doctor you can see a different doctor or nurse practitioner
Mendlesham,New prescription texts are good,2/20/2019,4,"I like the new text reminder system which is in place for prescriptions. My notes weren't up to date recently so one of the doctors called me to ask why I was being referred to hospital. Sometimes it's tricky to get an appointment on the day but once they ask for the reason ,ones often available. You don't always get to see the same gp which does mean that you  have to repeat yourself each time. It would be helpful if reception could give general information about what vaccinations or medications are needed for holidays. Appointments for holiday vaccinations were easy enough to arrange. The referral on to GP+ was a waste of time as the nurse was unable to help and I had to arrange another appointment at the surgery the next morning and may be reception should find out more information before giving the appointment."
Mendlesham,No issues getting appointments,2/18/2022,5,"I've had no issues getting appointments with a doctor, I spoke to the GP yesterday and they have been great referring me  on to AHP for physio on a back issue. There were some medication delays at the Bacton surgery when the building work was taking place but its all back to normal now."
Mendlesham,No problems,7/10/2022,5,Online econsult results in the support that is needed and it's straight forward to use. I'm happy to see any of the GPs but if it is an ongoing issue I do try to see the same one. Staff are good at explaining things and I'm happy with the surgery. There are times when medications aren't available at the dispensary and I had to take the prescription to a different pharmacy. For me thats not much of a problem but for those who don't drive or don't have internet access to be able to call all the different pharmacies to track down the medication you are looking for it would be very difficult.  It would be good for those who really can't access information if the surgery tracked the medication down for them.
Mendlesham,No review - Only ratings provided,7/16/2015,5,No review - Only ratings provided
Mendlesham,No trouble getting appointments,2/20/2019,5,"You can get appointments when they are needed ,I don't have any problems. The practice nurses are very good, they really do know you. The doctors don't know you quite so well as you see different ones each time. Having an ongoing issue, which I know when it's developing and I will need help, I used to be able to drop off a sample at the surgery for testing to save time but this has changed and I can't do this anymore."
Mendlesham,Not always forthcoming with information,7/16/2015,4,To get the full explanation of treatment you do need to know what questions to ask.  They are not always forthcoming with the information.
Mendlesham,Not easy,7/10/2022,4,Medication is available with in quicker times now and I really like the text message that is sent when they are ready to pick up. Have in the past had contact with the link worker but not had any for a long time now. My son has mental health difficulties but he won't chase or seek help and I can't because he's an adult.
Mendlesham,Nothing needs improving,6/21/2016,5,The nurses are very good and approachable. Staff will all they can to get you in when you need to see a doctor.
Mendlesham,Nothing Negative to say!,2/21/2017,5,I really don't have anything negative to say about the surgery.  I can always be seen when I need to be and the care over the years has been great
Mendlesham,Nursing staff are excellent,7/26/2022,5,Nursing staff at the practice are excellent and I prefer to see them if possible as I feel they have more time for you and see you more holistically.
Mendlesham,Often have to wait for the dispensary,8/27/2021,4,The surgery in general including the triage system works really well but I'm not very happy with the how long the waits in the queue can be for the dispensary. The increased opening hours have helped but may be staying open until 6pm would make it easier to collect prescriptions after work.
Mendlesham,One of the best in the area,7/16/2015,5,The surgery is one of the best in the area and I have no problems.  I get on really well with  the GPs.
Mendlesham,Online system works well,5/9/2018,5,"I can get an appointment whenever I need one. The doctors are all very personable and caring and booking online is easy to do and works very well. Generally it all works well for me, an online triage type system would be another option to have."
Mendlesham,Outstanding,6/16/2020,5,"An outstanding service, can always get appointments and very happy with the care provided by the surgery."
Mendlesham,Pleased with my doctors,8/21/2018,5,I really like my doctors as they listen to your concerns and really try to help. Appointments are easy enough  to get and I don't have any issues getting to see someone. They explain things well and its great to have the pharmacy on site.
Mendlesham,Polite staff.,2/20/2019,4,Staff are always polite and do what they can to get you an appointment.  Because I tend to need more urgent appointments rather than pre bookable ones it can mean that you don't get to see the same doctor very often. It would be good if the surgery could let patients know how to access our of hours services and where they are available.
Mendlesham,Problematic during Covid but now much better,7/7/2022,5,Reception always helpful.  Now able to get proper appointments.  Excellent treatment and advice from both doctors and nurses.
Mendlesham,Quality GP's,12/2/2020,4,"The location is ideal to where I live, the quality of the GP's is high, I don't have any complaints."
Mendlesham,Queue on the phones,7/10/2022,4,"There can be a queue on the phone and I've got down to 1 but it then just rings and rings which is concerning as it feels you may have been sent down a wrong route. Once through to reception appointments are fine to get and I like that staff will go through issues with you, covering all aspects. The check in screens are great to have but I don't really feel the covid screens around reception and the dispensary are needed any more as it does mean you have to speak more loudly and telling the whole waiting area your personal information."
Mendlesham,Quick efficient service,12/23/2021,5,"I submitted an online econsult and I was contacted pretty quickly to discuss my issue, I was able to explain what was wrong albeit to a student doctor, he went away and must have checked it with one of the main GP's and they called me in for an examination and the GP referred me the same day to the hospital but she did say it would be a long wait. She was understanding of my issue and had a helpful attitude."
Mendlesham,Ran out of medication,6/28/2022,4,I ran out of medication but the dispensary staff are now sending the prescription to an alternative pharmacy so I can collect there due to the difficulties they have faced getting the medications in. I've had a UTI for 6 weeks now and just keep being put on the same antibiotics which are not working. The staff in the dispensary have suggested talking to my GP about it.
Mendlesham,Really listen,8/21/2018,5,A very good surgery where you can get appointments easily. They have a good range of staff who are all very friendly . Its great they have a female doctor and they really listen and will refer you on for investigations where neccessary.
Mendlesham,Recent delays with medication,6/28/2022,4,"Delays have meant that I nearly ran out of my medication but staff have been helpful and I've now got my medication ok, just a bit more of a wait. The care provided by the clinical staff is always good and I've had no problems getting appointments when I've needed them."
Mendlesham,Recently improved,2/13/2023,5,"I've noticed a big improvement recently with the dispensary.  They are very coordinated with the doctor to ensure everything is correct. I have a very good doctor, really on the ball."
Mendlesham,Reception staff are rude and unprofessional,12/21/2018,1,"Currently pregnant and under Mendlesham surgery until I have my baby. Reception staff are reluctant to give me appointments as I’m out of area even though I have permission to be treated the same by the practice
Manager. Dispensary staff often make mistakes and aren’t competent enough when dispensing medication and often leave you short."
Mendlesham,Reception very open and not private,7/15/2019,5,"Appointment usually easy on line, there is some disruption at the moment due to changes of computer system.
The reception is quite open and privacy can be an issue, especially as they ask questions about issues."
Mendlesham,Receptionists are helpful,8/27/2021,5,I have no problems getting an appointment at either site when I need one and the receptionists are helpful and really lovely. The surgery is great.
Mendlesham,Role model,3/23/2016,5,This practice should be the role model for all surgeries. I cannot fault them!
Mendlesham,Same day appointment,12/2/2020,4,"I can get an appointment easily, it is usually on the same day if I need it. I like that fact that I get the consistency of the same GP if I need it. The GP's are good here. No improvements identified."
Mendlesham,See the same doctor,2/20/2019,5,Generally the surgery do things well but it can be difficult to see a specific doctor quickly at times but you can always see someone else. Seeing the same doctor most of the time does really help.
Mendlesham,See the same doctor when needed,2/20/2019,4,It's easy to get appointments. The surgery is clean and staff are always friendly and you always get appointments when you need one. Generally it works very well as a practice and you're able to see the same doctor when needed. I do like receiving the text reminders for appointments.
Mendlesham,Seems easier more recently,2/18/2022,4,It seems to have eased a bit more recently and appointments are easier to get. The last blood test appointment was fine to get but I do feel that covid has had an impact. Getting through on the phone was difficult at times but this has improved too.
Mendlesham,Seen quickly,2/10/2018,5,"Normally its a very good surgery where you can be seen on the day you call for an appointment. On trying recently however, I did have to wait four days which was very unusual."
Mendlesham,So efficient,12/2/2020,5,"It is so efficient at this surgery. You can ask to see a specific GP if you want to, booking appointments on line is easy. I recently had a good referral to the hospital."
Mendlesham,some delays with medication,5/13/2019,5,At times there are delays getting some medications but I tend to order in enough time so that they can reorder medication that is needed. Getting to the surgery is difficult when you rely on people giving you a lift but I don't tend to have much contact with the surgery now as the community team support us so well.
Mendlesham,Spend time with you,2/18/2022,5,I have a long term condition and the doctors have always been happy work with me to manage my condition and will always listen to me when I have an issue. It's a great practice with kind helpful staff who provide very person centred care.  I like the text message system that lets you know when your medication is ready to be picked up. I have noticed that some medication has been difficult to get and I had to go to other pharmacies to get it in time.
Mendlesham,Staff are friendly,7/11/2018,4,I am very happy with this surgery and all staff are friendly. The only thing I would mention is that sometimes the dispensary can be a little inflexible and do not seem to budge on the 48hour preparation for repeat prescriptions.
Mendlesham,Staff are great,8/27/2021,5,"Reception staff have been amazingly helpful and when we changed surgery they were really great, it all went so smoothly. The dispensary staff too have been really good ensuring everything is available when needed. I've also used econsult to get advice and appointments and that has worked well although I did need to get advice from reception about completing it and they were so helpful talking me through it.  I'm just waiting for asthma reviews to be re started as I've not had one since the beginning of covid."
Mendlesham,Staff are helpful,5/9/2018,5,"Never had a problem with the surgery. You can always get an appointment on the day. Staff are helpful and accommodating. You can also get blood tests done easily and the parking is good. I like the higher backed chairs, they're comfy and the temperature in the waiting room is good."
Mendlesham,Staff are lovely,6/28/2022,5,Staff are lovely and overall I'm happy with the service provided. It's good that face to face appointments with doctors are easier to get as in the past it was more difficult to get to see them although on most occasions I've had an appointment the following day so it does work well. I order my medication online which works well but for appointments I prefer to call as it's easy to do.
Mendlesham,Staff are very efficient,7/15/2019,5,Whenever I ting I always get an appointment. I find the staff very efficient. I like the way they text confirmation of appointment and for dispensary. I know they are changing the computer system so hopefully all will be fine without too much changes.
Mendlesham,Staff happy and friendly,12/2/2020,5,Staff always seem happy and friendly. No waiting to get an appointment. I am very happy with how it is all going at this surgery.
Mendlesham,Staff listen,6/22/2018,4,Staff listen and care for you as a patient. They will spend time with you and don't rush you out the door. Generally a good surgery
Mendlesham,Staff really listen,9/10/2018,5,"I'm really happy with the surgery, you don't have to wait too long for an appointment or to be seen at the surgery. Staff really listen to what you are saying and they are incredibly friendly and helpful."
Mendlesham,Staff sort issues out,6/28/2022,5,There's been a lot of confusion regarding my appointment this morning but eventually its all been sorted out and I've seen a GP. Having telephone and face to face appointments can be confusing and it's not the first time that the type of appointment has been mixed up. The staff though are excellent and so friendly and helpful and do all they can to sort any issues out.
Mendlesham,Starting to see a return to normal,2/17/2022,4,I'm happy with the care and treatment provided by the surgery. I've only once not been able to get a face to face appointment when I thought I needed one. It does appear that things are starting to return to normal.
Mendlesham,Supportive to children's health,12/2/2020,4,I have found them to be responsive to requests for appointments and supportive towards children's healthcare. Communication is  very good with patients. Prompt service at the dispensary.
Mendlesham,Surgery helpful with booking appointments,5/25/2017,5,I don't drive so rely on friends to take me to appointments but the surgery are very helpful and will do all they can to get me an ppointment at the best time.
Mendlesham,The care provided is great.,10/20/2016,5,The care provided is great.  I'd prefer the nurses to wear a uniform rather than normal clothing. I have also had a small issue when i was prescribed medication that was later changed by the consultant at the hospital
Mendlesham,The surgery works well,10/20/2016,5,"A very good surgery, the nurses are brilliant. the surgery works well and I can get appointments when I need them"
Mendlesham,They bend over backwards for patients,12/2/2020,5,"They bend over backwards for patients to get them an appointment, they always do for my son who has extra needs, they are very supportive to me too.I am perfectly happy with both Bacton and Medlesham as surgeries."
Mendlesham,They fit me in at short notice,12/2/2020,5,"When I ring up they are very kind to me and they can fit me in with an appointment at short notice. Sometimes you might have to wait longer at the appointment on some days but its not every time. I cannot think of any improvements needed, very good."
Mendlesham,They give you time.,9/2/2017,5,"Wonderful.  Polite, very accommodating, give you time and refer you on.  Very very pleased with the surgery and much appreciated"
Mendlesham,Things have settled down a bit,6/28/2022,5,"I've asked for a face to face appointment this morning and have been given one with the doctor so it feels like things have settled down a bit. I'm happy to see any of the GPs which possibly helps. The new waiting room layout is a little awkward as it feels like you are facing the wrong way as you are facing away from the clinician who is calling you and you have to keep looking over your shoulder to check they're not calling you. The doctors and nurses are all very good and the member of staff in the dispensary is always great, always remains calm."
Mendlesham,Treatment and care good,2/18/2022,4,I haven't needed an appointment recently but I've spoken to a doctor and the issues have been sorted out. I need to get used to how things have changed as I'm used to calling up and asking to see a specific doctor and this has all changed now. The treatment and care received from staff is always good.
Mendlesham,Triage is problematic,2/17/2022,3,I'm finding the triage system problematic as it is difficult and puts a barrier up so seeing a GP face to face is difficult. You are now having to self diagnose and tell the doctor what is wrong because they won't see you. This then leads to assumptions about your health which can be an issue and can be wrong
Mendlesham,Triage works well,2/18/2022,5,The surgery is good. The triage system works well and the call backs happen quickly. I've always been offered a face to face appointment when one has been needed and the care and advice has been very good.
Mendlesham,Triage works well,2/17/2022,4,"I find that the triage system when you talk to a GP works  well, it's possibly not quite as good as seeing someone in person. I was told after the appointment that the GP would call in a couple of weeks but this didn't happen so I called the surgery"
Mendlesham,Usual superb service,1/2/2019,5,Appointment offered promptly. Excellent consultation as always.
Mendlesham,Usually get appointments the same day,9/2/2016,5,You can usually get an appointment that day or in a couple of days. Doctors give explanations and referrals to hospital have always been good.
Mendlesham,Usually get same day appointments,2/20/2019,5,Can usually get a same day appointment and you normally get to see the same doctor who is very good.  They are especially good at getting appointments for my child.
Mendlesham,Very accomodating,6/21/2016,5,"Very accommodating, they will do all they can to squeeze you in. They are a family friendly surgery and the practice nurses are particularly good."
Mendlesham,Very attentive,2/13/2023,4,"I was told there were no appointments available but when I explained the issue I was given an appointment for Friday. Whenever I need an appointment for my baby its always fine, no question. I called late yesterday evening and was given an appointment.  Staff are very attentive when they see you even if they are running behind and the care is good.  I've had occasions when the dispensary hasn't been able to get medication in but they've always given me a prescription to take somewhere else."
Mendlesham,Very good,2/13/2023,5,"Very easy to get appointments and much easier than I expected. The nurses are fantastic and I can call or message the doctor if I am at all concerned. Having the dispensary means the dressing I've needed are available. I have had some issues getting medication when it's not been available but then I just take the prescription to Tesco and they have it.  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable, I trust them and they give confidence.  The HCA is very good and I like that  the dispensary staff know their patients well and by name. The acoustics in the waiting room mean that it is difficult to hear staff calling the next patient."
Mendlesham,Very good,5/9/2018,5,Don't use the surgery much but I can always get an appointment when I need one. They are very good all round.
Mendlesham,Very good care!,2/21/2017,5,Always had very good care from all staff at the surgery.  Just would like weekend appointments.
Mendlesham,"very good service, with great staff",5/25/2017,5,They always have time to talk to you.  They've been easy to to talk to and getting appointments is not a problem.  They are very hospitable.  Very good with referrals too.
Mendlesham,Very good staff,5/13/2022,4,The doctors and other staff are very good once you get in to see them but there does seem to be a reluctance to offer you a face to face appointment even when I've felt I needed to be seen.
Mendlesham,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,The surgery overall is very good and although I haven't needed any recent appointments. I have no concerns about getting an appointment when I do need one. On the whole the text message system in place for medications works well and they let you know when your items are ready for collection. Sometimes items aren't in stock but staff always get them in for you and there are not any long delays
Mendlesham,Very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"The surgery is very good with lovely friendly staff. I have had a few delays getting my medication from the dispensary but they will always do what they can to get what you need in. One cream I needed wasn't available but it would've been nice if the staff had just told me that I could get it from any supermarket. I only found out when I spoke to the nurse, it is a minor issue and I realise they have been very busy lately."
Mendlesham,Very happy,8/27/2021,5,"Very happy with Mendlesham surgery. The phone consultations have worked really well and I have confidence in the GPs they take time with you to explain everything. Picking up prescriptions works well and when we moved to this surgery staff ensured it all went very smoothly and quickly, very pleased to be here."
Mendlesham,Very helpful,7/11/2018,5,"Always able to get an appointment, pharmacy and reception staff are very helpful. Sometimes there can be a little wait to get in to see the doctor but 15-20 minutes is fine. I do feel there is plenty of time given to me. 
Can't think of anything I would change."
Mendlesham,Very helpful and excellent service,12/2/2020,5,"Very helpful and excellent service, its always easy to get an appointment, I've been here all my life I don't want to move."
Mendlesham,Very helpful staff  and get appointments when needed,5/25/2017,5,Really like how helpful staff are and I can get appointments when needed.  I attend monthly reviews but other than that I don't go very often
Mendlesham,Very informative,9/10/2018,5,Really helpful each time you visit and have been good to fit me in. There are very friendly staff who are also very informative. Generally the surgery works very well for me.
Mendlesham,Very informative,5/9/2018,5,Get seen quickly and they always find time to fit you in. Everything works well and its a big improvement to my previous surgery. Staff are very informative around medications as well.
Mendlesham,Very people centred,12/14/2017,5,Never had a problem. Very people centred and approachable. I feel that if I have a problem they will always do what they can. Very supportive of the children and with my son who has autism.
Mendlesham,Very pleased,6/18/2016,5,"A lot easier to get appointments here compared to elsewhere, generally I can get appointments when needed. I've always been treated well by staff and I very pleased with the surgery."
Mendlesham,Very pleased with surgery,8/27/2021,5,"I'm very pleased with the surgery and I'm happy to see any of the medical staff, doctors or nurses as they are all great. I would prefer to be able to see the same doctor but understand that this is not always possible."
Mendlesham,Very polite and friendly staff,7/15/2019,5,"Can always get an appointment here, the GP is excellent, the staff are all very polite and friendly. 
An excellent surgery"
Mendlesham,Very satisfied,11/20/2015,4,I experienced severe back pain so phoned the surgery. With in an hour and a half the doctor had called me back and discussed treatment options. He was very friendly and helpful and arranged for a family member to collect a prescription
Mendlesham,Very supportive,2/13/2018,5,"Can't fault the surgery at all, they have been so good recently. Very personal service and very supportive staff. Staff phoned to see how my husband was doing which was lovely. Can get appointments when needed and it all works well. Its helpful that you can fax, send or drop off prescriptions."
Mendlesham,Very supportive GPs,8/27/2021,5,"Having the dispensary on site is really great as there are no local pharmacies available. The annual checks are now done by the nurse which is fine but I do find I'm more hesitant to raise issues I might talk to a doctor about. When I lost my husband the GP's were very supportive and caring, coming out to see him many times.  Recently I've only really needed to pick up my prescriptions which has been problem free."
Mendlesham,Wait a bit longer to see specific GP,12/2/2020,5,"Always so polite and helpful and invariably I can always get an appointment when I need one, if I want to see a specific GP I might need to wait a few days longer. doctors and the nurse practitioner and nursing staff are very good from my experience."
Mendlesham,Waiting for dispensary a bit long,8/27/2021,3,"Getting medication from the dispensary can mean a bit of a long wait at times, with winter approaching waiting outside won't be great. I do find that staff at times could be a little more polite."
Mendlesham,Will do everything they can to sort things out.,9/2/2017,5,The surgery has been brilliant and will do all they can to sort things out.  I've never had a problem getting an appointment.  A very good surgery
Mendlesham,Working well,2/18/2022,4,It's all working well but depending on who you want to see it can be a bit more difficult. I've been happy with the care and treatment provided by the surgery and as I don't use them much it all works well.
Mendlesham,Works well,2/13/2023,5,I've had quick appointments when I've called reception and when I needed my recent review I only had to wait a couple of days. It would've been better if it had been available at the Bacton surgery but it wasn't possible and it wasn't a big issue.  I don't use the surgery much but when I do it works well.
Mendlesham,Works well,7/13/2023,5,"I've not needed a recent appointment but when I've had them its all worked very well with no delays. Medications are generally available when you need them and if not the staff will get them in for you.  I like the text message letting you know that your medication is ready to collect, prevents having to come down to the surgery to check."
Mendlesham Medical,A good surgery,7/3/2019,5,A good surgery. Usually you wait about 1/2 hr past your appointment time but you never feel rushed. You can usually get an appointment on the day with a nurse if a GP is not available. Getting a referral in the private sector is difficult. It has taken months of requesting before being referred and in the meantime unnecessary treatment and medication was tried.
Mendlesham Medical,"A good surgery, can get quick appointments",4/21/2017,5,Being able to get a quick appointment is really good. I rarely visit  but when I do everything works well and I've never had to wait more than a day to be seen.
Mendlesham Medical,A wait if you want to see the same GP,12/2/2020,5,If you want to see the same GP you have to be prepared to wait a bit longer but it is a very good surgery.
Mendlesham Medical,Accomodating staff,2/25/2019,5,"Over the years it has got more difficult to get appointments especially with a specific GP. The surgery works well and I don't really use it much, when I do though the staff are very accommodating and polite and I've always been very happy."
Mendlesham Medical,Additional services would be great,9/10/2018,3,"Using the surgery building more could be improved, having additional services available from the building would be a much better  for example a minor injuries service or x-ray facilities. Its closed a couple of afternoons a week so it could be used then. Its a friendly surgery where staff know you well and are accommodating and they try to get me an appointment here as I don't drive. It does seem a lot of wastage on medication when its wrongly prescribed or given to you in your bag."
Mendlesham Medical,Always excellent,2/3/2018,5,Staff are all friendly and offer the best care.
Mendlesham Medical,"Appointments are easy to get, no longer prescribe some items though",5/25/2017,4,Appointments are easy to get and they've been very good with the children.  Have recently picked up repeat medication only to find they will no longer prescribe certain items.  This happened with no warning
Mendlesham Medical,Appointments are on time,12/2/2020,4,"It is good to have the second surgery as a back up, the appointments are on time and it is handy to have a pharmacy on site. The location is good for me. I am new to the surgery."
Mendlesham Medical,Both surgeries are good,9/10/2018,5,"Its a nice local surgery, both surgeries are clean and good explanations are provided. Normally you get appointments the day after you call and the text reminder messages works well and staff do all they can to get you in the same day and are quite accommodating. Only having a months supply of medication can be difficult at times especially if you go away a lot."
Mendlesham Medical,Brilliant,10/19/2016,5,"It is always fast, I am seen quickly which is brilliant"
Mendlesham Medical,Brilliant staff,2/25/2019,5,Can't always get an appointment with your GP but never been let down for an appointment as I'm happy to see any of the doctors at the surgery. Medication is generally ready when needed which is good. Staff are brilliant and the call backs offered work really well. I am concerned about the additional houses there will be in the village and the extra pressure on the surgery.
Mendlesham Medical,Care is good,9/27/2022,5,Care provided is good and I generally get to see my own GP which is good because they know you well. The pharmacy is good and medication is available quite quickly.
Mendlesham Medical,Care is good,9/27/2022,5,Get to see my doctor most of the time and even when you don't the care is good. I've had an occasion when I thought I was seeing my GP but then saw a different doctor but it didn't make much difference. It's convenient having the surgery in the village and the Mendlesham surgery too.
Mendlesham Medical,Dispensary is running well,12/2/2020,4,"It is always good at this surgery, you can always get appointment when you want one. Dispensary is running well now and the repeat prescriptions are prepared on time."
Mendlesham Medical,Doctors generally good,12/2/2020,4,Doctors are generally good. I have noticed that you now have to wait 2 days for an appointment to be offered often when it used to regularly be 1 day. Parking area could be improved as it can become very full and awkward to turn around in.
Mendlesham Medical,Does exactly what i need,1/11/2018,5,ALL VERY GOOD
Mendlesham Medical,Don't like medication brands changing,2/25/2019,5,Access to appointments is very good and because you have both surgeries to attend it does make it easier. Generally I come to Bacton but if an appointment is at Mendlesham I can go there too. I don't particularly like that medication brands are constantly changing as it can be confusing when you are taking a number of different tablets. Medication from the dispensary are normally available or ready for collection in about 2-3 days which is good.
Mendlesham Medical,Dr knows me well,9/10/2018,5,Its a very good surgery and I like that my doctor knows me well. Staff are accommodating and will do all they can to fit you in and sort any issues out.
Mendlesham Medical,Dr knows us well,9/10/2018,5,Both the surgeries are the same in the level of care and treatment provided. I do get to see my doctor all the time which is important to me. The Dr knows our family and our conditions well which is very good. It would be better if when you need tests completed if you could combine appointments  so you don't have to go back day after day. I do really like my GP and having the dispensary/ pharmacy in the surgery is so good because it allows you to pick medication up before you leave the surgery.
Mendlesham Medical,Drs friendly and approachable,2/25/2019,5,"The doctors are very approachable and friendly. I book appointments by phone as and when I need one. I do find the way in which reception staff ask for reasons for the appointment can be a bit intrusive, this hasn't  been explained to me and there is no obvious message on the phone. Generally I'm quite happy with the service provided."
Mendlesham Medical,Easy to get appointments,8/18/2015,5,Easy to get appointments
Mendlesham Medical,Easy to get quick appointment,12/2/2020,5,I rang up for an appointment last night and I got one this morning you can't ask for better service. I have only ever experienced one member of staff in the dispensary as being awkward with me about issuing a repeat prescription that I had run out of.
Mendlesham Medical,EPIPEN's in short supply,12/2/2020,5,"Efficient staff and I can get an appointment as needed. I seem to be unable to get my wife's medications from this dispensary easily, they regularly give us prescriptions to go and see if we can get them from elsewhere. EPIPEN's seem to be in short supply and also Desmopressin which is a particular steroid. I do have a concern about the impact that potential new houses will have and how that will effect the surgery. I think we have a bonus that there is a female GP in the practice."
Mendlesham Medical,Excellent,2/3/2017,5,Cannot fault our local surgeries.  Very friendly and efficient.  Long may it last! Treated with respect and understanding.  We have used these surgeries for the past 20 years
Mendlesham Medical,Excellent for physical and mental health,1/11/2016,5,Overwhelmingly excellent healthcare for both physical and mental health
Mendlesham Medical,Excellent service,6/18/2016,5,"The reception staff are efficient but happy to arrange same day appointments where they can - even if the patient declines to give a reason. I have been a patient at this practice for over 30 years of excellent service.
They text when medication is ready but if I'm on holiday they will send another message if they are not collected to say the medications will go back to the dispensary store.
Excellent use is made of nurse practitioners and blood testing service."
Mendlesham Medical,"Excellent, Brilliant!",12/2/2020,5,"Excellent, Brilliant! reception, dispensary staff always very helpful. No changes needed I am quite happy the way it is."
Mendlesham Medical,Fantastic care,9/10/2018,5,"You can see a doctor when you need an appointment, I've never had an issue getting in for an appointment. They provide fantastic care and all staff are great. They should keep doing what they are doing. Medications are all available on time which makes things much less stressful."
Mendlesham Medical,Flexible with appointments,12/2/2020,5,"The way you are treated by the receptionists and doctors is marvellous. I have experienced that they are flexible in getting me an appointment according to my transport arrangements, they are very caring."
Mendlesham Medical,FrieIndly and welcoming,7/15/2019,5,"Friendly and welcoming, appointments are easy to make. 
I wouldn't change anything, just the waiting time to be a little more concise."
Mendlesham Medical,Friendly,9/29/2016,5,"Organised, easy to make appointments, staff are friendly.
Waiting at appointment can be variable depending on the day.
I wouldn't change anything, it's certainly an improvement on the old surgery."
Mendlesham Medical,Friendly staff,2/25/2019,5,"I do really like seeing the same GP most of the time and you can get appointments, especially for the children easily enough. To see a specific GP can take more time but it works well and I'm very happy with things. There are friendly and very accommodating staff at the surgery too."
Mendlesham Medical,Friendly surgery,2/10/2018,5,Its a nice friendly surgery where you know the staff well. Good care is provided by the GPs and it generally works well and you can get appointments when needed.  Nothing needs to change.
Mendlesham Medical,Generally a very good surgery.,5/25/2017,5,"Generally a very good surgery offering good care.
You do have to chase up test results as you no longer get a call back.  There does appear to be little interest in the patient after the consultation with follow ups etc.  There is a limbo where you can be in between the surgery and the hospital.  A social prescribing approach would help to support families as information is difficult to find"
Mendlesham Medical,Good communication,9/29/2016,5,"I can always get an appointment when I need one.
The care is good here, GPs are good here too. Staff are professional - we are told wen the GP is running late.
Communication is good here.
I am concerned about increased housing."
Mendlesham Medical,Good doctors,12/2/2020,5,"Good doctors here I am impressed with my doctor in particular, I can make appointments easily, I am very happy with this surgery all round. I have noticed that the pharmacy is open at Mendlesham more than it is at Bacton."
Mendlesham Medical,Happy to see any of the staff,2/25/2019,5,You can always get an appointment and can choose between different options and its good to have the flexibility. Happy to see any of the staff and nothing needs to change.
Mendlesham Medical,I am very happy with this surgery,7/15/2019,5,"I can get an appointment when I need one. Staff helpful, I would say that they give positive referrals.
I am very happy with this surgery."
Mendlesham Medical,I see the same Dr,10/8/2015,4,I see the same doctor all the time and the surgery is brilliant
Mendlesham Medical,Impressed with the speed,12/2/2020,5,"I am impressed with how quickly I can get an appointment, I can get blood tests done here if needed which is so handy for me.
Car park is a bit small but overall I am very happy to be at this surgery."
Mendlesham Medical,I've never had a problem with the surgery,2/21/2017,5,My GP has been brilliant with me.  I've never had a problem with the surgery and can always get an appointment
Mendlesham Medical,Level of care is very variable,11/17/2015,3,"Some good practice, some poor.  GP picked up on risk factors for osteoporosis for me, and referred me for a scan, even though I am relatively young.  I am grateful for this.

But surgery seems to be stuck in the 1970's in some ways. I rang and asked if my doctor could ring me back when they were next in because short telephone calls can save GP time and appointments. I was asked if I could ring back on the day that the GP was in as the GP didn't like to arrive and get a list of messages. After negotiating this the GP did ring me as arranged and was helpful, it was just a palaver. Not what I would call a progressive practice.

Both the Bacton and Mendlesham surgery have loud music from a radio station or the like.  Sorry, but it is a doctors surgery not a hairdressers.  No thought given to people who maybe noise sensitive (as I am) or simply don't want to listen to what is on. It is not playing quietly in the background but is intrusive.

I have mobility problems and not all of the staff help with the heavy doors to the clinic rooms, but sit and watch me struggle. This never happened at my previous surgery.

A friend of mine who uses the surgery had high blood pressure when she delivered her last child over 5 years ago.  Since then she never had her blood pressure checked when she went to the surgery for routine appointments. Her very high BP was only picked up when she was referred for a minor op. I was astonished. At my previous surgery I couldn't set foot in the place w/o having my BP checked, and I don't have BP problems, it was just always part of the appointment. It is painless, quick, the equipment is there and the results are immediate.

On the plus side I very much like that I can book GP appointments online, just a shame the same facility isn't available for nurse appointments. I also like that I can order repeat meds online, and there have never been any problems with this.

I get the impression that most of the staff both clinical and clerical are very stuck in their ways - it has a 'normal for Norfolk' feel about it, rather than a surgery delivery care in the 21st Century."
Mendlesham Medical,Never have any problems getting an appointment.,2/21/2017,5,Never have any problems getting an appointment.  It's great that there are two nurse practitioners to see if you can't or don't need to see a GP
Mendlesham Medical,No warning that medications wouldn't be available,5/25/2017,4,When I picked up my prescription last I opened up my bag at home to find a note saying certain medications would no longer be prescribed such as antihistamines.  Nothing was said when I picked it up and there was no warning that they wouldn't be available
Mendlesham Medical,Normally see my own doctor,2/25/2019,5,"I called last night and was booked an appointment for first thing in the morning and can get appointments whenever they are needed and usually at Bacton, preventing the need to travel to Mendlesham. Normally I get to see my own doctor but if  don't its ok to see any of the others and booking in on the computer at the surgery works ok too."
Mendlesham Medical,Not listened to,2/25/2019,5,"In the past I've been very worried about my child and I've felt not listened to and fobbed off, it resulted in an A&E attendance.  The Dr didn't even examine the child properly so this does need to improve. Since then however, it has been very good and you can get an appointment when they are needed and happy with the care provided generally."
Mendlesham Medical,Polite staff,9/10/2018,4,Getting through on the phone can take longer now but you can always get an appointment when you need one either here or at Mendlesham. Staff are polite when dealing with you. Parking is sometimes an issue especially if trying to reverse out.
Mendlesham Medical,Quick and Easy to get appointments,12/2/2020,5,It is easy and quick for me to get an appointment when I need one. Excellent surgery.
Mendlesham Medical,Some GP's look at computer screen too much,12/2/2020,4,"The friendliness of staff is very good, if you want an appointment on a certain day or time they always try to accommodate this when they can. I have found that one of the nurses has a poor attitude, my husband would actively avoid this one nurse if she is on, Some GP's are better than others and some seem to look at their computer screens too much I would like to see more patient contact. Car Park is too small for the need and it would be useful if the stones were swept off the steps leading into the surgery."
Mendlesham Medical,Staff all good,9/10/2018,5,I don't visit very often but I always get an appointment on the day that I need one. Staff are all very good and generally I see 2 or 3 of the doctors but any are good to see. The only issue I've had was when I was calling for x-ray results. Staff didn't know when the results would be in so I had to keep calling as I was told the results would be available within 5-10 days. Staff have always been friendly and approachable and do what they can to help.
Mendlesham Medical,Staff are good,2/25/2019,4,"Its all ok at the moment, you can get appointments when needed and staff are good."
Mendlesham Medical,Staff very helpful,5/25/2017,5,Staff are very helpful and they do their very best to fit you in at the end of the surgery or they will call
Mendlesham Medical,They always try to fit me in,12/2/2020,5,"They always try to fit me in on the day, getting an appointment s easy, I can ask for a specific doctor if I want to which I like the option of. I would like to see the option to have an X Ray machine set up on site."
Mendlesham Medical,Time to get appointments has inceased,2/19/2019,3,"Theres been an increase in the time  it takes to get a non urgent appointment. When i called yesterday for an appointment with a doctor I was told the first appointment with a specific doctor was 5 weeks  away, I called today and because I need to see someone I've been given a nurse appointment. Theres also been an increase in the time it takes to get medication. Previously you could get your medication when you came out of your appointment but last time it took 4 days, it does seem to be disorganised."
Mendlesham Medical,Understanding and approachable,7/15/2019,4,"Doctor is very understanding and approachable.
I am very happy with this surgery, no changes needed."
Mendlesham Medical,Useful if the dispensary was open more hours,12/2/2020,4,"It is very good if you need an appointment, no issues. It would be useful if the dispensary were open more hours."
Mendlesham Medical,Usually see own GP,9/10/2018,4,Usually get to see your own GP but if not its not a big concern as the GP's are all very good. Over time it has got busier and there is concern about the future development in the village. I'm happy to visit the other surgery but this may become more difficult when I don't drive.
Mendlesham Medical,Very friendly,9/25/2018,5,"Always get an appointment, convenient location, staff are very friendly and helpful.
A water fountain would be nice."
Mendlesham Medical,Very friendly,9/25/2018,5,"The staff are very friendly and the GP gives good explanations.
I wouldn't change anything.
I can usually get the consistency but I do have to wait a little longer.
Nurse practitioners are very good here."
Mendlesham Medical,Very friendly,9/25/2018,5,"I can always get an appointment when I need to.
Doctors always friendly, staff are very friendly.
A coffee or water machine would be nice"
Mendlesham Medical,Very good,10/17/2016,4,Fab!  Seen very quickly
Mendlesham Medical,Very good borderline excellent,3/13/2018,4,"Normally v quick to get an appointment with doctor or nurse, clinical staff appear to listen and respond well to patient need, and to follow up on concerns. Sometimes appointment times are delayed, but this is due to staff being thorough with patients and giving them time. Only negative point - no proper open surgery PPI group - a group of 'friends' does not suffice. Practice manager curiously defensive on this."
Mendlesham Medical,Very good care,7/24/2017,5,"Having the choice of surgery to attend gives you greater flexibility. I see the nurse practitioner mostly and haven't needed to see a GP for sometime. I get very good care but if she is at all concerned or unsure she will always check with the GP. We are very lucky to have the surgery, generally its a very good, excellent surgery where you can always see someone."
Mendlesham Medical,Very good surgery,5/25/2017,5,A very good surgery.  Can get appointments when needed and can arrange for my medication to be picked up easily
Mendlesham Medical,Very personal approach,2/25/2019,5,Its a homely surgery which offers a very personal approach which is very different to my previous surgery.
Mendlesham Medical,Whole team nice,2/25/2019,5,"Its easy to get appointments and staff always respond to emergencies well. All the team are very nice and approachable and I've had good medical advice over the years and confident in the care provided.  Text reminders are great, work really well. Good that there are female doctors at the surgery and have had call backs from doctors when appropriate and has worked well."
Mendlesham Medical,Works well,7/13/2023,5,"Don't find it difficult at all, sometimes when its not urgent you fit in when they have space. All staff are very friendly and everything works very well. On rare occasions its difficult to get an appointment when you'd like one but one is available."
Mendlesham Medical,Wouldn't change a thing,7/15/2019,5,"I have not been at this surgery for very long but I have experienced a positive hospital referral.
Would NOT change anything here."
Mountfarm,50 minute wait for a morning appointment,7/9/2017,3,The GP was good when I saw her and said sorry for the wait but didn't offer an explanation as to why they were running so late.
Mountfarm,A bit of a wait but lovely staff,6/18/2019,3,"There can be a bit of a wait to get an appointment, the online appointments system works better. There can be a bit of a wait once at the appointment too.
But they are all lovely here."
Mountfarm,A friendly and professional surgery,6/18/2019,4,"All are friendly and professional here. It can be a wait of up to a week if you need to see the same GP. 
I always book online unless it's very urgent and then I ring. 
On the whole I am very happy with this surgery."
Mountfarm,A very good surgery.,7/1/2019,4,There can be a bit of a wait to see the GP at times once in the surgery. There is a long wait before you get through on the phone - recently waited about 20 minutes to speak to someone. But it is a very good surgery.
Mountfarm,Absolutely superb surgery!,2/15/2023,5,"I've been with this surgery for around 5 years after moving from another one in the town.  The difference between the two has been such a surprise!  Every staff member I've encountered at Mount Farm has always been so polite and happy to help, they really do go the extra mile for their patients.  I even had to speak to the Practice Manager last year about an issue, and she was so helpful and efficient, even though she must be really busy.  Yes, there are times when their phones are really busy and it takes a while to get through, but the staff are what make Mount Farm such a brilliant practice, and they should all be commended for the good work they do!"
Mountfarm,Accommodating staff,12/20/2021,5,Even though I was late arriving due to traffic problems the staff have been very accommodating and will see me when they can. I got the appointment yesterday after speaking to reception about the problem I had and they arranged my appointment today.
Mountfarm,Admin pleasant & helpful; GP follow up great,9/29/2022,5,"On more than one occasion recently I have had to contact the surgery; reception staff have been calm, pleasant and very helpful.  Follow up calls/visits with the GP have been prompt and I cannot fault the service given each time."
Mountfarm,All works very well,7/1/2019,4,"Any referrals needed have been positive. The staff are always very polite in this surgery, there is quite often a bit of a wait to see the GP, but it's worth the wait. Parking here is good. My medications are delivered to both myself and my husband, which all works very well."
Mountfarm,Always been good,12/20/2021,5,Nothing really needs to change. Staff are very polite and lovely when they answer the phone. They are so accommodating as I really struggle to get to the hospital for blood tests but they've said I can have an appointment here which is so helpful.
Mountfarm,Always excellent,6/16/2021,5,"All reception staff, doctors and nurses very courteous and caring"
Mountfarm,Always excellent,6/16/2021,5,"All reception staff, doctors and nurses very courteous and caring"
Mountfarm,Always friendly on reception,7/1/2019,5,I'm never left to wait around - a good service. Always friendly on reception. There can be a bit of a wait to get into the surgery to see a GP.
Mountfarm,Always helpful and smiling,1/23/2023,4,"It's a good surgery and better than my old one. I did struggle when all appointments were on the phone, but now I've been invited in and generally it is easier to get an actual appointment.  When I've wanted an appointment with a specific doctor it has taken a bit longer, but that's to be expected and considering the current situation it's not a problem. It's a genuine surgery and we've been able to have house visits by both the paramedic and GPs  which was great. Whenever I deal with staff it's always been good and the receptionists are particularly good."
Mountfarm,Always kind and helpful,1/9/2020,5,Staff are efficient and help out readily
Mountfarm,Always very helpful and polite.,6/26/2023,5,"Doctors are very good, same day appointments given if needed."
Mountfarm,Amazing what they're doing,12/20/2021,5,Staff at the surgery are great 10/10. What they are doing is amazing. They are offering great support and care with the kids seen really quickly and gave good advice and explanations.
Mountfarm,An excellent surgery and team,6/19/2023,5,"I moved here last year from another Bury surgery, and have been amazed at the difference in service and standards between the two.  The staff at Mount Farm are always so very helpful and whichever department you speak to, they go the extra mile to give first class service.  I think they're all doing an excellent job in very trying times.  Just last week I was in the waiting room and overheard a patient being extremely rude to the receptionist.  The poor lady bent over backwards to try and be helpful, but the patient continued to be rude and controntational.  It must be a thankless task dealing with members of the public such as this, and they should be commended for their unfailing courtesy and professionalism!"
Mountfarm,Appointments always available,10/2/2019,4,Have not ever had a problem getting appointments or phone calls back in a timely way
Mountfarm,arrived late but still treated with considera,9/16/2019,5,I seldom need to visit a doctor but a deteriorating condition made it necessary and was given an appointment the same day. Being deaf I made an error and arrived 1 hour late the doctor still attended to me even though it was after his last appointment and the reception staff were helpful and considerate keeping me informed as to my progress to see the doctor. This is how the NHS should work for everyone
Mountfarm,Awful,7/11/2015,1,"Cut off repeatedly on the phone no response to the e consult form, no response to the reminder consult form. 4 days later I’m still trying to talk to someone"
Mountfarm,Brilliant,5/13/2022,5,Very happy with the surgery. They've always been so great with appointments available when needed. Any issues are sorted out quickly and the staff have provided great care and support.
Mountfarm,Busy phones,9/1/2023,4,The phones are busy but reception are helpful when you get through to them. I called this morning and have been given an appointment straight away so very happy with how its all worked out today.
Mountfarm,Can't fault the surgery,6/7/2022,5,"The care provided is very good and it gives you confidence. Getting an appointment has been good, nice and simple. I really can't fault the surgery."
Mountfarm,Can't fault them here,11/22/2019,5,"Nothing goes wrong here, they make you feel very welcome. I am very impressed with the doctor but sometimes the nurse is not quite so clear with explaining things. They have good clean toilets available, which is important to me wherever I go.

Mountfarm,Can't speak high enough of this surgery,7/1/2019,5,"First class service, can always get appointments as needed, responsive staff. Very impressive service. Can't speak high enough of this surgery."
Mountfarm,Care and treatment good,9/1/2023,5,"It's been good to get appointments, today's was prebooked with the nurse. The care and treatment I've had has been good, it's a great surgery. The length of the phone message is quite long and is a bit frustrating, so I tend to walk here to book appointments as we live locally.  Staff have been good, it all works well and always has, we've been here a long time."
Mountfarm,Care is good,9/1/2023,4,There have been problems getting through on the phone in the morning so I come to the surgery to book appointments when they are needed but the care is good and overall the surgery is good.
Mountfarm,Children always seen,9/20/2021,5,The children have always been seen when I've called for them and I'm completely happy with all the staff and how they are with you. The wait on the phone at the moment is a bit frustrating at times as it can be  about 20 minutes.
Mountfarm,Communication is very good,7/1/2019,4,"Communication is very good between GP and patient. I do genuinely feel they care. Getting an appointment I have found to be usually okay, but you do have to wait for a while before you are called into the GP room."
Mountfarm,Cut off after 20 minutes on the phone,7/12/2021,1,"Waited 20 minutes, first in line and cut off."
Mountfarm,Do a very good job,12/20/2021,5,"Its all good, they run a wonderful service. The staff are all so wonderful, polite and helpful and they do a very good job."
Mountfarm,dp - good,7/5/2016,4,y ratings would have been 5 star before my original doctor left.  My care since for mental health has not been so good.
Mountfarm,Drs and nurses all very good,12/20/2021,5,I don't feel there is a problem getting an appointment when I need one. I would like to be able to book a blood test at the surgery online as it would be easier but the doctors and nurses are all very good.
Mountfarm,Easy to get appointments,9/22/2016,5,"I've had no issues getting appointment, in fact its easy to get them when you need to. Overall it's a good surgery that I feel supports us well."
Mountfarm,Econsult works well,5/13/2022,4,"I don't need to use the surgery much at the moment but when I've used econsult to contact the surgery in the past it has worked well. I called reception this morning, they were very helpful and able to book me an appointment straight away with a doctor. I'd like to be able to use the NHS app to book appointments but this facility isn't currently available."
Mountfarm,Efficient & professional,7/10/2020,5,"During pandemic saw GP phone assessment, needed to be seen , appt same day saw 2 GPs for diagnosis. PPE used  , very efficient"
Mountfarm,"Efficient, kind and polite",8/16/2021,5,"Sometime this year, I  moved from a local surgery whom I had been with for the past 20 odd years after my GP literally shouted at me for querying one of my medications and its side-effects. My husband and I decided to move and registered with Mount Farm Surgery, and from the time I have been with Mount Farm, I have nothing but the utmost respect for the reception/ admin staff and all the GPs I have been in contact with. Everyone has gone out of their way to pass my message to the duty GP and not a day have they not called me back and listened to my concerns. My husband and I are extremely grateful for all your hard work especially in these trying times; keep up the good work."
Mountfarm,Everything is pretty good.,3/12/2018,4,Everything is pretty good other than booking system. There are not enough pre-bookable appointments which gives an over use of the triage system.
Mountfarm,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"I have confidence that the reception staff know what to do and who it would be best to see for different issues. When you call the surgery they do all they can to fully understand the issues so they can get you seen by the most appropriate person. I'm completely happy with how staff are with you in consultations but I do try to see the same GP if at all possible and that's mainly to maintain some continuity. If its not possible I'm happy to see any other member of the team. I called this morning and spoke to reception, I was called back by the GP quickly and asked to come in to the surgery so for me it's been really great."
Mountfarm,Excellent,3/30/2017,5,"The surgery is very good, my doctor is particularly good,  Very gentle and calm and reassuring.  It was great that my GP helped me sort out community transport issues"

Mountfarm,Excellent,8/15/2016,5,Fantastic - I can't fault them at all
Mountfarm,Excellent - 10 out of 10!,8/20/2020,5,"What a fabulous surgery - it seems extremely well-run, and all the staff go that extra mile to be helpful and courteous.  Always clean and tidy too, and they have a really well-organised system during Covid-19. Lovely doctors and nurses too - thank you all!"
Mountfarm,Excellent and Polite,7/23/2021,5,"I was totally suffering from a severe sore throat ... rang surgery at around 5.30pm spoke to a receptionist who arranged for a doctor to call me back, this happened within 15 minutes ... by  6.00pm I was picking up the prescribed medication. Can't fault this practice's professional service. This is not the first time this practice has gone ""Gone The Extra Mile"" and made you feel like a person not a number. Thank You."
Mountfarm,Excellent service,4/15/2021,4,Friendly and professional staff all round. Clinic is clean and well managed. Covid-19 measures are in place and well enforced. Had an incredibly professional nurse conducting a routine smear test and reassuring me throughout as it is not an examination I find easy. She was great! Highly recommended. I would have rated five - my only comment is that the automated message(s) played at the start of a call are a bit long to listen to if you have to call in often but otherwise helpful information!
Mountfarm,Excellent service and care,6/24/2022,4,Staff are always helpful and caring.
Mountfarm,Excellent team,6/29/2023,5,"Always polite, caring and helpful, in person and on the phone."

Mountfarm,Fantastic and Professional,7/4/2020,5,"Mount Farm is a really top surgery with helpful receptionists, caring practice nurses and just great 
doctors ... how lucky we are to have this practice on Moreton Hall."
Mountfarm,"Fantastic surgery, helpful, clean, friendly",8/27/2021,5,"Friendly, helpful and cheerful reception staff. Fantastic Drs who go above and beyond to help. Knowledgeable and not to quick to throw medication at a problem. They listen and give you the time needed to talk. They have seen my family and I through some difficult times and have given us so much support"
Mountfarm,Fantastic!,4/8/2020,5,"Having been registered at several other local practices and not been terribly happy with the service and care I received, it was a breath of fresh air to register at Mount Farm.  Whichever member of staff you speak to, they are all really friendly, helpful and compassionate.  Feel very lucky to have finally found such a brilliant doctors."
Mountfarm,"First class service well organised, friendly.",10/17/2019,5,"Can’t speak highly enough of this surgery. I am impressed each time I visit. It is very well organised and there are plenty of receptionists who are always friendly, courteous and ready to help. The Doctors I have seen have listened sympathetically and given professional advice in a caring manner. I have always been able to get an appointment promptly. When telephoning I have always been able to get a quick response."
Mountfarm,First-rate,7/1/2019,5,"From the time you walk in the door the staff are so professional, I have no concerns at all. It's a first rate surgery, if I ever have any questions I always feel I can ask. Communication and customer service is excellent."

Mountfarm,Front desk staff very helpful,11/22/2019,5,"I have been coming here for several years and I have never had any issues with the surgery, they are good here and the front desk staff are very helpful."
Mountfarm,Frustrating at times,9/20/2021,4,The time it can take to get a face to face appointment can be a little frustrating but this isn't just the NHS. I've found that even with a child it can be tricky and getting a referral took a long time and when you're worried it isn't very nice.
Mountfarm,Full of praise,9/20/2021,5,"The doctors are great and sympathetic and I'm confident that I'll get an appointment actually with a doctor if one is needed after talking to them. The nurses and reception staff are amazing too, so helpful and friendly. I do prefer to be able to go in and talk to staff to arrange things and there is nothing like a face to face appointment."
Mountfarm,Generally I'm pleased,6/8/2016,4,Generally I am pleased with the exception of waiting times for appointments
Mountfarm,Good,9/1/2023,4,Booked an appointment online to see a GP last night and that has worked really well but I've had problems in the past getting appointments where I was told call back the next day as none were available. Staff have also been really accommodating and have booked me in to see a nurse following my appointment with the GP this morning. I've been very happy with the care provided today.
Mountfarm,Good,8/19/2022,4,It's not always easy to get an appointment and there are long queues on the phone especially first thing but generally if you need to see a doctor you don't have to wait too long.
Mountfarm,Good atmosphere at this surgery,11/22/2019,5,"There is a good atmosphere at this surgery, staff are always helpful. You do often have to wait about 2 weeks to get an appointment and it is difficult to get the consistency of the same GP. If is difficult to get an appointment when you want it."
Mountfarm,Good quality medical staff,11/22/2019,5,"I can always get appointments when I need to. Getting my repeat prescriptions is good. I make my appointments on line and this is good. Staff are very good here, they have a helpful and polite attitude. Good quality medical staff. No changes needed here."
Mountfarm,Good surgery,9/13/2022,5,"Reception staff are really helpful and really accommodating, they've fitted me in for appointments when I've needed to be seen urgently on the day. I've had my annual review and the doctors and nurses are really good too.  I have weekly blood tests and there are never any issues getting seen when needed, the staff are well trained too."
Mountfarm,Good surgery,9/13/2022,4,"Have found the surgery great considering the ongoing situation. I've had twice yearly diabetic appointments with the nurse which are always very good, they've been so good and really supportive. I was given the opportunity to take a different medication and it has worked really well. In general appointments are available and it's lovely that the staff recognise me, it's that type of surgery."
Mountfarm,GP is sympathetic and understanding,11/22/2019,4,I like my GP she is sympathetic and understanding. I book my appointments on-line and it works well. Overall this is a pretty good surgery.
Mountfarm,GP recognised I was very unwell,6/8/2018,5,My Gp recognised that I was very unwell and called patamedics. They arrived promply and took me off to Papworth hospital for emergency treatment
Mountfarm,GPs make time for you,7/1/2019,4,GPs make time for you and I don't feel rushed. You can get good continuity if you are prepared to waiter the slot. Online booking works well for me.
Mountfarm,Grateful,9/13/2022,5,It's an excellent surgery and I'm grateful for all the treatment I've had on my ulcer from the nurses. I have to visit the surgery regularly and there is never a problem getting seen.
Mountfarm,Great service and the staff are amazing!,6/19/2023,4,"It can sometimes take a little while to get through on the phone, but if you saw how busy the ladies on the front desk are, having to deal with constantly ringing phones plus a queue of people waiting to be dealt with, you'd understand why.  When you do get through to someone, they're always extremely courteous and helpful.  I've had to use the econsult and triage systems on more than one occasion, and both were excellent and very responsive.  I think the team are doing a very difficult job in challenging times, yet they always do it with a smile."
Mountfarm,"Great service, staff are very helpful.",8/4/2022,4,"As a new patient, my initial interaction with the surgery has been positive, especially under the current conditions they are having to work under."
Mountfarm,Happy to see all staff,9/13/2022,5,It's fine to get appointments and I tend to call the surgery to arrange them. I'm happy to see any of the staff and find that the whole system works well for me.
Mountfarm,Health professionals are excellent,7/25/2018,4,The health professionals are excellent but reception staff are very hostile and act above their knowledge.
Mountfarm,Helpful,9/29/2016,4,Helpful regarding appointments.
Mountfarm,I can feel a little rushed,7/1/2019,3,"I have waited for up to 45 mins before I get in to see the doctor. Sometimes I can feel a little rushed once in there. I wish I could ring up without having to listen to the long recorded message every time. Also, I am only allowed to ring for my repeat prescriptions between 12-4 and this can be inconvenient for me."
Mountfarm,I like the new triage system,10/19/2016,4,I like the new triage system as it is better to speak with a doctor over the 'phone than not be able to get an appointment at all for weeks.
Mountfarm,I wouldn't change anything,6/18/2019,4,"GPs are very good here and front desk is always very polite. I tend to book my appointments on line, which seems to work for me, but equally I could ring in and they would try to book me in from experience. I can't think that I would change anything about this surgery."
Mountfarm,Impressed with GP's,11/22/2019,4,"We are impressed with the GP's here, we are pleased with the staff who are out the front. There is a sense of flexibility at this surgery. On-line booking of appointments also work well."
Mountfarm,it has moved with times,7/18/2016,5,Having been a patient with this surgery for over 35 years it now looks after my family and has taken care of my mother in law.  The Doctors listen to their patients and support them and do not talk over them or be little them. I have GP's Surgery's nearer but would not change.
Mountfarm,It's a good surgery,6/18/2019,5,I can usually get an appointment on the day. You can get good consistency of the same GP if you are prepared to wait. I am perfectly happy with this surgery. My daughter changed doctor but soon came back as this one is such a good surgery here.
Mountfarm,Lovely staff,6/7/2022,5,"Always found the staff lovely, reception, doctors and nurses. I've been called in for my annual review and was given a choice of appointment times and days which was great. This surgery really does brilliantly."
Mountfarm,Miss continuity of care,12/20/2021,4,"There are long waits on the phone when calling first thing so I tend to use econsult and within an hour I got the call back and now have an appointment for today, so it's all worked very well. They've always seen my daughter the same day we've called but I would prefer to see my GP if at all possible."
Mountfarm,Mount farm surgery sooo helpful x,8/26/2021,5,Receptionists are always pleasant and helpful. Drs and nurses are so caring and i feel like i’m being listened to. Great job done by all the staff during COVID.. ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR YOUR SURGERY xx
Mountfarm,never had a problem,9/11/2019,5,"Phone in, Get appointment, Get seen, not a problem as long as you don't mind seeing different doctors, and they are all good, so that not a problem....."
Mountfarm,Never heard a bad word,1/22/2019,5,"I work in supported housing. I manage a team that helps people with learning disabilities, autism or ADHD live as independent a life as they are able. People that we support are able to make their own appointments and attend the surgery, often unaccompanied, and I have never heard a bad word said about any of the staff there. Great place!"
Mountfarm,No complaints,9/14/2018,4,"A triage system is in place for appointments and overall I am very happy with this surgery, no complaints"
Mountfarm,No difficulties,9/1/2023,4,I prebooked today's appointment with no difficulties and I'm happy to see any of the staff. I'm seeing both a GP and a nurse for different things and have no issues at all. Reception staff are helpful when trying to sort issues out too.
Mountfarm,No issues getting appointments,6/7/2022,5,I either pop in or call the surgery to book my appointments and the friendly staff are helpful and generally very good. They do what they can to sort things out and get what you need when you need it and do it well.
Mountfarm,"No service, did not even ask my name!",6/2/2023,1,"I have been with this practice since it opened but was given the run around by the receptionist!
What has happened to the health service? I only wanted to see a doctor about suspect blemishes on my face and ear. I have tried to book on line as suggested by the receptionist but have been redirected to phone the surgery, this will bring me back to square one!"
Mountfarm,Not community minded,8/23/2019,3,"Lymphoedema Support Suffolk has repeated requested that a poster giving information about LSS is displayed on the community notice board.  LSS meets the in the Community Centre next to the surgery.
Despite several requests by both LSS and others, no poster has been displayed or LSS contacted to say why the surgery is unable to display such information.  Other support groups have their information displayed at MF Surgery."
Mountfarm,Not easy to get appointments,9/1/2023,3,"Its not easy to get appointments as the phones take a while to be answered and there is no mention of where you are in the queue. It seems there are different systems as sometimes you are told where in the queue you are, others it say ring back because they are busy and then it cuts you off and other times it just rings.  It's just more difficult than it used to be."
Mountfarm,Not enough doctor appointments,7/1/2019,3,I find it a bit frustrating when I have to make a doctor appointment they are not able at the same general working hours. 8-5pm. It's always a nightmare for me to get the time off work and it shouldn't be like this. The surgery should be open longer hours to provide more flexibility for the people who works.
Mountfarm,Nurses very good,12/20/2021,5,It all works well with the triage on the phone and I've been given an appointment with the doctor. Staff are always helpful and the nurses are very good. You do have to be a little patient when calling the surgery.
Mountfarm,OK,11/15/2019,3,"From the contact i have had with the staff and doctors my experience has been good however what I find annoying is the phone system.  You call the main number and get a barage of conversation regarding changes to the system, then you go through it again with another list of options THEN you get a doctor offering you all sorts of e consult etc which all you want to do is make an appointment or speak to a human being - which eventually after a fairly lengthy wait - you do - unless you are in a queue and 3-4 people in front of you.  Why do we need to hear from the doctor why can't you do an option for that service if you want to and no have it pushed apon you ! Doesn't help when you need to get an appointment - which are often not available even online you either don't list any or have to wait for couple of weeks."
Mountfarm,Outstanding care here,6/18/2019,5,"I have recently been referred to A&E for an eye issue, I have been very impressed with the GP at this surgery. I understand that I have to wait to get into the appointment sometimes. The consistency of getting the same GP is possible when you book online is best. Outstanding care here."
Mountfarm,Outstanding in EVERY way.,5/12/2019,5,"Every member of staff here is approachable, compassionate and efficient. This surgery is very well run and a vital part of the community. Cannot praise them enough. Special praise to Dr (name removed) and (name removed)."
Mountfarm,Outstanding Practice,2/22/2021,5,Every visit I have made over the past 4 years has been outstanding. I was Senior Partner in a large Practice in Kent which won second place in Best Practice in West Kent. I have been amazed at the quality of care exercised by Mount Farm. I would have been proud to have been SP here.
Mountfarm,Outstanding surgery,8/26/2021,5,Nothing is ever too much trouble for every single member of the team. Great care and understanding is shown at all times and everyone is friendly and efficient.
Mountfarm,Outstanding!,2/11/2020,5,"Every member of staff you encounter, from receptionists, doctors and even the practice manager, are all so helpful, friendly and courteous.  I contacted the surgery with quite a minor issue, and ended up having a call from Jane, the practice manager, who listened to my concerns and was able to resolve them immediately.  Doctors surgery staff often get a bad press, but Mount Farm staff are simply the best!  Thank you for such an excellent service, right on my doorstep."
Mountfarm,Perfect surgery,9/20/2021,5,"Very good, a perfect surgery where staff are very good. I would like to see the return of being able to do online booking but do understand why it is currently disabled."
Mountfarm,Perfectly happy with this surgery,6/18/2019,5,"They always try to get you an appointment as soon as possible, if not the GP will call me back. 
I'm perfectly happy with this surgery, I have no complaints at all."
Mountfarm,Phone lines are busy,12/20/2021,4,"I rarely use the surgery but when I've needed an appointment apart from busy phone lines I've been able to get an appointment when needed. The telephone consultations have been very good and when I spoke to the doctor it was great, with everything sorted quickly."
Mountfarm,Phoned for appointment this morning,8/25/2021,5,"I phoned for an appointment this morning. There were none available, but the receptionist was really kind and helpful,& managed to fit me in. She said a Dr would phone me later in the day. This happened just an hour later. The Dr was really helpful and has now booked me a face to face appointment. Both the receptionist and the Dr were really kind and understanding."
Mountfarm,Phones are very busy,9/1/2023,3,I've tried for days to get an appointment online but none have been available. To get an urgent appointment is generally ok but for more routine issues it is more difficult.  I've had problems with my prescription over the Christmas period but this is unusual.
Mountfarm,Phones very busy,5/13/2022,4,I tried calling 61 times this morning to get through to the surgery and they are very busy but the care is great. It would be great if a Saturday surgery could be offered for people who work.
Mountfarm,Polite and efficient,7/29/2021,5,"I had an issue with my prescription. The team member who supported me, was very calm, helpful and polite. She assured me that the issue would be resolved and it was all sorted the same afternoon. Fantastic communication with other pharmacy collection areas and a very smooth experience."
Mountfarm,Polite and helpful staff,11/22/2019,5,Polite and helpful staff. It usually takes about a week to get an appointment to see a GP unless it is urgent. I wish the parking was better.
Mountfarm,"Pretty good, but sometimes a wait",6/18/2019,4,"Waiting at appointments can be quite lengthy, this is my main frustration, otherwise a very good service."
Mountfarm,Really good support,9/20/2021,5,Reception staff are very good and offer support and help to sort issues out. We've only recently moved to the area but the process of joining the surgery has gone really smoothly down to them. Brilliant.
Mountfarm,Really impressed,9/20/2021,5,"Really impressed with how staff have been, they are lovely. I had to call about something and the receptionist was lovely, so understanding and non judgmental. The doctor I see is also great, I've never had to chase anything up they've been brilliant."
Mountfarm,"Really well-organised surgery, even in covid",3/11/2020,5,"I've been with Mount Farm for years, and have had nothing but excellent care and service throughout that time.  They should be especially commended for how well organised they are during Covid.  There's a really good system in place, so if you do have to go to the surgery, you still feel safe.  The staff continue to be friendly and helpful, even while working under difficult circumstances. Well done to all at Mount Farm, a really excellent surgery!"
Mountfarm,Reception is good,6/18/2019,4,Reception is always good. Book online works for me but you do have to wait to see the same GP. I would like to be able to see the same GP each time in an ideal world.
Mountfarm,Regular ear syringing,5/5/2021,1,"Ears syringed usually every 6 months at MFS. At the moment MFS are refusing to offer this service, only in exceptional circumstances. Ears last syringed in November 2020. Was advised to seek private ear syringing at Boots - they do not offer such a service in Bury St Edmunds. The Hearing Care Centre does and co-incidentally has a contract with MFS to provide hearing aid services out of MFS. Extremely concerned at what other basic health care provision MFS is no longer providing and/or is seeking to cut.

[Healthwatch Suffolk note: The surgery website carries a notice about this change. See www.mountfarm.com/ear-syringing/]"
Mountfarm,Responsive caring staff great support,8/4/2020,5,Just wanted to record my thanks to the fantastic team at Mount Farm who have been absolutely there for me over past month as I struggled with a respiratory infection and asthma. The online service and video consultation absolutely amazing prescription team asthma nurses reception and of course docs thank you all.
Mountfarm,See you quickly,9/13/2022,5,It's a good surgery and they always see you quickly for appointments. Getting blood tests isn't an issue and when they say they will call you back they do. I find the phone consultations work well and often mean you do not have to come in to the surgery unnecessarily.
Mountfarm,Seen on the day - Excellent service,10/22/2021,5,"I spoke to a receptionist mid morning with concern about my son.  Even though they didn't have any  appointments left for that day when I described what was going on she spoke to a colleague to check.  I was contacted via telephone within 30 minutes and had an appointment face to face within an hour. 
He was given a thorough examination by the emergency care practitioner and we felt reassured.
The GP surgeries are doing their best to see us all when we need to be seen in a very difficult climate of abuse from the media and patients alike.
Don't forget they have just spent months working extra shifts to deliver the vaccine.
Be kind to the receptionists and our healthcare professionals."
Mountfarm,Simply brilliant in every way!,6/8/2021,5,"I don't have to come to the doctors all that often, but whenever I do make contact with them, every single member of staff (receptionists, admin, doctors and nurses) are all so kind, helpful and caring.  I've been registered at another local surgery where this was not the case at all, hence me moving to Mount Farm.  I've recommended Mount Farm to all my family and friends as you couldn't find a better surgery to look after you!  Thank you to all the staff for being so wonderful."
Mountfarm,So helpful,9/20/2021,5,They are doing their best to accommodate phone calls and face to face appointments and they are all available when needed with the staff being so helpful. They may not be able to do things then and there but they do always get you sorted out.
Mountfarm,Staff always do their best to help you.,8/17/2022,5,"Simple one really,  but very much appreciated. I needed to make 2 appointments and they tried hard to make it into one visit for me."
Mountfarm,Staff and doctors really helpful.,3/16/2020,5,Really impressed by how they have set everything up at the moment whilst dealing with corona virus
Mountfarm,Staff are all great,12/20/2021,5,I've had no problems getting appointments and haven't had to wait long either. My diabetic checks have continued as normal so I feel its generally working very well and staff are all great.
Mountfarm,Staff are brilliant!,4/2/2019,5,I have a very serious ongoing heart condition. Mount Farm have been first class in monitoring/supporting me to self manage as much as I am able. They picked up some changes which is why I am in the unit now. The staff there are brilliant!
Mountfarm,Staff are very friendly,11/22/2019,5,"Staff are very friendly here. The surgery is lovely and clean. If you don't mind who you see you don't have to wait too long, but if you want to see a specific doctor it can be up to 6 weeks wait. I suggest you fine patients who do not turn up for appointments made."
Mountfarm,Staff are very good,12/20/2021,4,I don't always find that the telephone consultations address the issues as the doctor isn't seeing you and getting a face to face appointment does seem more difficult but staff are very good.
Mountfarm,Staff are very good here,6/18/2019,4,"It is not too bad to get an appointment, but you have to ring just after 8.30am if you need to get an appointment and this can be inconvenient for me. 
The staff are very good here.
Overall I am quite content with this surgery."
Mountfarm,Staff good,9/1/2023,4,The phones are busy and then it can be difficult to get appointments by the time you get through. Communication  between here and the hospital has been difficult and I've had to start over with a new blood test this week as things weren't done when they were needed. Staff though are good and have helped to sort it all out.
Mountfarm,Such helpful caring receptionists and doctors,5/19/2023,5,"I have visited the surgery a couple of times recently which is unusual for me.  The first point of contact either by phone or visiting the surgery is the receptionists.  The receptionists are really lovely, so helpful and kind.  They take their time with you to try and direct you to the appropriate person.  I have had a telephone appointment with two different doctors both phoned the same day after me talking to the receptionists. The doctors were helpful efficient and I felt they had a genuine caring approach towards me.  A follow up appointment was booked and I cannot fault the service.  I have confidence in the doctors at the surgery and I am so happy to be a patient there,"
Mountfarm,"Such wonderful staff, great premises",10/23/2019,5,"The staff are so friendly and welcoming, and really seem like they want to help you.  The doctors and nurses are always professional and caring, and I really can't rate the entire surgery highly enough!  Mount Farm is a great example of the ideal doctors surgery!"
Mountfarm,Superb,7/1/2019,5,"I think this surgery is superb. Receptionists are always so polite, as well as good service from doctors and nurses. I am very happy overall with this surgery."
Mountfarm,Superb surgery,12/20/2021,5,I called first thing this morning and got straight through. The doctor called me straight back and I was given an appointment straight away too. Doctor and reception have been very good at explaining everything and I'm really content with how it is all working. It would be nice to have a bit of background music in the waiting area and it would be great if some minor surgery could be offered in addition.
Mountfarm,Superb!,12/21/2020,5,"Such a pleasant surgery to be registered with - the staff are all so friendly and helpful, and the doctors and nurses are really caring.  I moved from another local surgery and can honestly say that Mount Farm is so much better.  Really clean and well-organised too, especially during Covid.  A first class surgery - thank you!"
Mountfarm,"Superb, very well-run practice!",8/13/2020,5,"I don't have to attend the doctors all that often, but when I do, the staff are always so helpful and friendly at Mount Farm, like nothing is too much trouble.  It seems an incredibly well-run and organised practice, and all the staff seem well-trained, and genuinely happy to help the patient.  The website is easy to use, and I really like the new e-consultations. They regularly update their Twitter too with what's going on, which was really good especially during Covid.  Fabulous, friendly, first class!"
Mountfarm,Surgery has been brilliant,6/18/2019,5,"I have to admit this surgery has been brilliant over the time I have been coming. The consistency of the same GP is important and I can get that here.
I think that the administration mechanisms and technology is causing things to be potentially impersonal and I don't want the older folk in the community to potentially become marginalised as a result of technology either, just for the sake of making life easier for the surgery."
Mountfarm,System works well,5/13/2022,4,The phones are very busy but the system in place works really well for me and I'm happy to speak to the doctor on the phone and then have a face to face when necessary as it saves unnecessary visits to the surgery.
Mountfarm,The appointment allocation system is useless.,6/15/2023,1,"Every time I try to make an appointment it is always a nightmare. Waiting to speak to an actual person takes upwards of 20 minutes only to be told there are no appointments available - never quite sick enough to be seen. Cannot get an appointment for anything non-urgent as they never have any future appointments available to book. And although the e-consult service is a great idea and has worked for me previously, on this occasion it terminated the consult and instructed me to call for an appointment but couldn’t actually get an appointment when I eventually spoke to a receptionist."
Mountfarm,The best doctors in Bury St Edmunds!,2/11/2020,5,"The doctors and nurses are always so caring and helpful.  The ladies in reception are all really friendly and go the extra mile, unlike in a lot of other surgeries.  When I've had to call other departments, they've also been helpful and professional.  We are so lucky to have such a wonderful surgery in Bury St Edmunds - thank you to all the staff for making it so."
Mountfarm,The best surgery I've ever used.,6/19/2023,5,"All of the reception staff are super helpful and friendly - they are very thorough and extremely compassionate too. 

Also, all of the Nurses are great, and superb doctors too.  I've even had follow up phone calls  to check how things are.  What a service!"
Mountfarm,The best team nurses and doctors alike.,12/2/2021,5,"If not for the team at Mount Farm I possibly might not be here ,I cannot thank you all enough ,from the friendly receptionists to the Brilliant nurses and Doctors ."
Mountfarm,The girls on the desk are brilliant,11/22/2019,4,No real issues but trying to get an appointment is like trying to get the crown jewels. The girls on the front desk are brilliant. I do think they all do their best here.
Mountfarm,The surgery is outstanding,6/18/2019,4,"Consistency is good. Can get an appointment on the day. Attitude of staff is high, very helpful which is good particularly as I am a new patient. The surgery is outstanding."
Mountfarm,Unable to speak to Doctor,6/2/2021,1,Phoned to follow-up a conversation from 3 weeks prior but was unable to speak to a Doctor.
Mountfarm,Unhelpful,5/2/2020,1,"Daughter phoned the surgery to either make an appointment or to get  repeat  prescription, was given a call back from a doctor only to treated in a disrespectful manner and refused medication. Trying to resolve with practice manager but left  feeling like they back their own. Still to try and resolve but in the meantime no medication!"
Mountfarm,Usually I am really happy but not this time!,1/20/2017,3,"My toddler is asthmatic and regularly needs dissolvable oral steroids when he is wheezy.

My toddler refuses the steroids as they taste horrible. The last GP agreed and said they are commonly described as tasting like bile. I know that there is an alternative form of steroid in the form of a sweet flavoured chewable tablet. I rang the GP and asked for a different form as I have to pin my son down and keep my hand under my son's chin so he is forced to swallow it. He then proceeds to vomit and I need to redo the whole thing and get more steroids prescribed. I requested the alternative form this morning again and I was informed that I couldn't have it as it is too expensive. The GP said perhaps a pharmacist at the hospital might prescribe it as they can cover the cost but Mount Farm can't. I struggle to accept that I can't access medicine for my child although I have a friend who can access it at a different GP surgery in Bury. I would happily pay the difference if this was an option."
Mountfarm,Very good,9/13/2022,5,I like the triage process as I find it works well and I have no complaints about the surgery at all. Staff will bend over backwards for you and I really like the new phone system which offers call backs as you don't have to hang on the line until you become first in the queue.
Mountfarm,Very good care,5/13/2022,4,The care is very good however I am finding it difficult to get a face to face to discuss my health conditions. Everything is done by phone at the moment which I understand but its not really addressing the issues I have.
Mountfarm,Very Good GP,11/22/2019,4,"My GP is very good, I do have to wait a while if I want to see the same GP though, I wish that was an easier process, but if you don't mind who you see they will usually fit you in quite easily."
Mountfarm,Very good in general,9/1/2023,4,"In general its a very good surgery but appointments are not always available when they are needed. Today I've spoken to a doctor and now I'm being seen. The phones are busy and I've spent up to 45 minutes on the phone trying to get through but today was quicker. I do feel that more clarity is needed to prevent patients calling the surgery unnecessarily when they are unclear on the processes, things should be explained well in the first place. For example when you miss a call back, what should you do."
Mountfarm,very good local practice,10/18/2018,5,This surgery pretty well serves the housing estate that I live within (Moreton Hall) and as such is a very good local practice. Thankfully I don't have to go very often as I am in reasonable health but I value the practice and wouldn't want to have to go elsewhere.
Mountfarm,Very happy,9/20/2021,4,Very good -  very happy that the referrals I've needed have been quick and I've been referred on to both the hospital and AHP well. I would like to see the return of being able to book my own appointments online  but I can understand this has stopped at this point.
Mountfarm,Very helpful,12/20/2021,5,All staff have been very helpful as I only joined the surgery fairly recently. I've had no issues and its all been very good so far.
Mountfarm,Very helpful and friendly,5/30/2020,5,Good! No complaints
Mountfarm,Very helpful and reassuring,3/11/2018,5,My mother was (and is) registered here and they allowed her to stay on their list when she moved slightly out of Bury to be closer to us. The service is very helpful and reassuring and we value that they are prepared to come and see her when she is poorly.
Mountfarm,"Very pleasant exception staff, nurses and GPs",1/22/2020,5,My most recent experience was for a flu jab. Whilst the queue was long it moved quickly and the nurses were good humoured and efficient
Mountfarm,Very pleased with surgery,9/20/2021,5,"Very rarely need an appointment but when I do it works well. I normally just need to pick up my medications which are done quickly, therefore I think its great and it seems to work well."
Mountfarm,Very well organised and supportive,7/7/2020,5,I had to seek advice for a worrying lump that appeared - I was spoken to with such care by the receptionist and there followed a call from GP who organised to see me promptly. She kept me informed of her plans and was thorough in her investigation of the cause.
Mountfarm,Very well organized especially due to covid19,5/27/2020,5,"My Dr has been very helpful over the last few days, as well as all the reception staff. I would just like to say thank you for all you are doing especially in these difficult times."
Mountfarm,"Wonderful team, great premises, first class!",12/24/2020,5,"GP surgeries often receive bad press, but the whole team at Mount Farm are incredible!  Nothing is too much trouble, and whoever you deal with, doctors, nurses or receptionists, they're always polite and friendly.  I was especially impressed by all their Covid-19 measures - I had to visit the surgery when I was unwell, but I felt completely safe whilst there.  They have a really good entry system and the staff were all protected behind screens and wearing masks.  I saw several members of staff cleaning whilst I waited too.  The people of Bury are very lucky to have such a fantastic and well-run surgery on their doorstep -thank you all!"
Mountfarm,You can request a GP to call back,11/22/2019,5,I've never had any need to complain here. The reception staff are very helpful and the GP's listen well. You can get a doctor to call you back at home if you need that service. On the whole you can get an appointment if needed but you do have to wait a while sometimes.
Mountfarm,You can tell it's a lovely practice,9/13/2022,5,"It's a very nice surgery and operates very efficiently.  You can tell by the practice staff it's a lovely practice. It's exactly what you'd expect from a good surgery.  Mum has had difficulties having blood taken so we now see a specific member of staff who manages well and that is easy to arrange. I like the call back option on the phone but I wasn't sure if it had worked as it appeared I'd been cut off, but it did it would just be nice if you could get confirmation that was happening before being cut off."
Mountfarm,You won't get better than that,11/19/2018,5,I was feeling unwell and I was experiencing 'flashing' in my left eye so I 'phone the surgery at about a quarter to ten. I was told to come in to the surgery and I was in front of a GP by twenty past ten. I don't think I could have got there any quicker so you wont get better than that!
Needham,1 hour 56 mins to get through on the phone.,3/4/2023,3,"I called at 08:30, number 19 in the queue. I had to wait 1 hour 56 minutes to get through. You cannot send a message to the surgery because the online option has been permanently turned off. There is no ask my GP service. You cannot go into the surgery to make appointments. The waiting room is deserted. The staff are kind though, it is just a shame that this service has not been given the support it deserves."
Needham,1 Week wait for appointment,1/24/2020,2,"One week wait to get an appointment, The GP and nurse have been excellent. I was told by reception staff on the phone that I could be referred for a MRI scan by my doctor but I am unsure. I went to A & E with a back issue and I asked for an MRI scan and the doctor I saw said I needed a scan but they would not give me one at that time so I am back at the GP today to see if I can get one. I have also self referred to AHP physio team in the hope that they can refer me also for a scan."
Needham,1h 30m regular time to get through in phone,7/15/2021,1,"1h 30m regular time to get through in phone, and they shut phone lines at lunch, when workers have the opportunity to ring the surgery. Rude reception staff."
Needham,3/4 hr on phone,6/3/2023,3,"I recently spent 3/4hr on the phone waiting to speak to reception. The ongoing issues make it very difficult to get to see anyone but it's not surprising when they've lost so many staff. It's all just very difficult, getting through and then getting seen."
Needham,4 days wait to even get a call,2/8/2022,2,"I understand that services are stretched, but feel 4 days just to speak to someone after putting an E-Consult in, is ridiculous. They may contact me sooner, but that is the message you get. I am not tied to my phone, and with it being school holidays, we will be out and about a lot. The inquiry is also something I would not be comfortable talking about in front of anyone else. The surgery states on the telephone message that 'the quickest way to get an appointment is to use E-Consult.' and when I rang that is also what reception said. It is a real concern if 4 days is considered 'quick.'"
Needham,A friendly surgery,4/8/2015,5,"I am yet to experience any problem with obtaining appointments to see a doctor when needed. The only issue is with, sometimes, not being easily able to get through to book but perseverance will usually get you through eventually. 

Every doctor I have seen has been pleasant and seems interested in me as their patient. I have never felt rushed out of the door and the advice offered has been reasonable with follow-up offered where appropriate. Receptionists have always treated me courteously and have a friendly manner."
Needham,A good surgery,1/9/2016,4,"A good surgery,  I don't have any problems getting appointments"
Needham,A really great doctor,4/29/2015,5,I recently had an appointment with my GP she was absolutely great. If more doctors were like her there wouldn't be as many grumbles. She spend time with me and reassured me about my concerns.
Needham,Acceptable,8/24/2019,4,"Econsult used successfully. Accept that staff often face restrictions out of their control. 15-20 minute wait for an appointment is acceptable, but there is always a knock-on effect,"
Needham,Accomodating,1/16/2019,4,"Pretty helpful on the whole, accommodating when you call. You do get to see your own doctor mostly which is good and helps with continuity. Its difficult to get appointments, if you have something urgent you can be seen but if its a routine issue its more difficult and can take time to get an appointment. I tried recently to book an appointment for a routine issue but the doctor was away and I couldn't be seen until they returned. I've also waited in all day for a call back but the doctor called at 7pm when I'd gone out"
Needham,All terrific,4/14/2016,5,All terrific and are angels
Needham,Always accommodated.,8/24/2019,5,"Receptionists are outstanding in person and on the phone. GP is wonderful. Often have to wait a long time, bit the outcome is good. Quite prepared to wait. Phone experience is good now we know how far in the queue we are. Always accommodated."
Needham,Always been well looked after,12/16/2015,4,I have always been well looked after
Needham,Answering the telephone,8/11/2019,3,"When I called at 8.30 a couple of weeks ago I was 17th in the queue and it was answered within 10 minutes.  Today I rang at 2pm (ish) and I was 2nd in the queue for 6 mins and 1st in the queue for a further 3 mins.  I just find that frustrating.  My call was non urgent (asking about Flu clinic dates) so I left it until later in the day. It would be good if you could book your flu slot online as I use E-consult here all the time, but the form is so long I did not use it to ask for a flu jab.  I also use the 'patient access' link on the surgeries website and have book a GP appointment though that, but again, you cannot book a flu jab on it."
Needham,Appointments are a challenge to get at times,1/24/2020,4,Sometimes it is not easy to get an appointment and I have to wait too long on the phone to get through but it is a good surgery overall.
Needham,Appointments/blood tests are always late.,2/5/2017,4,"With all the new housing going on in Needham, how will the surgery cope with extra patients? Also at the Bildeston surgery they have a number system in the mornings where by you can see which ever doctor you want, just take a number and wait in a queue. Afternoons are for longer appointments. Much better system."
Needham,Asked to use E-consult but does not work!,7/9/2020,3,"I had a text today from the surgery stating that my Asthma review is due. The instructions were to go on to E-Consult, go to the A-Z then Asthma Assessment, then fill out a questionnaire. Well, Asthma is non existent on the A-Z. I have put a query in to their Admin as I called the surgery and they are closed for training this afternoon.
It is very frustrating that you get asked to follow a certain procedure but it does not work. These things should be tested. I cannot be the only patient experiencing this issue if this is now the way of doing things."
Needham,Better if appointment could be coordinated,1/28/2019,4,It would be better if appointments could be coordinated as it would make it easier to access the appointments. Only having two disabled parking bays can make it difficult to park and non blue badge holders park in the spaces.
Needham,Bit of a wait for appointment,1/28/2019,5,Once you get an appointment the advice and service was very good but it's a bit of a wait to be seen and can be up to 48 hrs.
Needham,Booking appointments is good.,8/24/2019,4,"General experience of booking appointments is good. 20-30 minute wait is usual. Some communications on delays would be useful. Some concerns regarding medication reviews. Not thought to be regular enough, particularly if extra medications are introduced. Would be keen to see a notice board with day to day updates."
Needham,Booking appointments is very difficult,7/3/2019,4,"Nice surgery, music, books, environment is lovely.
The booking of an appointment was very difficult - 40 minutes once I got into the waiting queue."
Needham,Brilliant,8/24/2019,4,"My doctor is brilliant, but he is running late today.I""ve been waiting for 40 minutes so far. I do find the online appointment booking a bit frustrating."
Needham,Brilliant doctors,8/15/2018,4,"All the doctors I've seen have been excellent, giving good care and support. It is difficult to get through on the phone in the morning and booking in advance is difficult too."
Needham,By and large good,7/3/2019,4,"My experience, by and large, is good.
Very happy with the staff here.
I am very happy with the GPs - I wish more doctors were available.
I don't use the internet so can't make use of some of the things available here."
Needham,Call backs don't happen,9/14/2022,2,The triage system doesn't work as you are told they will call you back but it doesn't happen. They are obviously very busy and individually there are some great staff but when they don't do what they say they will it gives you little confidence in the system.
Needham,Call backs work well,8/8/2018,5,"Like the appointment system, its always better to be able to book in advance but I don't have difficulties normally. Staff are pleasant and the surgery is nice, light and airy. The dispensary staff are helpful and will sort issues out quickly. I do like to see my own GP as he knows me and whats going on. Having the call backs from my GP works very well too."
Needham,calls,6/3/2023,2,"When I called recently on a Monday morning I was told that they don't take calls on Monday's so not sure what you do if you're ill on a Monday.  I've been trying to get an appointment but nothing is face to face any more.  I had a visit from a doctor, not from the surgery and they were very good."
Needham,Can be a wait on the phone to get through,8/8/2018,4,"Having the dispensary on site and the delivery service for medication from the pharmacy is good. It can be a bit of a wait on the phone to get through in the morning but it's not too bad. It would be nice if some how the surgery could explain how systems work, ie I didn't realise that a prescription could be collected straight after seeing the doctor. May be the phone message could direct people to the website for explanatios. Reception staff and all staff really are very good and try to make things as easy as possible."
Needham,Can get appointments,8/2/2019,5,"Seems very good, I can get appointments when needed, for routine issues it can be about a week and a half to wait which is fine but when we've needed an emergency call back they've been very good. Call backs for general issues are also done quickly and issues sorted."
Needham,Can get same day appointments,8/2/2019,4,If you really need one you can get an appointment on the same day which is good.
Needham,Can normally get appointments with my GP,8/2/2019,5,"I can normally get an appointment with my GP, I called this morning and got an appointment straight away. The Dr does run behind but you are not rushed in you're own appointment and expect them to run a little behaind. Its a good change to have the queue system on the phones, it works much better."
Needham,Can't plan ahead,8/2/2019,4,"It's very busy today, but I didn't feel rushed out of my appointment. I seem to be in and out quickly but other people seem to be in or need much longer. Its difficult to plan ahead when you work because you can't book ahead especially if you are trying to see someone specific."
Needham,Can't see a doctor,5/28/2016,1,Can't see a doctor unless it's your own and they are never there or available. Staff are rude and waiting time can be hours. My test results took weeks to be available instead of days!
Needham,Car park needs to be bigger,8/24/2019,3,I try to ring and cannot always get through. The car park needs to be bigger.
Needham,Car Park Too Small,1/24/2020,4,"Car Park is too small for the demand. You sometimes do have to wait quite a while to be seen at appointment but this is variable, I have children and they always give me an appointment on the day when I ring up. It is difficult to get through on the phone. It is good to be situated close to the pharmacy."
Needham,Care and support good,8/15/2018,4,"Like the online system for ordering prescriptions, it works really well and means I only have to visit the pharmacy to pick up my medication rather than drop the paper copy off at the surgery. Care and support at the surgery has been great the only thing is that I'm often given a blood test appointment for very early in the morning but I can't get here until 9.45"
Needham,Care good,8/15/2018,5,"I visit regularly and appointments are booked weekly for me, the care has been good and I'm quite happy with them. I can have a laugh and a joke with the nurse I see."
Needham,Care good but difficult to get appointment,6/7/2017,3,"Getting to see a doctor especially your own is very difficult, you are often told to call back the next day. Care is good however."
Needham,"Care good, carpark busy",8/15/2018,4,"The car park is very busy and it is difficult to park, on occassions I have parked on the housing estate and walked in. The care is good, staff are friendly but it can be difficult to get through to reception because it is so busy forst thing in the morning . The call waiting and the music that plays are both improvements though."
Needham,Care is good,8/8/2018,5,More often than not you can see the same GP but even when you don't the care is good and staff all seem quite friendly. I do tend to visit the surgery to book an appointment as the phone line is so busy and I don't have the internet.
Needham,Care is good,9/27/2022,4,"My GP is fabulous, the care is very good, it's just getting an appointment that is an issue."
Needham,Caring doctors,8/15/2018,4,Staff are very good and doctors are caring and supportive. Waiting times to be seen can be a bit long but you get the time you need in your appointment. I've used the new online system afew times and it has worked well and I'd use it again.
Needham,Caring service,1/20/2022,5,caring service from reception through to paramedic / gp that i saw
Needham,Continuity has been very important,1/9/2016,3,MY GP is only on 2 days a week.  If I want to see her I have to plan.  She is excellent.  There is a problem that referrals can't be made by other doctors.  The locums have been great over the years.  Continuity has been very important and I like seeing my own GP.
Needham,COPD review done by phone,9/29/2022,3,"I've just been contacted by the surgery to have my COPD review by phone which I don't understand. They asked me to take my own blood pressure, either at the surgery or at home but is there help at the surgery to do this as I don't have a machine at home.  I believe that for some issues face to face appointments are important and I'm concerned about the lack of face to face appointments. I don't understand how a review of my COPD can be done like this when I've always needed to be seen before, they won't be able to do the checks they used to do."
Needham,Cost £7 to get through to the surgery,9/29/2022,3,The cost of trying to call the surgery is not good. It cost me £7 to call the surgery recently due to having to wait on the line so long. When I did finally get through the option I wanted wasn't available.
Needham,Cost of calling is a concern,6/3/2023,3,"The cost of calling the surgery is a concern as you can be on the line so long waiting to get through. It is then hard to see a doctor, I used to be able to see my own GP but not anymore.  I don't feel my regular reviews are taking place when they should and when I have asked to see someone, I've reluctantly been given an appointment with a nurse.  Getting a blood test here is difficult and the cost of getting transport in to Ipswich is very difficult especially as I was having to go regularly."
Needham,Could have been better,10/14/2021,2,"I arrived [ten minutes early] for my appointment. I was not seen until [half an hour after my appointment time]. It wasn't until i asked at the desk if they knew how long it was going to be my name then came up as soon as i sat back down. Funny that? It felt like I had been forgotten about. I haven't got much time to be able to leave work and to have to wait 30 minutes to be seen when i have a slot booked is not acceptable, especially in covid times when you don't want people to be in the surgery for any longer than they need to be. When i was checking in, the receptionist was really welcoming, however, [infection control procedures] need to be looked at. They turned around, took their mask off and sneezed without covering their mouth, I was very shocked. As for the phone lines, well that seriously needs looking at, 30 minutes on hold. EConsult, couldn't find the form on the website. Such a shame Claydon and Barham surgery has closed, easy to contact, easy to book an appointment"
Needham,Diabetic blood checks not done regularly,12/16/2015,4,"Diabetic bloods twice a year. I moved from Torquay 21/2 years ago, appointments were posted me regularly on date due. This year I have had to ring and ask for my appointment which is now much later than they ever used to be and not regular."
Needham,Difficult getting through on the phone,1/24/2020,3,My doctor has always been very good I cannot fault him. It is a good surgery but it is difficult getting through on the phone so I often drive up and make my appointments face to face.
Needham,difficult to contact the surgery,6/3/2023,3,It's just hard to contact the surgery and when I have got through I've been told to call back the next day as there are no appointments available.  Once I've been able to see someone the staff have been brilliant but it is very hard at the moment.
Needham,Difficult to get an appointment,8/15/2018,3,"On the whole the surgery is very good. It is difficult to get an appointment and this is the first time I've seen my GP in a long time. I've tried the new online triage system but it didn't work, I received an emailto say the  issue could be dealt with by phone but I missed the call. When I called back I was told someone else would call but I did feel that for me it didn't really work. Not seeing my own GP isn't an issue as the duty doctors are good. To get a pre bookable appointment has never worked and the online appointments are so limited it doesn't help either. If its something hospital related I would prefer to see my own GP."
Needham,Difficult to get an appointment,8/8/2018,3,"Very difficult to get an appointment and see your own doctor, you can be asked to call back tomorrow. Nurses have been very good, chatty and put you at easeplus they run to time. I don't like sharing information with the reception staff about the reason for my appointment and they can be a bit abrupt at times."
Needham,Difficult to get appointment but brilliant dr,9/1/2017,2,"Have to ring at 8.30 to get an appointment and press redial for up to 1/2 hour. By the time you get through all the appointments are gone. There are some really brilliant doctors at the practice its just a shame how difficult it is to see anyone. 

When my prescription was ready the doctor sent it over to the chemist but when I went to pick it up it hadn't come through on their system. People with paper prescriptions were coming and going but I had to wait until it finally came through."
Needham,Difficult to get seen,6/2/2023,3,It is difficult to get to see a GP as most issues are dealt with over the phone which I understand is done more now and does work in a lot of circumstances but its not for everyone or all issues.
Needham,Difficult to get to see doctor,6/22/2018,2,I was asked by my doctor to see them in two weeks time but reception couldn't give me an appointment as none were available. People are queuing outside the surgery to get appointments more easily so if you try to get through on the phone in the morning it is very difficult. People who have no transport or live outside of Needham Market are then disadvantaged as they can't get to the surgery to book an appointment. I was given an appointment in the end.
Needham,Difficult to see own GP,8/2/2019,5,"At times the surgery is really good but getting an appointment is difficult espeially if you want to see your own doctor. Coming to the surgery often makes it easier to get an appointment. This morning they've arranged for two appointments at the same time for us and we didn't even request it. My doctor is very good, even if running late you don't feel rushed. The message on the screen saying there were 20 minute delays was good and the new check in system worked well and was easy enough to follow.  Parking is a problem, may be some of the areas that are landscaped could be used to increase capacity."
Needham,Difficult to see same doctor,8/8/2018,2,"Difficult to see the same doctor which then impacts on the care received. You ring up and could be 26th in the queue. The online system is set up to benefit the GPs not the patients, so coming in to the surgery is limited by these systems. The car park is small and needs improving, land has been sold for housing. The practice is quite heavily reliant on locum doctors which means you never see the same doctor."
Needham,Difficulty getting an appointment,12/16/2015,3,I wanted an appointment with a doctor but was told there were none available until Friday of next week. I wasn't asking to see a specific doctor.
Needham,Disability not always understood,6/7/2017,3,I need to speak for my husband on the phone as he is deaf but different react in different ways. Some won't allow me to speak on his behalf whereas others are more understanding. The care provided by doctors and nurses has been great.
Needham,Discontinue of repeat prescription practice,6/27/2016,4,"For twenty years I have needed repeat prescriptions for my ongoing health conditions. The quick and easy way for me has been to phone the Needham Market Pharmacy who place the order to the surgery. This has always been efficient and safe. I do not wish to use electronic means, and taking the paper prescriptions to the surgery means yet another visit. I therefore hope that once this trial project runs its course, the telephone system to the pharmacy will be reinstated."
Needham,Do a good job,1/28/2019,5,A professional and pleasant surgery where they do a good job. More or less you can get an appointment when you need one and staff are accomodating with appointment times and help to get you an appointment for when you're not working. I'm quite happy with the surgery.
Needham,Doctor I'm seeing is very good,7/8/2018,4,Usually you can get an appointment on the day you need one but not necessarily with your doctor. The doctor I normally see is very good and thorough.
Needham,Doctor really listens,7/8/2018,5,"The doctor I see is very good, she is so friendly and approachable and really listens. The only issue is that it can be difficult to get an appointment with her so you see other people. Parking is an issue but you will eventually find a space."
Needham,Doctors supportive,1/9/2016,4,"The doctors are very good and supportive.  It is much easier to get an appointment by queuing,  For older patients it would be better if patients are checked regularly as they don't want to bother the doctors."
Needham,Down hill,10/19/2022,1,"No longer want to see patients or have any contact with them. Told not to call unless an emergency and to use eConsult system instead. Tried to contact today, only to see a note on their website that now says sorry we turn off eConsult now. So how exactly am I supposed to contact? Am now trying to contact by phone and have been on for 20 minutes and still only number 20 in the queue. Once you do finally get through, the receptionists are rude but you don’t say anything in case you get to find another surgery. Appalling. Did not use to be like this. Never had a problem getting an appointment and all staff were helpful and polite."
Needham,Dr  is the only good thing!,3/13/2018,2,"Very difficult to get an appointment, always behind, receptionists very unhelpful, made to feel an inconvenience, parking is terrible (particularly for the disabled), continuous errors with my repeat prescription. HOWEVER, one Dr. is absolutely brilliant, thorough and trustworthy."
Needham,Dr saying extremely irrelevant things,5/1/2017,3,"A locum saw me with my son.  He asked what I and my husband do for a living and I suggested I am married to a woman,  To which he said ""So you are the husband!""  To which I said ""No, clearly  I am a woman"".  He then referred to my son and said ""You do know that he can contact his biological father when he is older""
I was horrified as I was there for my son's health (temperature of 41 C) and this doctor was saying extremely irrelevant things"
Needham,Drs and nurses are good,8/2/2019,4,They always have my prescription ready on time. It can be a little hit and miss to get a routine appointment. You can be told there are no appointments but you are then offered a call back. Depending on how ill you are you can have a discussion with staff about the different options available. Staff are nice and quite helpful and the doctors and nurses are good but it would be nice to be told if the appointments are running behind. Even when running late they will still spend time with you.
Needham,E-Consult is excellent,2/19/2019,4,I used the online E-consult form and got a call first thing the next day offering me an appointment with my own GP.  I feel more people need to know about it and use it.  I would be interested to know how it is dealt with the other end as my call was at 8.05am and the phones at the surgery do not open until 8.30.  I just find it interesting to understand what the labour is for these things and if it does cut down on the need to see a GP if some people only need to go to a Pharmacist ETC.
Needham,E-Consult made no sense,7/9/2020,2,"Went through the E-Consult for a leg issue. When I hit a 'yes' to one of the answers it told me that I needed to seek urgent medical advice by calling the surgery or 111.There is no option then to still submit the form, you have to either go back and say 'no' to the question so you can then submit it, or you have to click on the statement that says something like 'I will seek my own medical advice' (this has a statement with it that says that if you do that, your GP will not be made aware of it. How ridiculous is that?!)
 The issue then was that the surgery only is allowing appointments through using E-Consult, so even if you call the surgery it will then insist you use E-consult or the receptionist will take you through E-consult! It does not make any sense!"
Needham,E-Consult worked well for me,1/11/2019,5,"I used E-Consult due to developing problems with pressure and pain in my ear. 

Completed the required fields, which took only a few moments and was informed that I would hear from the practice the next working day before the surgery closes. I received a call in the morning (at about 9.30am) inviting me to book an appointment with the Nurse Practitioner in the afternoon, which I did. I found the whole process to be simple and efficient (much better than hanging on the phone lines in the morning).

I turned up for my appointment and had to wait for maybe 20 minutes or so. Appointments do sometimes run late in this practice but I do not see that as a negative thing at all - I have never felt rushed out of an appointment and I have always been treated with professionalism and care. That, for me, is worth a short (or sometimes slightly lengthy) wait in the waiting area.

The Nurse Practitioner was exactly the right person to see. A fairly severe ear infection (possibly with a ruptured ear drum) was diagnosed and a course of treatment prescribed. A follow-up appointment has also been made. I found her to be friendly in approach and the information about the treatment was good.

At this point, I have complete faith in this surgery and hope that will continue into the future for myself and also my family. Thank you."
Needham,Excellent,7/3/2017,5,"Usually you can get an appointment when needed.  They are a pretty good surgery.
My husband has regular INR testsand the nurses have been brilliant"
Needham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Extremely lucky.  They have been very good.  They will deliver medication which is very useful.  I have regular blood tests but these are all done at the surgery which is great
Needham,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,You always get an appointment.  The new locum at the surgery is really good; they listen and understand so are great for this family.  It works well for us.  Having the extended hours appointments is great for my husband who can't get away from work easily
Needham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Brilliant surgery - always availability for an appt.
Very kind and understanding with children"
Needham,Excellent care - getting appointments hard,10/17/2016,5,"Care is very good at the surgery but getting appointments can be very difficult.  Have very limited contact with staff as all automated , but when you do they are good"
Needham,Excellent GP,11/27/2020,5,I've never struggled to get an appointment. I have seen the same GP for nearly 3 years - he always seems to remember me and my history which is reassuring. I am never rushed or made to feel like I am wasting his time. He shows genuine concern and takes my views into consideration when treating.
Needham,Excellent Midwife!,6/12/2015,5,We cannot thank our community midwife and assistant enough for the good experience we had throughout my pregnancy.  It felt like she was 'looking out' for us as human beings rather than just being clinical. Once the baby came she was the support we needed and we miss seeing her.
Needham,Explain things well,7/8/2018,5,"Its a clean surgery, staff have all been very good, they explain things well when its needed. Its difficult at times to get through on the phone but generally I do get to see my own GP which I do like."
Needham,fair,6/21/2016,3,Took my daughter for a lunch time appointment so she didn't miss school but we ended up waiting an hour to be seen
Needham,fair,6/21/2016,3,I have had a prescription review noted on my repeat form for the last 3 months but can't get an appointment to get it reviewed.  I put the repeat in online each month & it just does get re-issued.  I would have thought past the review date this would be flagged to the GP who keeps signing it off.  Why put a review date on the form if it is not being implemented?
Needham,Fair. Can get appointments but staff can be unfriendly.,4/18/2017,3,Sometimes some staff are not very friendly but generally I can get appointments when needed.
Needham,Fairly good but difficult to get appointments,12/13/2017,4,"Getting an appointment is difficult, on the whole you are not offered any other choice of help and just have to ring back the next day. The care is generally quite good. They are definitely better with the children."
Needham,Fine here.,8/24/2019,4,"One of the doctors can take a bit of an unwelcome tone with one of my grandparents, but on the whole it is fine here and you don't have to wait more than 15 minutes before you are seen."
Needham,First Class Service!,1/24/2020,4,"They have looked after me brilliantly, I get first class service and I get to see the doctor that I want to. It just takes too long to get through on the phone. We spoke about Econsult and I have used this before and had a positive experience so maybe I need to try again."
Needham,Flu Jabs,6/12/2020,4,"Had Flu Jabs booked on Saturday, so well organised, amazing set up. Well done Needham Surgery and Thank you."
Needham,Friendly and thorough,10/18/2022,5,"The receptionists very very friendly, call was anwsered within 10 minutes. I gave symptoms and was added to a doctors list. I was called back 20 minutes later and asked to attend a face to face appointment with a doctor the same day."
Needham,Friendly staff,8/2/2019,5,"Staff are always friendly and prescriptions are always ready and waiting, if anything isn't available they get it in really quickly. The doctor I see is very good, really got things moving when I had problems and referred me straight to hospital. The parking is an issue but there's little scope for more. Even if an appointment isn't available they will always get the GP to call you back but this is rarely needed as appointments are generally available when you need them."
Needham,Frustrating trying to get help,11/24/2022,2,"For the last month I have been trying to get a proper conversation with someone who knows more specifically about my condition. I was told by reception that I can speak to anyone of the GP's, however they give you no specific guidance. I was told that I needed repeat bloods which are not accurate for my condition I wanted input on, but as last ones had shown low Iron levels they wanted that checked. However, this was not seen urgent enough to get a test done that week at the surgery (needs to be put through as 'urgent') so in the meantime I had to be signed off work as I am unable to function well. They did not talk to me about that, they just sent an email with the sick note attached! Now the bloods have been done a prescription, again with no conversation was put through. It was good that is was done very quickly, but as I am taking other supplements to try help myself, I would have liked a phone call. I went to put an E-Consult in on the day the prescription was sent at 8:05 to me to ask for this conversation, but E-consult was switched off already. Every day this week E-consult has been off when I have looked to try use it at 8;00. They say to use E-consult so not to add pressure to the phones, but it is not even on! 
I have now spoken to 4 different GP's about this issue (I say spoken, I mean I had 1 'out of hours', 1 call a few days later, 1 who issued the sick note (not chat) and one who issued the prescription (no chat)).
The frustration is that I want to sort this so I can be at work and functioning better in daily life. One conversation with someone who knows about things better is all I would like, but it just seems to be the hardest thing to get."
Needham,Frustrating!,4/28/2022,3,"I went onto the GP’s website, to be told there that I needed to go to the e-Consult website. I duly went to that website, only to be told it was closed and to go to my GP’s website! We are told not to phone, so how are we supposed to contact them? I gave up in the end after going backwards and forwards between the two, thinking it was something so was doing wrong. I’ve since found out quite a few others have had the same experience. 
In the past I’ve always been perfectly happy with their service."
Needham,Generally good,2/26/2019,4,A bit more of a delay today compared to normal but its generally a good surgery.
Needham,Generally good but difficult to get through.,3/27/2015,4,"My experience of this practice has been generally good. I have always been able to get an appointment on the same day of calling. Furthermore, when I have needed some advice from a doctor, a call back has always been possible. 

The main problem that I have experienced is getting through on the telephone. At one point, I had to redial 51 times before somebody answered and I was able to book an appointment.

I have found all of the doctors friendly and my treatment has been good. I have always felt that I have had adequate time in my appointment to talk to the doctor, ask questions and be advised."
Needham,Getting an appointment can be tricky,10/24/2016,4,"Getting an appointment at times can be tricky especially if you want to see a specific doctor.  The prescription delivery service is great

Somersham surgery"
Needham,getting appointments is difficult,7/25/2016,4,When they see the doctors they are good but getting appointments is really difficult.  Getting through before all the appointments are gone is a rea problem and they just say phone back tomorrow
Needham,Getting appointments is hard,7/3/2019,3,"Getting an appointment, ringing up is very difficult. I can be on the phone waiting for over 40 minutes only to be told there are no appointments left and I have to wait until the following morning.
Otherwise it's a good surgery."
Needham,Getting through on the phone is difficult,1/8/2018,3,It's okay but getting an appointment is difficult and queueing at the surgery is the best way to get an appointment as getting through on the phone takes a long time.
Needham,Getting through on the phone takes time,1/9/2016,4,Getting through on the phone takes time and you are often told no appts are available.  Once you are seen they are very good
Needham,Good,3/2/2021,5,Efficient
Needham,Good,8/24/2019,5,"Have found consult very good. Disappointed to be waiting over an hour for an appointment for my child. But I was able to combine two appointments last time, which is good."
Needham,good,10/10/2016,4,If you call and speak to a GP they will always see you
Needham,good,10/10/2016,4,Good
Needham,Good but getting appointments hard,10/17/2016,4,Trying to get a doctor's appointment can take anything between two to four weeks
Needham,Good but hard to get quick appointment but communications with hospital poor.,4/5/2017,4,"Very difficult to get a quick appointment.  Having the notice to say where you are on the call list is an improvement as you know whether it's worth staying on the line,  Always will do a telephone conversation.
Notes are not shared well between the hospital and the surgery.  You have to make sure you copy letters etc. and pass them on"
Needham,Good but improvements could be made,1/8/2017,4,Some improvement could be made.
Needham,Good but reception staff a barrier,10/17/2016,4,Reception staff are the first point of call but they act as a barrier when you try to book an appointment
Needham,good care is given,8/17/2016,5,No faults in the service. Getting through on phone is difficult and it is easier to queue but overall the care given is good.
Needham,Good Communication,1/24/2020,5,"All so helpful, I know they are busy but they are so good. Staff very polite and could not be more helpful. Surgery communicates well when doctor or nurse is running late.I have no complaints."
Needham,Good diabetic care,12/13/2017,4,I like the surgery but trying to get an appointment is the only downside. They have been great at keeping on top of my husbands diabetic care.
Needham,Good overall,4/9/2015,5,Pretty good service other than quicker appointments would be good
Needham,Good staff,2/4/2015,3,Receptionists and gps always do their best to help but I am often called in 40-60 mins late for my appointments. I also find it strange that they do not have baby changing facilities at the practice. I switched midwives during my pregnancy last year as I found the first midwife based at this practice not to be very informative
Needham,Good Staff Attitude,1/24/2020,4,They always seem to fit us in with an appointment. The staff attitude is very good. Sometimes you can wait longer than 20 mins to see the doctor and it is difficult to get through on the phone but when you do get through they do seem to find you an appointment.
Needham,Good support from GP,12/16/2015,5,"Our GP has written letters for my son who has a learning disability, so that we get seen promptly by the consultant at the hospital."
Needham,Good surgery,4/5/2017,4,A good surgery .  I really like my GP; they have been great during a very difficult time.  The only problem is getting through on the phone but I do like the new system that tells you where you are in the queue
Needham,good surgery,8/17/2016,3,My GP is good although I don't get to see them that often. I rang recently for an appointment but couldn't be called until after lunch. After speaking to the GP they diagnosed over the phone + arranged for medication to be left out. The delivery of medication is good and very helpful.
Needham,good surgery,8/17/2016,4,A good surgery. I don't have any problems getting appointments.
Needham,good surgery,8/17/2016,4,"The surgery is good, I don't go very often but I'm pleased with the service. Explanations given by the doctors are good but I will ask questions too."
Needham,GP Listens Well,1/24/2020,4,"Sometimes the lady on the phone can be a bit abrasive with her tone, it is only one the others are lovely. I am impressed with this surgery overall. My GP listens well."
Needham,GP Outstanding,1/24/2020,4,"My GP is outstanding, I love my doctor. However getting access to the surgery is quite difficult, when I do eventually get through they do usually find me an appointment. I am happy with the surgery and they are fantastic with my kids too."
Needham,GPs are good here.,8/24/2019,5,"If I ring up I always find they fit you in. The GPs are good here. Staff are lovely. I noticed the wait to get through a bit shortened today. 10 minutes wait is fine, I can feel a bit rushed sometimes, but I wouldn't change anything."
Needham,Great locums over the years,8/17/2016,3,My GP is only on 2 days a week. If I want to see her I have to plan. She is excellent. There is a problem that referrals can't be made by other doctors. The locums have been great over the years. Continuity has been very important and I like seeing my own GP
Needham,Great service,7/13/2023,5,"Very friendly reception team, appointment booked on the same day"
Needham,great surgery,9/28/2022,5,Very caring and professional receptionist who took my details. I was called back by a nurse practitioner within 45 minutes
Needham,Happy with everything,1/28/2019,5,They are good at making sure I get help when I need it and the staff are nice and explain things well. I can get appointments when required and generally call to make my appointments which can take a little time to get through but thats to be expected. It all works very well.
Needham,hard to book appts,8/17/2016,4,"To get an appointment, it's difficult to get one ahead but on the day has become a bit easier. Online booking and system is really good and is easier than phoning. The parking is a problem. On the day appointments mean that you can't plan ahead."
Needham,hard to get appointments,8/17/2016,4,Getting through on the phone takes time and you are often told no appts are available. Once you are seen they are very good.
Needham,Helpful and attentive,1/9/2016,5,I get to see my GP all the time. She listens well and is very attentive. Reception staff are very helpful.  Car parking is difficult and further spaces would help
Needham,"Helpful, kind, respectful, professional",7/10/2015,5,"Available appointments. Prompt referral for my breast, availability of telephone appointments for support during chemotherapy. Kindness from all at the practice - nurses, receptionists and my GP. Only criticism I have is the lack of availability of a safe area to wait while on low immunity on chemotherapy."
Needham,Home visits hard to get,6/3/2023,2,I joined the practice over two years ago and I've not seen a doctor in all that time and my medication hasn't been reviewed. I've also had problems getting a home visit.
Needham,I am happy with the care I receive.,10/24/2016,4,"Somersham branch.
I'm happy with the care I received but getting past the receptionists can be a bit difficult: some can be more abrupt than others.
Getting an appointment can be difficult at times.  Prescription delivery is great.  This time when we were trying to get our blood tests booked the receptionist was great and arranged for us to have the tests done at the same time.  
The dispensary is really marvellous and the delivery service is really helpful.
There has been an occasion when an issue was raised with our GP but its taken a long time for any action to result"
Needham,"I feel safely cared for, thanks all.",10/11/2022,5,"Amidst stressful times for the practice, I’ve found all staff to be kind & courteous.  The care I’ve received has been thorough and the team experienced, knowledgeable and compassionate. Appreciated."
Needham,I love my doctor,7/16/2015,5,I love my doctor - They are awesome.
Needham,I really like my GP,1/9/2016,4,I really like my  GP.  They are great.  Getting an appointment can be difficult at times.
Needham,I wait outside for an appointment,7/3/2019,5,"I come down and wait outside to get an appointment.
I would prefer if the GP could call me in as the digital screen can be a little difficult for me to see."
Needham,Impressed with GP,1/24/2020,4,On the whole this surgery is pretty good. I am very impressed with my GP. I always drive up and book my appointment face to face with the reception staff as it takes too long to phone in. I can usually get an appointment quite easily.
Needham,Inconsiderate reception staff .,4/28/2022,1,Never get to see a doctor as receptionist decides if you can or can't.  Phone system is a shambles you get a missed call from doctors then when you phone back your like number 25 in a queue so you give up . Never any appointments but waiting room always empty so where are all these patients.
Needham,INR appointments difficult,8/15/2018,4,It is difficult to get an INR appointment although this has got a little easier recently but generally its a good surgery.
Needham,INRs difficult to get,8/15/2018,4,Staff are very friendly. You can't get through on the phone so I tend to visit the surgery to book appointments as it is easier. INR's are very difficult to get and its often suggested that I should go to Ipswich for it. I've also had difficulties accessing my notes online and can't see them at the moment.
Needham,Inspire confidence,8/15/2018,4,"They are very professional, they take time to explain and keep me well informed and inspire confidence. Getting appointments can be tricky and if using the automated system there are often no appointments available and getting through to reception is also difficult as its so busy. I did use the online system but it wasn't overly intuitive but I got there in the end."
Needham,Known for delays,8/24/2019,2,"Would appreciate knowing how many patients proceeded own appointment. Own doctor only works 2 days a week, and is known for delays to appointment time. I have used econsult successfully."
Needham,Lack of appointments,6/3/2023,3,When I've called the surgery it can be a long wait on the phone and when you get through you can be told to call back the next day when there are no appointments left.  I asked a doctor for help around my wellbeing and was told I could've found the service I needed myself but I didn't know where to go or who to trust. There are also a lack of blood test appointments available which means I have to go up to Landseer Road which is both costly and difficult to arrange.
Needham,Lack of efficiency,4/8/2022,3,"I recently submitted feedback to say how the E-Consult states that it will be 4 days before they contact you. However, they contact me the same day. It is however bizarre that a service states it will be 4 days and then by 1pm turns the system off as they have 'reached capacity', but then get back to you the same day. (Mixed messages).
The text I received did not give me enough information so I had to submit another E-Consult. They responded stating that my GP was now on leave but another GP would make contact. I received a text from a different GP, which started with P.S. so that made no sense, so I did another E-Consult. In meantime I received an email with more information on (which probably was sent before the text, but I had not seen it). So, I sent another E-consult to apologise! The surgery team then rang me, which was good as I then managed to have a conversation with them as they asked if I was happy with what had been decided. I was confused about the issuing of medication without a chat with the GP, as it states you take it 3 times a day for 5 days max, whereas GP has said 4 times a day. Nothing mentioned about side affects. Also the alternative medication that was stated that I could also have, I actually would prefer initially (without mentioning my condition this is hard to explain). So now, I have had 4 E-Consults, 2 telephone calls and now 2 prescriptions issued which I feel could have been resolved if the first time I contacted the surgery I got to talk to someone for 5 minutes! I cannot see how that is more efficient in the longer run! It is also stressful for me to keep chasing and this back and forth!"
Needham,Like the doctor calling you,8/15/2018,5,More or less you can get appointments when you need them. They are busy and it can take time to get through on the phone but it is not too bad. I like that they doctor will call you to discuss things but its not suitable in all circumstances.
Needham,Long wait on phone to get through,7/3/2019,4,"I had to wait in the system for an hour this morning to get to speak to reception.
I may try to use e-consult in the future but it's not a replacement for the GP."
Needham,Look after me,6/1/2017,5,This is a very friendly and helpful practice-they look after me very well.
Needham,Lost faith in this surgery,7/3/2019,2,"I have lost all faith in this GP surgery and if I could I would change surgeries. Just before we went on holiday my wife, who is diagnosed with dementia, was taken off her water tablets by the GP and her legs began to swell. We got home on the Friday and I was so concerned I called 111 and then I took her to A&E on Saturday, paramedics took her into hospital and they kept her in."
Needham,Lots of queuing and waiting,7/3/2019,3,"I was held in the queue for 29 minutes this morning before getting to speak to someone.
E-consult has been used by me twice. 
waiting for over 25 minutes before being called in to the surgery is not uncommon.
Thankfully I don't need the GP lots, but only think I would like to see is better appointments."
Needham,Lucky to get an appointment,10/20/2016,5,You are lucky if you get an appointment.  It just depends when you get through.  The staff are amazing however
Needham,Massive delay in referral,3/3/2020,3,"Back in October 2019 my GP asked us to bring a joint statement in from SENCO & ourselves. We did this and accompanied it with a letter. January 2020. I contacted the surgery to ask when referral had been done. They couldn’t tell me but said they’d ask GP. I had a telephone call from one of the office team who informed me the GP would now sort it. So I asked ‘so are you telling me that it hasn’t been done? And without my call today it still would not have been done?’ She said ‘Well your GP has been busy’. I understand that my GP is busy but 3 months! What I’d really like to know,is when did my GP actually receive my letter? Did it sit in a tray for weeks? My GP had told me that referrals take a long time to access the service, and he is usually so vigilant so this took me by surprise."
Needham,Mixed experiences,4/29/2015,4,I had issues when using the nurses as I told each of them that I was allergic to plasters but when they treated my wound they each used plasters. This made the situation worse and I felt ignored. On the other hand my experience with the doctors has been good and even when my own doctor is not available the doctor has been great.
Needham,More reception staff to answer calls needed,7/3/2019,5,"I had to wait for 46 minutes before I got to speak to someone this morning. I did get an appointment today, however I will take a look at e-consult. 
My GP is excellent and the dispensary is very good
I think they need more staff to respond to calls in the morning."
Needham,More thorough,6/16/2023,4,"I submitted an E-Consult first thing and got a ring back about 4pm. This is now the 6th person I have spoken to about the same thing in the last few months. This was another locum and I had to repeat everything again that had happened so far.
I would say the questioning was more thorough and I felt more informed about my choices. I had not had that before and chosen medication that now I was told to stop immediately due to the new side affects. The GP warned me of how this could affect me in next few days. They put a referral through and made it clear what to do next in what order."
Needham,Mostly good,7/3/2019,4,"My overall experience has been good and the reception staff are friendly and professional.
There was an issue a couple of years ago that I've never forgotten, I came in for an ECG wand I was very apprehensive. The nurse left me uncovered and exposed, it left me feeling a lack of dignity. People are holistic and the e-consult is never a replacement for face to face."
Needham,Mostly see the same GP,1/28/2019,4,"Normally the appointments run fairly on time, generally I can get appointments when I need them and mostly see the same GP. I've never had any particular issues or problems."
Needham,My GP is good,1/9/2016,3,"My GP is good although I don't get to see them that often.  I rang recently for an appointment couldn't be called until after lunch.  After speaking to the GP they diagnosed over the phone and arranged for medication to be left out,  The delivery of medication is good and very helpful."
Needham,Never had poor service,8/24/2019,5,I've never had poor service here. I came in to see the receptionist this morning and she was able to find me an appointment late morning. Excellent service.
Needham,New online assessment great!,1/14/2019,5,"I was aware of this new service only because a friend told me about i, so I feel they need to communicate it better to their patients for those who can access the internet. I have always found getting appointments difficult and so felt that this new assessment online, may be a good way to get a response.
On a weekend recently I felt unwell after my cough changed to feeling more like an infection/bronchial, 
I filled out the form on their website (Sunday evening), which was very thorough.  On Monday at 8.05 am I had a call from the surgery receptionist asking me to attend an appointment with my own GP that day.
On the form you can put that you would like to preferably see your own GP, but have the option to put 'any' as well.
I will use the system again if need be as I found it worked really well. I had no idea if I needed to see a GP or not, so it is good they are able to assess that and treat accordingly."
Needham,New patient,9/29/2022,5,I've only had one appointment with a nurse she then spoke to the doctor and a referral for a scan was done for me. She explained what would happen and why it was needed. I only had to wait 3-4 weeks for the appointment and it was great that the confirmation text explained how to cancel if I needed to.  I do like that you don't have to go in to the surgery all the time and issues can be sorted out online or by phone.  Reception staff were helpful arranging things too.
Needham,New phone system is an improvement,8/15/2018,4,The new phone system at least tells you where you are in the queue and you can do other things while waiting which is an improvement. Generally everything works well and I see my own GP most of the time.
Needham,Nice atmosphere,1/28/2019,4,Friendly and helpful staff create a nice atmosphere. Normally you can see the same doctor which is important to me but you can't always get an appointment as quickly as you'd like. The call backs from doctors work nicely and you're called quite quickly which is good. It is easier to come to the surgery to book an appointment than to try getting through on the phone first thing in the morning.
Needham,No appointments available,9/14/2022,1,No appointments are available and doctors do not phone you back as expected. As a result I've now changed practice.
Needham,No appts,12/13/2019,3,"No appts ever available. Reception staff never seem to understand what I request, which I feel is simple to find out
E consult is average."
Needham,No complaints,9/14/2018,5,"Staff on reception are fine, though one can be a bit short.
No complaints at this surgery."
Needham,No faults in the service,1/9/2016,5,No faults in the service.  Getting through on the phone is difficult and it is easier to queue but overall the care given is good.
Needham,No problems with prescriptions,2/9/2015,4,I receive my regular prescription on a Tuesday and there are no problems with what I receive.
Needham,Not seen a doctor or nurse,9/29/2022,3,I joined the practice during covid but I've never seen a GP or nurse. I thought that as a new patient I would be seen but this has never happened and the referral my old practice did has not been followed up. Inititally I had problems getting my prescription sorted but it took three months to get the correct medications arranged.  I've also not had a medication reveiw since I joined either.
Needham,Nures are great,7/8/2018,5,A briliant surgery. I don't see the same doctor but this doesn't worry me. The nurses are great and it doesn't take long to get through on the phone either.
Needham,Nurse's are very good,1/24/2020,3,"Can have to wait in the surgery for up to an hour before you are called through, it would be better if they advised you on arrival that they are running late at least you can be prepared then, The Nurse Practitioner and also the practice nurse who has been dealing with my asthma are very good. Car Park is too small."
Needham,Nurses do home visits for me,12/16/2015,5,The nurse comes out to me to do my regular blood tests. She also arranged for me to have a specialist anti bed sore mattress.
Needham,On the day appointments mean you can't plan ahead,1/9/2016,4,"To get an appointment ahead is difficult but on the day has become a bit easier,  Online booking system is really good and is easier than phoning.  The parking is a problem.  On the day appointments mean you can't plan ahead."
Needham,online and call back service inconvenient,7/28/2021,2,"filled in the (very limited characters) online form to be informed that I needed to speak to a doctor directly.  called reception and was promised a callback which I missed due to not being able to sit by my phone all day long.  Tried to return the call, but reception was closed and no follow up call received the next day despite a voicemail on my phone to this effect. No face to face appointments offered."
Needham,Online appointment system,10/15/2015,4,"I've been set up for the online service where I often order my repeat prescription. However, on there, there is the option to book appointments, but when you try to do it it won't let you and says to ring the surgery.The surgery must pay for this system and making full use of it surely would help not clog up the phone lines of people ringing in for appointments (advanced ones,as I doubt the system would ever allow 'on the day' appointments)."
Needham,Outstanding,6/16/2020,5,"Phoned surgery at Midday, gave description of problem to receptionist who then flagged this up to Duty Dr immediately.    Within 5 mins I received a call from the doctor, to say that medication had been issued for me.  The diagnosis by the doctor was spot on as 1 week on I have fully recovered."
Needham,overall good service,8/17/2016,5,"I get to see my GP all the time, she listens well and is very attentive. Reception staff are very helpful. Car parking is difficult and further spaces would help."
Needham,Phone disconnects,3/25/2022,2,"I tried to put an E-consult in this morning (Friday 25th March), but when I answered one of the questions it said that I had to call the surgery to seek an urgent appointment that day (the E-consult says you will get a response by next working day, so clearly the system viewed my symptoms as needing urgent attention).
I therefore came off E-consult and rang the surgery. This was around 11am. I was 8 in queue. When I got to no1 it cut me off. I rang again and was 6th in queue. I got to no1, the music changed and all I got for next 5 mins was a music loop with no voice saying I was a certain number in the queue. The system clearly was experiencing issues. As E-consult also said to call 111,  I then did that. I got a call back at 4pm only to be told I'd get another call back which happened at 8pm. They cannot book me into the surgery so was advised to ring surgery Monday. Just an absolutely frustrating process and all because a phone system was not working properly. Thing is I had no way of telling surgery about the issue as you are not even allowed to walk in."
Needham,Phone waiting times really bad,8/1/2021,1,I waited 46 min for someone to answer the when the line went dead and said it’s their lunch time. Next time I waited 40 mins for them to get doctor to call me urgently the receptionist hung up before taking my details to contact me back then called back and on call doctor had gone home at 5 pm. I had been in hospital having a district nurse come out and needed more antibiotics I then had to wait over 24 hours untill I see district nurse who helped me lots
Needham,Polite and friendly,4/28/2022,5,No issues at all
Needham,Poor,12/13/2019,1,Missing meds for a week chasing and chasing to get them waiting 3 hours for a phone call back try to get help from reception who try to blame me for being rude when I need reassurance making my anxiety worst and feeling like I will have no Meds over the weekend.
Needham,Poor dealing with ongoing prescriptions,7/16/2015,3,Poor at dealing with on going prescriptions/ chronic illness.  No acceptance of errors or effects of errors on patients.
Needham,Proactive and friendly,2/12/2020,5,"My doctor has recently followed up on initial contact made through NHS 111 and the out of hours service. The integration between the services was impressive. I received a phone call to follow-up on the advice of the OOH doctor (I did not need to contact the practice to follow-up), which included a referral and a blood test. I was advised about how to book the test and the reason for that test etc. The test results have come back and I have been advised by text of the outcome with advice. All very quick and efficient. I felt the doctor was friendly in approach and allowed sufficient time for discussion about my concerns. I often feel that way about this practice and long may that continue."
Needham,Proactiveness questionable,6/23/2023,3,"After going for a scan that I got really fast after a referral (within 3 days), the service said that if I do not hear from surgery ring them & suggested 7 days max. I rang is E-Consult was already switched off and not fit for this purpose of asking for follow up. Reception were pretty good and kind and said they could see my scan results were in. I did ask if I could speak to same GP that had done the referral. They booked me a ringback for 2 days time as that was the next day this GP was in.
GP told me my scan results and stated I needed another referral for further investigation. They literally said to me 'did you not know you had.......' Er no. Sorry, but how do they expect me to know when it is them that referred me to investigate in first place.  It bothered me that I had to chase them for this, and it needed 'action'. I therefore wonder how proactive they really are and if I had not chased them, would it have gone on and got worse.
I also do not understand how this was not picked up only a few months ago when I had a similar referral. They had said something small was there, but 'nothing to worry about.' Yet in a few months here we are! Why was that small thing not looked at then? I am trying to process this and worried and do not have a huge amount of confidence in my surgery for the potential ongoing treatment I may need."
Needham,Problems making appointments,7/8/2015,3,"Main problem is making appointments, I've made one this morning but its two weeks away. But normally when we ring up, there are no appointments today please ring back tomorrow. This keeps happening. My husband was ill, I couldn't get hold of a doctor. The appointment system needs looking in to. My husband has regular blood tests, the surgery doesn't have anyone to do it any more and he has to do a 40 mile round trip to the hospital. Its very expensive."
Needham,Rate the GP very highly.,8/24/2019,5,I do rate the GP here very highly but the GP is only available for two days a week. I usually wait 30 mins before the appointment which is frustrating. I never feel fobbed off or rushed. I prefer to book appointments face to face.
Needham,Real and approachable,8/24/2019,5,Doctors and receptions staff are very real and approachable. I use consult and I would prefer to use it rather than ring up. This surgery exceeds all others I've been to.
Needham,Really good,8/15/2018,5,"I think they are really good, if you need an emergency appointment you'll get one. The GP I see is so lovely, sympathetic, has a sense of humour and is so understanding. There can be a queue on the phone and at times there are no appointments available when you do get through."
Needham,Referral wasn't made,12/16/2015,4,My husband needed to be referred to hospital for treatment but after waiting months I went in to check what was happening only to be told that the referral had not been made. Once you get to see your doctor he is really good. I too was referred by my GP to see a consultant but I had no explanation about who or why I was going.  When we looked it up the issue we were concerned.
Needham,Reviews overdue,3/21/2023,2,"I keep giving up on the telephone as it takes so long. No 30 in the queue. Cannot use online as it is always closed. I am due for some reviews that are now overdue by 3 years. I understand the loss of time due to Covid, but now it has got ridiculous. They have not contacted me, like they used to, to tell me I am due. As a very elderly person with some difficulties, so this is just very challenging and frustrating situation. These reviews are in place for a reason, and so it is worrying that they go by the wayside."
Needham,Rude and disgusting service phone call.,7/28/2020,1,"On Monday the 27th I phoned the Practice to book an appointment with my GP. To be informed that I needed to book an e consultation. I duly completed the e consultation and received a phone call 4 hours later from a Locum Doctor. I explained my position, history, condition and concerns to him at length. He refused to give me an appointment without first having blood tests conducted. He also informed me that my kidneys are defective which was the first that I knew about that condition. I said I would be contacted by a Nurse so I could book an appointment for my blood test. I phoned the surgery again today at lunchtime as I had not been contacted. The receptionist informed me that the Doctor had not processed the request, which was why I hadn’t been contacted.
I am appalled that a Practice that has exemplary full time staff with an outstanding reputation like Needham Market Country Practice should be employing someone like the individual that I spoke to? 
I now have a blood test booked for the 11th of August but still no appointment with a GP. I have found this experience very negative and harmful to my health. As a Veteran I am not agitated easily but this is causing me major concern."
Needham,Rude and unhelpful,4/12/2020,1,Having called numerous time to be left in a queue for ages got to number one and surgery put phone down on me. Also having now called have had abnormal test results and doctor has yet to call me to let me know. Now have to wait another week for doctor to call me. This is not what you should expect from your doctor. It's bad enough not being able to see them face to face. Where is the duty of care
Needham,See own doctor,8/15/2018,4,You can phone on the day and get an appointment with your own doctor which is good. It all runs quite well to time and the care has been good.
Needham,Seen on time,1/28/2019,4,"You're normally seen on time when you are waiting in the surgery but its difficult to get appointments, this latest appointment has taken two weeks to get."
Needham,"shocking, took over a week for a response",10/12/2019,1,took over a week to respond to an econsult request
Needham,Sign in waiting room helps,6/7/2017,4,Having the sign in the waiting room that shows the name of the next patient really helps me as I am deaf. I need my doctor to look at me when we talk.
Needham,So many barriers to access,3/30/2023,2,"As the online system is not open at 8 am when I could put in an E-Consult, I try and ring at 8:30am but I have the school run and have to drive. I have 10 minutes window. It is rare that I can get through before I leave the house, so have to hang up. I try again when I come back and by the time I do they say all appointments for that day have gone and to try again the next day. It's ridiculous. They need to have E-Consult open as it just feels like there are so many barriers to getting access to someone to help."
Needham,Sometimes difficult to get appointments,7/8/2018,5,Sometimes difficult to get appointments on the phone but staff are generally good and its a satifactory surgery.
Needham,sometimes hard to get appointment,8/17/2016,4,I really like my GP she's great. Getting an appointment can be difficult at times.
Needham,Sometimes I have to wait,6/30/2015,5,Sometimes due to the number of patients the nurses get a little behind and I have to wait.
Needham,Sometimes you have to wait a while,7/3/2019,4,"They are helpful on reception and always try to give appointments.
I now know more about e-consult and will have a look.
Sometimes you do have to wait a while before you get to see the GP"
Needham,"Staff are excellent, waiting is fine",7/3/2019,5,"I am very happy with this surgery, the staff are excellent - if you have to wait a bit it's not an issue.
I can get an appointment on the day if I need it.
No complaints."
Needham,"Struggle to get appointments, care is good eventually",6/15/2017,3,I struggle to get appointments at the surgery.  You ring in the morning and by the time you get through all the appointments have gone because local people go to the surgery to book their appointments as it's easier to get appointments that way..  Care is good once you see someone
Needham,Struggle to make an appointment,12/18/2019,1,"Telephone line busy, queues out of the door, receptionists like police interrogators. A typical Monday morning at Needham Market Country Practice.

Online services for requesting repeat prescriptions overnight, without warning. Replacement app not updated in over 4 years by the developer.

Telephone request for repeat prescription goes missing.

GP works part-time, runs late and difficult to get appointments with."
Needham,"Supportive, kind and caring team.",10/11/2022,5,"I have always felt very well cared for as a patient and this continues, even throughout the difficulties the practice is having with limited staff and doctors. I was appalled at the treatment reception staff received from patients during my last visit and I was only in the waiting room for 10 minutes. I will never understand how people can speak so rudely to other human beings without feeling ashamed. 
Thank you to the whole team for your hard work."
Needham,Take too long to see...,4/10/2022,3,"....the right person. Today I had to ring the surgery as was thrown off E-Consult. I said I know I needed to see a nurse, as I knew the area would need 'dressing' as a minimum. I was told I would see the 'on the day' person. Didn't even tell me the job role. It was within 45 minutes of my call, so that part was good, but honestly, pointless! I saw the Paramedic, who got the GP in who said I needed to see a Nurse! I had to come home as they only had an appointment for a few hours later. I even asked if they could send me to the MIU in Felixstowe, but they did not. Maybe there were no Nurse appointments earlier, but as a patient it is frustrating as this will now be 2 trips to the place. Patients do know more that they are given credit for though."
Needham,Takes time to get prescriptions,6/3/2023,3,Now told it is 5 working days to get a prescription but I put my request in before I went away on holiday and I've come back and although I need the medication it's still not been done. The call backs by doctors are quick and I've been able to get appointments okay but it does all feel a lot more remote than it used to be.
Needham,The care given is good,1/9/2016,4,The care given is good and I'm happy with it.  It is difficult to get through on the phone.  When I have got through at 8.30 I've been told that I can't have an appointment until lunch or that you need to call back at 2 pmish for afternoon appts.  But the  same can happen again and they say call back tomorrow.  It would help to have another telephone line for appointments
Needham,The care given is good and I'm happy with it,8/17/2016,4,"It's difficult to get through on the phone. When I have got through at 8.30, I've been told that I can't have an appointment until lunch or that you need to call back at 2pm ish for afternoon appt. But the same can happen again and they call back tomorrow. It would help to have another telephone line for booking appts."
Needham,The print size on the web page is far too small,9/28/2020,4,The print size on the web page is far too small
Needham,The surgery is good.,1/9/2016,4,The surgery is good.  I don't go very often but I'm very pleased with the service.  Explanations given by the doctors are good but I will ask questions too.
Needham,They do well,1/28/2019,5,"They are a very helpful surgery, they are fitting me in after I fell last night and they've fitted me in before when I've had problems. The care has been good, I don't come very often but when I do they do very well."
Needham,Thinking of changing surgery,1/24/2020,3,"Machine not working at check in which is inconvenient, the surgery seems too busy. I am thinking of changing surgery. Several years ago I did not like the doctors attitude with me and I did not think that I was well examined and at that time I went private instead."
Needham,treatment is very good,8/8/2018,4,The doctors and treatments received are very good. Getting through on the phone is very difficult and often there are no appointments available.
Needham,Trying to get an appointment,10/15/2015,4,"The surgeries telephone lines and doors don't open until 8.30am, so when I called for an appointment and eventually got through 4 minutes later,how can all but 1 appointment be available with my doctor,who I know was in all day. I was given this appointment which is great and the surgery was on time when I went in for the appointment.I just want to understand how only 1 can be available 4 minutes into opening."
Needham,Use of E-consult,4/10/2019,4,"In a week I've used E-consult twice. First occasion was to talk with GP about my son. I had to chase this as 4days after submitting it I hadn't heard anything from the surgery. The system states you will get email/telephone call in 24hours. They did apologize and a GP telephone consultation was set up, which I got that day, and as always my GP was excellent.
The 2nd I submitted a query for myself early morning (8.30am ISH) and by 1pm the same day I had a call from the team telling me my GP wants me to get blood tests. When they couldn't offer an appointment for over 2 weeks they suggested trying the clinic on Landseer road but didn't give me any info on how to book that. So would just say that would be more helpful if possible.
I cannot recommend using E-consult enough. When you work it is such a good tool."
Needham,Usually run late but care is good,7/4/2018,4,I had an appointment in July. Have never had a problem with obtaining an appointment at this practice or obtaining a call back from a doctor. The same is true of my wife and also my son. The telephone system is much improved and avoids the need for making repeated attempts at getting through. It is normal to wait within the practice beyond the appointment time (today it was in excess of 40 minutes) but I don't mind that at all if it means a more thorough appointment. I have never felt rushed out of the door and feel the doctors have always taken adequate time to assess problems and offer advice or next steps. I believe that is to be commended in times where pressure upon our local surgeries is high. I am worried about the growth in housing within the town and wonder how the surgery will continue to operate but that is true of many places.
Needham,Usually see own GP,8/15/2018,4,"Usually get to see my own GP which is important to me, I know she works part time but I'm happy to wait for her. There aren't normally any appointments available if you use the automated system."
Needham,Very conscientious,8/24/2019,5,"have a lovely doctor. Often no appointments available on the day, but can prebook. Up to 45 minute wait is acceptable time to wait. GP often makes calls between appointments - very conscientious."
Needham,Very difficult to get an appointment,1/23/2017,3,My overall experience at this surgery hasn't been positive. I only seem to secure an appointment if I queue up at 8am in the morning waiting for the surgery to open at 8.30am. I've tried to book an appointment for a smear test twice and each time no appointments were available so I'm told to wait and phone back next month. This is very upsetting for someone who has a history of abnormal cells.  I never see the same Dr twice in over 12 months as my registered GP has been on long term absence and they've never assigned me someone else. I have never seen the GP at my allotted time as they are always running behind.
Needham,Very difficult to get appointments,1/8/2018,2,"Its very difficult to get appointments, the system doesn't work. They have not seen me but send out medication with limited explanations so I'm often unsure what and when I should be taking. There doesn't seem to be any planning for the extra houses going up either."
Needham,Very friendly.,8/24/2019,4,They will always fit us in to see the doctor if it's an emergency. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Usually wait 15 minutes.
Needham,Very good,8/24/2019,4,"Never had any issues, they are always very good. The staff are helpful. I would usually expect to wait about 20 mins and that is acceptable. I found ringing for an appointment today quicker than usual. I feel the surgery is attentive and let me know results quickly if needed."
Needham,Very good nurse,8/15/2018,3,"The nurse I see is very good, she's so approachable and friendly but appointments do run behind and  you have to wait to be seen. Sometimes the doctor can be running up to an hour behind but you do get good care though."
Needham,Very good nurses,7/8/2018,5,"Can get appointments when I need them and I have a great GP. The nurses have been very good and I don't mind waiting my turn to be seen, all very good."
Needham,Very good surgery,1/28/2019,5,"It's a very good surgery, you can wait to be seen a little past your appointment time but you don't feel rushed at all. Doctors have been good and the care has been great. The surgery ha started asking why the appointment is needed which I find a bit odd but generally very happy with the surgery."
Needham,very poor experience,3/2/2020,1,"I was told my letter, which I need for my employer, would take ""a few days"".  When I chased it after 10 days, I was promised it the the next day.  18 days later and I am still waiting."
Needham,Very supportive,8/8/2018,5,"Always friendly, getting through on the phone is the only issue. Doctors are very supportive even though I have an asigned doctor I don't often see them. Appointments for the children are good to get, if the time it takes for you to be able to speak to reception could be improved it would be great. It can be quite intrusive when reception staff ask you questions and if you want to keep something private you are pressed for more information."
Needham,Very supportive doctor,12/16/2015,5,"My doctor saw that I had arrived early due to the bus timetable so fitted me in early which I did not expect. My Dr has been great, very supportive, where possible arranges for my appointments to be at the outreach surgery in the local pharmacy so I don't have to travel."
Needham,Very thorough doctor,7/8/2018,4,"The doctor I see is very thorough, I've never had a similar kind response that I got from her around my condition. Shes very supportive and because shes so good it can be a bit of a wait to see her, which is understandable. Booking appointments in the morning is difficult with work but having the queue system on the phone is an improvement to having to keep ringing back."
Needham,Waiting times can be a bit long at times,4/21/2016,5,On some occasions waiting times can be a bit long but the care I receive from doctors is great.
Needham,Waits for blood tests,8/15/2018,4,Can get blood tests done at the surgery however at times its quicker to go to the Riverside clinic.
Needham,What a service,6/17/2023,5,"I know for a lot of us econsult doesn't always work but … completed one at 8 am for my father,  phone call offering him an appointment by 9 ! Couldn’t do that day, I was offered one the next day. 
On arrival, reception staff extremely helpful. Locum (I believe) doctor very thorough, multiple tests and referrals arranged. Back to the reception, get ICE forms printed, 3 ladies were helping us out. Called on Friday for test results, took few minutes to wait on the phone. I was given the results  and the receptionist even remembered us from Wednesday. 
Working in GP surgery myself , this was an amazing experience, and we are both very grateful for all your help ! Keep up the good work !"
Needham,Will do anything to help,8/8/2018,5,"Friendly surgery and the doctors are very good. Very caring and understanding and will do all they can to get things sorted. Its all good, nothing really to change other than there being a bit of a queue on the phone but its not too bad.getting through"
Needham,Wish the car park was bigger,1/24/2020,4,I can usually get an appointment in good time. I do wish the car park was bigger as it is a good surgery overall.
Needham,Works well,1/28/2019,4,"Just getting the appointment is the only issue, it can take some time but you always get to see your own doctor. The whole surgery works well its just more difficult if you are trying to get an appointment when you are working."
Needham,Works well,8/15/2018,5,There's not really a problem at all with the surgery it all works well. Pretty much you can get appointments when you need them which is good. I can see the new online triage system working well for advice but maybe if you need an appointment not so much.
Needham,Would like to be able to book ahead,7/8/2018,5,"Doctors are all good. I would like to be able to book appointments ahead so that you can plan more. On the whole it doesn't work badly and the queue on the phone went down quickly this morning. I'd prefer not to have receptionists asks me why I need an appointment, they are not medically trained to decide who I should see."
Needham,You don't always need to take an appointment,2/8/2018,4,"I have always found it possible to obtain an appointment when I have needed one. It is usually also possible to obtain a call back from the doctor should you be uncertain about whether an appointment is necessary. So far, I have been happy with the service provided at this surgery and I hope it continues this way despite the challenges evident within ""the system"". I understand why people may find it difficult to offer a view on their reason for calling to receptionists but this is a growing necessity in order to make sure that people are seeking help from the right places. I have found the reception staff to be professional and polite at this practice."
Oakfield,.......... Still lost with nevie,8/3/2020,2,.......... having a bad experience with this new system.
Oakfield,7 day wait for an emergency appointment,3/21/2017,4,I called for an emergency appointment and I was told there would be a seven day wait. I wasn't happy and eventually was allowed to remain and wait today.
Oakfield,A committed and friendly team,6/16/2020,5,"I've been with Oakfield surgery for over 10 years and have become a 'regular' in the last 6 years. I think the staff are lovely, there is a genuine sense of care even if you do turn up a 5.55pm on a Friday to collect medication. They are great with the children and I no complaints about our medical care or access to appointments."
Oakfield,A good surgery,3/21/2017,4,I am quite happy-this is a good surgery
Oakfield,A good surgery which has served us well.,3/13/2020,5,"We have been with Oakfield for almost 3 years, and it has consistently served our family well.

We have seen and been treated by a number of the staff, and found them all capable and attentive, and our records are well maintained and shared effectively (we mention this has not always been the case in some of our previous surgeries).

We would also like to address some of the criticisms levelled at the reception staff: in our experience, these appear unfounded. The staff is certainly no-nonsense, but as all primary care centres , this is a busy practice and as such, its staff must deal with patients swiftly. The lone instance of a receptionist being curt with a patient was a result of the patient's impatient and aggressive demeanour, and even then, the receptionist remained professional despite visible (and understandable) strained frustration.

Oakfield is a good practice, and we recommend it unreservedly."
Oakfield,a great job,6/8/2016,5,This surgery does a great job considering the amount of people they have to process
Oakfield,Absolutely Disgusted,8/9/2021,1,"I rang to ask for some advice after test results and I was spoken to like I was just an annoying inconvenience. Having suffered with depression for many years being treated like this and basically being told to get on with it has really upset me. It has showed that an individuals medical condition  is not something they take into account. What I find ironic are the signs that ask us to give the staff respect and curtesy, what a shame it doesn’t work both ways."
Oakfield,Access difficult,6/11/2015,3,Difficult to make an appointment or get through to surgery by phone. You an only get an emergency appointment on the day but it might not be an emergency
Oakfield,All fine,11/21/2022,5,The surgery is all fine and staff are great. It's a wonderful surgery and I've been invited in for my annual review which is really good and have found it easy to get appointments when I've needed them.
Oakfield,all staff amazing,5/9/2019,5,From the moment I joined Oakfields I was amazed by the friendliness and helpfulness when you need it most ...... from discussing what care you need with Receptionists to getting the appointment and attention to detail of that care with the Doctor.  I am so very pleased (and relieved) to say how the staff at this practice just go that extra mile to help.
Oakfield,All staff are engaging and friendly,6/12/2019,5,I have always found the staff warm and helpful from front desk to GP
Oakfield,Altogether good surgery,3/4/2020,4,It is easy to get an appointment here it is an altogether good surgery.
Oakfield,Always been good here,3/21/2017,5,I have been a patient for two years and it has always been good.I can always get an appointment. They review my daughter (9 months) regularly.
Oakfield,Always been great to me and saved my life,10/3/2020,5,I find all the staff really helpful and friendly especially reception.
Oakfield,Always excellent,4/14/2020,5,Always superb
Oakfield,Always great service,3/23/2021,5,I have used this surgery for a number of years and I have had had any reason to complain. Its hard to find a good practice but I would recommend this surgery to anyone.
Oakfield,Always had good service at oakfield,12/4/2021,5,Good doctors with just the right amount of empathy. Get on with their job without fuss or flannel.
Oakfield,Ask my GP is easy to use,3/17/2023,4,The system is easy to use but I don't feel that I always get to see someone when I maybe need to.  The doctors and nurses are good and they explain everything very well. I have a lot of health issues but not seeing the same GP does sometimes make it difficult as they don't know my full history.
Oakfield,Ask My GP very good,10/11/2022,3,I do use and find Ask My GP very good but I do feel that there is no holistic approach to general health and since covid I feel slightly let down as underlying causes of my ill health.
Oakfield,Awful and very rude service every time,6/12/2019,1,Awful and very rude service every time and the surgery even suggested that I get the prescriptions from a chemist instead of them.
Oakfield,Been with this surgery for 18 years,8/10/2019,5,"Friendly, helpful and accommodating staff with extra mention for Dr (name removed).Could not ask for a better or more understanding GP"
Oakfield,Best I've been to,3/18/2017,5,this practice is the best that I have ever been to
Oakfield,Brilliant,3/17/2023,5,"I really like using Ask My GP as I've had quick responses on the same day.  The doctors are very good they listen and very compassionate.  They have provided great end of life care for a family member, we were well supported and cared for as a family.  I don't feel that there is a need to see a doctor all the time so the system works really well as it prevents coming to the surgery for medication changes or simple things.  I've never had a time when I haven't been able to get a face to face appointment when it's been needed.  The system allows you to ask to see someone specific or see anyone which is a good option."
Oakfield,Brilliant,11/11/2022,5,"Seen today after doing an Ask My GP and speaking to the doctor. I have been in to see the doctor even before my actual appointment time. Reception were very accommodating and I was happy with the GP I saw, it seems to be a good system. The dispensary has also been very good, efficient and helpful."
Oakfield,Brilliant,10/11/2022,5,"Helpful staff and I've had quick responses using the Ask My GP system. It's worked well to get an actual appointment with a doctor, and I'm impressed with how well it worked today."
Oakfield,Can be a bit of a wait on the phone,3/4/2020,3,"Getting through on the phone can be up to 10 mins, but on the whole its a good surgery and the doctors here are very good."
Oakfield,Can't praise highly enough,4/9/2017,5,My son has been quite poorly and I can't praise the practice highly enough. They certainly went the extra mile for us.
Oakfield,Caring,11/11/2022,5,"Good at the moment, staff have been good and caring. I call for appointments and don't feel any pressure to go online which is great and I'm happy with how it's all working. I've been in and out before my actual appointment time too."
Oakfield,Clinicians are good but receptionists are unfriendly. Surgery is unclean,7/9/2017,4,This is in comparison with my last practice which was outstanding! There are lots of flies-both dead and alive-on the waiting room ceiling plus there are cobwebs. Attitude of reception staff is unfriendly but clinicians are good!
Oakfield,Difficult to see a GP,11/21/2022,4,I do feel I'm listened to but not able to see my own GP which is annoying. I do feel that age is a factor in whether you're seen or not and Ask My GP is only available online so you have to have IT to access it.
Oakfield,Don't seem to care about you,2/16/2021,2,"Never treat you as someone in a needy state, need care and concern and not an officious attitude, more helpful and friendly attitude."
Oakfield,Dr's are fine and nurses are good but long waiting times,7/9/2017,4,Delays after appointment times are bad. It would be helpful if people could be made aware of how times are running when they book in. Getting an appointment is good though and the Dr's. are fine and Nurses are good.
Oakfield,Efficient and friendly,7/1/2021,5,Great - I am very happy with Oakfield Surgery
Oakfield,Efficient and friendly in difficult times,1/14/2021,5,Despite the huge pressure the surgery is under the clinical staff always have time to help and are very friendly
Oakfield,Everything is good here,3/4/2020,5,"Everything is good here, easy to get appointment, no long waits, no issues. I am also happy about the move of the surgery to Newmarket Hospital it will be closer to my home."
Oakfield,Excellent,3/18/2017,5,I have been a patient for 20 years and I have always found them to be excellent
Oakfield,Excellent,6/11/2015,5,I feel very safe and well cared for at this practice. Very pleased with the service
Oakfield,Excellent service,2/10/2021,5,The new system of email or video appointments as an option to face to face appointments is really effective. We hear back extremely promptly (sometimes within a few minutes) and have received very efficient and effective service from our GP and nurse practitioners. I thoroughly recommend this practice which is forward-looking and up to date.
Oakfield,excellent service -,6/9/2019,5,"We joined the surgery a few months ago after a recommendation from a local friend and from the very first visit we have been extremely impressed by all staff and the services received. I was expecting very different service based on past experience at a surgery we were patients of for over 20 years, this one, is outstanding and I would definitely recommend it to others."
Oakfield,Excellent service and support from oakfield.,9/30/2020,5,"During the pandemic Oakfield Surgery  have managed to move to a new location with minimal disruption to patients and we were kept fully informed and updated during the process. They have also implemented the new ‘my gp’ system which is efficient and easy to use. On the few occasions I have needed advice from my GP I have received a call back from her within the hour. I am very grateful to have such excellent health care professionals at my surgery.
Well done and thank you to everyone at Oakfield Surgery for keeping the service going and keeping the patients safe at this difficult time."
Oakfield,Explanations were lacking,10/11/2022,3,"I recently was told to get blood tests done by a doctor but that was all they said so I came to have it done but on arrival I found out that appointments now have to be made and you can't just turn up. It would've been helpful if this had been explained by the doctor.  When using Ask My GP the responses are received in a good time and that side of things is fine, its just that information is sometimes lacking."
Oakfield,Fantastic practice and service,3/21/2017,5,"This practice is fantastic!! They provide a very good, personal service."
Oakfield,First class surgery and staff,12/3/2020,5,I have been with Oakfield for over 20 years and all ways felt the staff were extremely helpful and listen to my concerns.  I think reception staff are doing a great job considering they are often under a lot of pressure with taking calls as well as dealing with patients at the desk.  Keep up the great work.
Oakfield,Good reception staff,11/21/2022,5,"I use Ask My GP which works well, and I find the reception staff good and the telephone responses with GPs have covered all bases. I also use hearing services here with no problems at all and I really like the parking."
Oakfield,GP is really great but getting appointments can be hard,3/21/2017,4,I have to say it is an emergency to get an appointment but when I get one our GP is great.
Oakfield,Great,6/11/2015,5,consistently good medical treatment. Thank you for this service
Oakfield,Great practice,4/9/2017,5,This is a great practice-they look after me very well. I would not want to have to move to any other GP
Oakfield,Great service since Ask your GP,3/30/2020,4,I have had to use Ask your GP service quite a lot recently fir myself my daughters and my mum. I think it is a great service have always been contacted by someone the same day and everything I’ve asked for has happened. Far better than sitting in a telephone queue waiting to speak to a receptionist.
Oakfield,Great system,3/17/2023,5,I really like the Ask My GP system its quicker and more efficient. You get to see the right person for the issue and it prevents unnecessary visits. The staff are as good as gold and they've sorted out the daily injections I've needed.
Oakfield,Great!,4/9/2017,5,There is sometimes a delay after the appointment time but that is the only thing. Otherwise-great!
Oakfield,Happy with family care,11/21/2022,4,Generally happy with the family care and use Ask My GP which worked really well. It's a good service and I was phoned back within a reasonable time and was listened to by the doctor.
Oakfield,Hard getting appointments,3/21/2017,3,It is difficult getting an appointment. I was on hold for 20 minutes when I called in.
Oakfield,Helpful and efficient,1/27/2021,5,"I've always found the staff at the surgery to be helpful and efficient, despite the phone ringing off the hook in normal times. I have to say the AskMyGP system is brilliant and cannot recommend it enough I ask questions about my health, prescriptions etc and the response is almost immediate."
Oakfield,Helpful and experienced staff,10/3/2020,5,"Helpful and polite reception staff, caring GP. Been with them over 10 years and always happy with the service."
Oakfield,Helpful staff,3/17/2023,4,I've got used to the Ask my GP system and I have had good responses from it.  I like that you can ask questions if there are any follow up issues. It allows you to ask for what  you need and there is flexibility in the system. Staff are helpful and pleasant and the surgery is a good experience all round.  Getting medication is not a smooth process any more and there appear to be barriers but when there are problems it would be better to get better information.
Oakfield,Home visits are hard to get,3/21/2017,1,I have asked for help while my husband is in hospital having one of his kidneys removed (we are both 90). I don't know if I will get help. Home visits from the practice are quite hard for us to get.
Oakfield,I have been very well served by this practice but long waiting times for appts,7/9/2017,4,"Getting an appointment can be a problem and past experience leads me to expect a 30 min. delay in being called in. This said, I have been very well served medically by the practice"
Oakfield,If only all GPs were this good,7/24/2019,5,"Having gone to see Dr about recurring headaches ,received a call from her that Addenbrokes would see me. Scan done the same day .I've met about a dozen people at three different sites and they were all a credit to the NHS, but none of it would have happened without A GP pushing to get it sorted.Thank you."
Oakfield,It can be tricky calling at 8.00 for an appointment,3/21/2017,3,To get and appointment you have to call at 8.00. This can be tricky as I have to take my children to school at that time. Today I had to get my father to make the call on my behalf. I got an 'on the day' (not emergency) appointment but routine take 14 days. I prefer to see specific clinicians as I find some are more knowledgeable than others.
Oakfield,Left due to poor care,1/18/2023,2,I decided to leave the surgery when I felt I wasn't being listened to and my concerns were being ignored. I struggled to get face to face appointments when I needed them so I felt I needed to move to a different surgery.
Oakfield,Less personal,3/17/2023,4,"It's a less personal service now with Ask My GP and its not really to my liking, however, the children are seen very quickly and I do get quick responses but it is difficult to see someone face to face.  It can depend who you speak to as some listen well where as other don't.  I am concerned about how easy young people will feel when they have to go through the system and wait for a call back."
Oakfield,Like Ask My GP,3/17/2023,5,I like Ask My GP as it works well and in 2 hours I normally get a response with the most appropriate member of staff.  The majority of the time I get to see a a doctor and I'm confident in the care provided.  I find it is better than phoning as its quicker and allows you to ask for someone specific if you would prefer that.  The staff are great and I'm very happy with them all.
Oakfield,Made me feel like a burden and long delays with appointments,3/21/2017,2,I have been waiting more than 30 minutes today. It would be good if there was some way in which patients could be told if there is some kind of hold up. Last time I visited to discuss contraception and their attitude made me feel as if I was a burden-that I shouldn't be there. There is a wait of two weeks for a routine appointment.
Oakfield,"No concerns, very good",3/4/2020,5,"I have no concerns here, they are very good, its a bonus that the move of the surgery is closer to my home."
Oakfield,Not a good experience,11/28/2021,2,I had a very painful foot that meant at times I couldn’t even walk. Finally after 5 days I called the GP surgery. Instead of taking the time to see me they wanted a blood test. Two days later I received a blood test.  However that very day the pain was so bad I called 111. They suggested I go to A&E. After a 4-5 hour wait I was diagnosed with an infected foot. Something a GP could have diagnosed very quickly had they taken the time to see me. Weeks later I haven’t heard from the Surgery about the blood tests nor have they contacted me about my A&E visit that I assume they’ve been informed of. In most areas the NHS has fallen apart with only A&E a reliable source of medical care. I assume their reasoning is available time. No wonder when doctors at this surgery seem to be on a part time rota.
Oakfield,Not as personal,6/12/2023,4,"I've had issues trying to use Ask My GP and getting technical issues sorted but now thats done the system is okay to use.  I do feel it is a more de-personalised system now with the online submission followed by phone calls for many appointments or issues. Contact is not the same anymore and issues are often dealt with via messages too, however, when I've really needed to be seen I have been.  I recognise that people may over use the service but I have been concerned with the way in which reception staff spoke to a elderly patient when they had walk to the surgery to get an appointment in the freezing cold weather. The person was unable to use Ask My GP but was spoken to in an uncaring way. In the end they were told they could either wait at the surgery for an undetermined length of time to be seen or go home and wait for a call back.  It could all have been done in a nicer way."
Oakfield,Not great,6/29/2021,3,"Doctors only work sporadically. A first in my experience at a surgery. This causes problems in keeping on top of a patients medical issues. Add the fact that speaking with someone at the surgery is only made available for short hours in a day and, wrong or right,  it feels like a surgery who work for themselves not the patients."
Oakfield,Not happy with new Doctor,11/13/2020,3,Things aren’t as good as they used to be. You feel confident with your Doctor and they change the Clinician.
Oakfield,Not respected,9/30/2020,2,"Reception staff very rude and unhelpful 
Ask my GP app is bad as the doctors give the wrong information. Only nice lady there was, was from the dispensary!"
Oakfield,Not respected,9/30/2020,2,"Reception staff very rude and unhelpful 
Ask my GP app is bad as the doctors give the wrong information. Only nice lady there was, was from the dispensary!"
Oakfield,Nurses are better than Doctors for keeping appointments,7/9/2017,4,Delays after appointment times are pretty well the norm. This said Nurses are better than doctors (on appoinment times).
Oakfield,Occasional wait,4/9/2017,4,I occasionally have to wait longer than my appointment time. I struggle to book non-emergency appointments.
Oakfield,Outstanding Care and excellent staff,3/18/2017,5,"Much, much better than my previous practice.My GP is impeccable, excellent. Reception staff are exceptional and I receive outstanding care"
Oakfield,'Phone can take a while to be answered and staff can be rude,7/9/2017,4,Calling in to reception is not a good experience. It can take a while to be answered and they can be a bit rude sometimes. Also it is usual to wait 30 mins after the appointment time.
Oakfield,Phone consultation,9/14/2022,3,Tried contacting the surgery this morning to see a GP but they advised to go to A&E as my husband has recently had a stroke and they felt it was better for us to go straight to hospital.
Oakfield,Poor,9/30/2019,1,"I guess the reception staff have signed the Hippocratic oath as you are expected to tell them what’s wrong and they decide who you see, I guess they’re qualified as well.
You used to be treated really well here, but under the new management it’s terrible!,"
Oakfield,Poor service for a second time,6/15/2021,1,We are new to the practice. The ‘ask my gp’ service seems to be more a ‘we are utterly avoiding face to face appointment no matter how urgent your problem is’ service. First phone appointment by gp was absolutely useless and the doctor was wrong and the practice does not have a record of it. Second phone appointment today was with nurse practitioner who thinks my son’s hay fever is only a viral infection only in the most general sense of it!
Oakfield,Possibly the best GP practice in the Uk.,5/27/2021,5,"The doctors are totally approachable, show caring for us and listen and help us every time. They are accessible and we always get to see a  doctor or nurse. The reception team, nurses and staff are helpful, polite and kind without exception . The paramedics also offer great support. I have used this practice for over 25 years. Whether its physical, medical  or mental/:emotional problems. This team are absolutely first class in every way possible. We are so grateful to them."
Oakfield,Pretty good allround.,4/9/2017,4,This practice is pretty good all round but it would be good if there were more appointments after 5.00-6.00 for shift workers.
Oakfield,Pretty oustanding,3/21/2017,5,This practice is pretty outstanding all round and I  really have no complaints
Oakfield,Quick responses,3/17/2023,4,Ask My GP gets quick responses and its been a very good service with very good staff.
Oakfield,Really good,3/17/2023,5,"A really good surgery, really efficient and medication requests are dealt with easily.  It's flexible to get appointments around work and I find the message (Ask My GP) system quicker.  It would be even better if I could access my notes on the system too like I can with My Chart from Addenbrookes. I receive great care and I'm really pleased with how it all works."
Oakfield,Really good experience,7/5/2022,5,"I just wanted to shout something positive about this community health service for once. Throughout covid and post covid I have had nothing but a good experience with Oakfields. The online chat is really quick and efficient and better than pre-covid. In my experience we haven’t been let down once, with child rashes, blocked ears, sprained ankles, suspicious lumps and viruses, we’ve either seen/FaceTimed or spoken to a healthcare professional very quickly and still with care and attention. I haven’t felt like I couldn’t reach out to my GP. Their system works very well for us. I know they’ll never be able to support everyone all the time but I feel very lucky so far."
Oakfield,Really swift care even during pandemic,2/11/2020,5,"Using the MyGP app, I got through to a Doctor swiftly, with prescription and bloods ordered. I feel my child is being very well cared for, despite the current pandemic and difficult circumstances they are navigating."
Oakfield,Reception staff can be extremely rude,1/23/2020,3,Overall it’s good. But the manner and attitude of reception is shocking. I have witnessed their poor manner with other patients too. This makes it a bad experience overall. Most the GPs are v good and the nurses are knowledgeable and efficient
Oakfield,Reception staff very unhelpful,3/11/2020,3,"The reception staff need lessons in how to deal with someone upset and in pain, both face to face and on the telephone."
Oakfield,Reception very helpful,10/11/2022,1,"Reception are very helpful and friendly but I really don't like using Ask My GP and would like to be able to just phone up and book an appointment with a GP, hence the rating I've given."
Oakfield,Receptionist always so rude!,7/6/2021,1,There is one young receptionist that is very pleasant but every time I call the receptionist I speak to is always so rude. I was very polite and after every call it puts me in a bad mood from being spoken to like dirt. I had a very simple request of booking my depot injection and I am so flexible also. Training on telephone manner is definitely needed as I’ve complained about this matter before and clearly no improvement. It’s nice to be nice and a doctors surgery should be a prime example and not be making patients feel anxious about calling and making appointments!
Oakfield,Receptionists always helpful,12/3/2020,5,I have always had a good experience when visiting the surgery
Oakfield,Responses don't fully address issues,11/21/2022,4,I find Ask My GP is a little bit restrictive when trying to get an appointment and would prefer to just get a face to face appointment without going through it all. The responses on the system don't always fully address the issues so the process is more drawn out and needs more contacts with the surgery. I have found appointments for blood tests easy to get.
Oakfield,Running late but never tell you,12/24/2020,1,Got to my appointment before the time I was meant to be there and they were still 25 minutes late! They never tell you how long it’s going to be or how many people the doctor has got before you. Would be nice to know because I was made late for work
Oakfield,Seems like system is under pressure,10/11/2022,4,"When you do see someone face-to-face it's good, but when you go back and forth online it feels like issues aren't being addressed quickly and using Ask My GP does seem to draw out the length and number of times you have to contact the surgery, when an actual chat or appointment would address things quicker. It just feels like the system is under a lot of pressure."
Oakfield,Should be unacceptable,6/19/2019,1,"Poor call handling in the morning to obtain an appointment, very difficult to get an appointment at all. Reception staff unhelpful. 
Only seen by nurse practitioner, not seen by doctor. I’ve had to go private to receive any care at all."
Oakfield,Simple process,11/21/2022,5,"I found Ask My GP was good to use today as it has enabled me to get an appointment with a doctor, it's a nice simple process which I really like."
Oakfield,sometime there is a wait,4/9/2017,4,There is sometimes a wait in excess of 30 mins. after my appointment time. Also I am not sure of the appointment system. I feel uncomfortable in classing my myself as an emergency so usually go for 'routine' which takes time
Oakfield,staff are understanding and welcoming,7/26/2019,5,"Whenever I need help the staff are always so accommodating and understanding, they do their very best to help and take into consideration my other family members"
Oakfield,Staff changes,8/16/2020,2,"I have been switched doctors twice in the last 2 years, to recently find out 2 of the other clinicians I usually see has left. There is no continuity of care and it doesn't make me confident that so many doctors and nurses have left the surgery."
Oakfield,Staff very friendly,3/4/2020,4,I am concerned that there is no dedicated parking area for GP patients when it moves to the Newmarket hospital as a location. The staff are always friendly and sociable and helpful on the phone. I usually ring at 8 am and I can usually get an appointment on the day. There is a voluntary bus for transport around the town but you do have to book in advance so I'm not sure if that will be helpful to patients or not. Communication needs to be better when doctors are running late for their appointments. Some of the doctors do not always make things as clear as I would like and I have felt a bit rushed at times.
Oakfield,Terrible incompetent staff.,6/21/2019,1,Appointment apparently not booked properly by reception and vaccine was out of stock so after a half hour drive and a half hour drive back with 1 year old daughter no vaccine given. Very unfriendly rude reception staff on every visit!
Oakfield,The nurse is an excllent role model!!,7/9/2017,5,I have seen the nurse a couple of times on previous visits. She has always been very kind and professional. I am a student nurse and she has been an excellent role model for me
Oakfield,The staff care about you.,7/20/2021,5,"Oakfield doctors will ALWAYS see you if you are really poorly. They respond effectively and politely via AskMyGP, and will see you face-to-face if you need it. This surgery far surpasses others that I work with professionally."
Oakfield,Two galling aspects of policy.,1/14/2020,5,"I feel the policy of reception staff asking what I want to see a doctor about to be frustrating, disrespectful & insulting. Dr seems to have no apparent concern that the appointment time is always late --- 55 minutes is the longest delay( so far !) I do however, believe that my two gripes are a very small price to pay for me having the absolute privilege of benefitting from the best GP practice I've ever known!! Further, the practice manager is brilliant."
Oakfield,Very friend team.,5/26/2020,5,Nothing is too much trouble.Go the extra mile for you.
Oakfield,Very friendly staff. Know your name,2/9/2021,5,I have been with the surgery and would give them 10/10. Friendly. Helpful . What more can I say. Would highly recommend
Oakfield,Very good,6/12/2023,5,"Now have Ask My GP and it's working really well to get help or appointments, which ever is needed. The only thing I'd like to see change is feedback after tests so you know for sure there is nothing wrong, rather than worrying they've just forgotten you."
Oakfield,Very good staff,11/21/2022,5,Staff are very good it's just the process of contacting the surgery that is the problem and that I don't particularly like the Ask My GP system. I would much prefer to be able to just call up and make an appointment. I order my medication online and find this a much simpler and easier process.
Oakfield,Very good surgery,5/22/2023,5,"I've been very pleased with how Ask My GP works to get appointments, whenever they are needed I've got help quickly. I've seen the nurse twice recently and have been really happy with the treatment and care provided. I've had my regular check ups and have been sent text messages to book the appointments.  My asthma is well monitored by them as is my high blood pressure.  I am concerned for those who don't use online services as most access does seem via this route now."
Oakfield,Very happy overall,3/18/2017,5,"I am very happy overall with the practice, they are all very knowledgeable"
Oakfield,Very quick response,11/21/2022,5,"Had a very quick response after completing an Ask My GP and have then been given an appointment with a nurse who is the appropriate person to see.  I did find using Ask My GP a little confusing, but it has worked to get the appointment I need. Generally, the surgery and staff are very nice, and it works really well now being up at the hospital and it's great there is no charge for the parking, makes it a lot easier."
Oakfield,Very supportive doctors,11/21/2022,5,"I like Ask My GP as it avoids having to call the surgery and it gets a quick response. I did however ask for a chat with the GP and they continued on conversing via Ask My GP which was a little frustrating. The doctors are very supportive especially around the care and treatment for my trans child. The first appointment we had was such a positive experience and couldn't have asked for more. I've also had very positive menopause care and treatment and I like the surgery at the hospital now, it's a much better location."
Oakfield,"Very, very good practice",3/21/2017,5,"I have been a patient since 2005. It is a very, very good practice. I had a severe asthma attack (in the practice) the first of my life and they were superb."
Oakfield,Waiting times can be long,3/21/2017,5,I have had to wait quite a long time once or twice. To balance this however I was late arriving this morning and they are still seeing me which is good
Oakfield,well organised professional friendly team,9/22/2020,5,over the years l have never had anything short of a good experience with the practice
Oakfield,Works well,3/17/2023,5,"I have no complaints at all, I'm able to get appointments when needed and I'm happy to see any one so may be that helps. The whole system works well."
Orchard  ,1,1/16/2023,5,Its a very good surgery where appointments are easy to get and the staff are great at explaining issues or how to access the care you need. I'm here for a nurse appointment and it was easy to book this in advance for a convenient time.
Orchard  ,A Good Surgery,1/18/2023,5,It's always been a good surgery and I'm happy with the process in place to get appointments as I've not had any issues. I do like to try and see the same GP if at all possible but if it's not I'm happy to see someone else. Staff have always treated me more than kindly over the years and I can't suggest anything that needs to change.
Orchard  ,A very good surgery,12/21/2021,5,"Overall it's a very good surgery, I've not noticed any delays being seen either. I prefer talking to the doctor as it means issues can be sorted with out coming in to the surgery which works well. Lovely staff who explain things really well and you're even given a choice of male or female doctors too. A few years ago I did find that the mental health understanding and support wasn't as good as I'd hoped for."
Orchard  ,A1 but sometimes a staff member can be sharp.,4/18/2017,5,All A1 but sometimes one of the reception staff can be a bit sharp.  Generally they are good though
Orchard  ,Access is good,8/25/2019,4,Appointment access is good and waiting tome at appointment is swift. I have a small child and they always put us through quickly. Access to the toilet is impossible with a wheelchair.
Orchard  ,All good,1/16/2023,5,Called and have had no issues getting appointments although the phones can be busy at times. A couple of times it has said all the phone lines are busy and to call back but when I have I've got through. The doctors and nurses are great and I've been helped by reception when I needed to use the BP machine and was unsure what to do. I've also been able to book blood test appointments at the surgery rather than having to go up to the hospital which is easier.
Orchard  ,All have a good attitude,1/23/2019,4,"All here have a good attitude with the exception of some of the dispensary staff. While in the waiting room today I have seen a confused older man sent backwards and forwards between the surgery and Superdrug which seemed to be because the person dealing with him couldn’t/wouldn’t take the time to listen and sort him out! All of the more established doctors seem to be leaving as I now don’t see the same doctor twice. The triage/call system is very immediate but at the cost of continuity of care under the same clinician. That said, from what I hear this is still the best surgery in Newmarket."
Orchard  ,All very good.,9/8/2018,5,"I can get through on the phone', I am seen on the day if necessary. I am always able to get parked in the car park across the road so practically it all works. I have never had any reason to think my clinical consultations were anything other than exemplary. All in all its very good."
Orchard  ,Alway helpful and prompt on appointments,7/8/2019,5,"I wanted to thank the lady on reception, she helped me with some documents and was
extremely helpful and professional. Outstanding member of your staff."
Orchard  ,Always been good but now even better,1/23/2019,5,I’ve been a patient here for nearly 30 years and it has always been good but over the last few years it has got even better! They have always been brilliant with me and my family. Can’t fault anything and I’m very pleased to be a patient here.
Orchard  ,Always received  excellent service,4/16/2019,5,As patients over 12 years we have always had really good treatment and care. Could not fault it. I don't know how they do it but they always have a positive attitude towards all aspect of medical care.
Orchard  ,Amazing,8/25/2019,5,I feel the doctors are amazing. They give the time to listen. I like the callback system with the GP.
Orchard  ,Another doctor every visit,9/29/2016,2,On every visit you'll get another doctor to talk to.  That is not a good care and service.  Asking for something is a no go for them.
Orchard  ,Appointment system doesn't work well,6/28/2018,4,My children (grown up) work and the appointment system doesn't work well for them. They can't take the calls back.
Orchard  ,Appointment system isn't quite right,6/28/2018,4,"My only gripe is that I can't make an appointment ahead of time. I can't see the point of being told by a doctor to come back in a week, then not being able to book for a week in advance, thus having to ring in seven days and then having a call back to tell me I need an appointment !"
Orchard  ,Appointments available,9/27/2022,3,I've been able to get appointments when I've needed them and I've had no issues getting injections done by the nurses.  I do find that at times you're just sent away and told to take paracetamol rather than them getting to the bottom of the issue.
Orchard  ,Appointments easy to get,12/24/2019,5,"Appointments are easy to get. The doctor always calls back before an appointment is given, this system seems to work very well. You can also book appointments ahead if needed. This is a very good surgery."
Orchard  ,Appointments ok to get,5/31/2022,4,"I find it ok to get appointments, can't always see a doctor but can always see a nurse and they will get the doctor involved if they need to so it works ok."
Orchard  ,Been great,12/21/2021,5,The surgery has been great and I can get appointments when I need them and have only had to wait a few days for a recent blood test. The staff are great too.
Orchard  ,Best Surgery in UK during our life time,9/12/2018,5,Everyone is professional/helpful/considerate and should be recognised by the NHS to show how our surgeries should be run
Orchard  ,Brilliant,12/21/2021,5,100% the surgery has been excellent. The surgery have put referrals in for me but the hospital have bounced me back as they are unable to do the MRI for some reason but very happy with how the surgery have supported me.
Orchard  ,Brilliant,8/25/2019,5,"I think my surgery is brilliant, I phoned at 8.30 and spoke with a GP when he called back, and I'm in this morning at 10.30. I am treated with respect and like an adult."
Orchard  ,Brilliant Practice.,10/12/2018,5,The doctor's phone back service is so good and if I needed an appointment I have always been given one the same day.
Orchard  ,Call backs don't work for me,9/27/2022,1,"Having phone calls back with a doctor really don't work for me with my mental health issues. I've missed multiple calls and need an actual appointment, which I have today.  The calls just make me more anxious and make the situation worse."
Orchard  ,Can be tricky with young children,8/25/2019,4,"Find the callback system a bit awkward as I can't keep my phone on at school as a teacher. So I have to make an appointment on my day off. Don't get into the surgery at the appointment time, and when you have young children that can be tricky."
Orchard  ,Can't fault in any way,8/25/2019,5,"Can't fault it in any way. I like the appointment system, especially callback. Sometimes ave to wait a while in the waiting room, but I am patient."
Orchard  ,Can't fault the surgery,6/7/2022,5,The whole process works well for me. I've had a review today and I'm happy with the information provided. The staff are good and do what they can to make things easier.
Orchard  ,Can't fault them,12/21/2021,5,"The surgery is very good, I can't fault them. The changes that have been introduced due to covid haven't impacted in a negative way at all. I've been triaged, spoken to a doctor quickly and got the situation sorted, which is exactly what was needed. Staff have been very good too and you can have a laugh with them."
Orchard  ,Care wonderful,1/18/2023,4,The text reminders have been great and really helpful. It would be good to have a visual notification of the next patient being called like other organisations have as with my hearing loss and the accoustics in the room I find it very difficult to hear who is being called. The surgery though is good and provides wonderful care.
Orchard  ,Changed my repeat prescription...,10/23/2016,1,Without telling me. As a type 1 diabetic I rely on my prescriptions. On 3 occasions they have altered it without telling me. This final time it was a sunday and i had to call 111 for emergency supplies. This is after they promised never to do it again and apologising. Useless.
Orchard  ,Difficult,5/31/2022,3,"I've had real difficulties getting a face to face appointment as I've spoken to a doctor and they don't feel I need to be seen, which I would prefer."
Orchard  ,Difficult to get through,12/21/2021,4,I've found it difficult to get through on the phone in the mornings but apart from that its all good.
Orchard  ,Doctors and nurses very good,4/29/2022,5,The phones are very busy especially on a Monday morning so there can be long waits to talk to reception. I've had a mix of triage calls and face to face appointments and the doctors and nurses are all very good.
Orchard  ,Doctors are great,11/5/2018,5,The Doctors are all great (those that I have seen) and the 'being seen on the day' system more than makes up for any other minor niggles.
Orchard  ,Doctors are very good,1/23/2019,5,"I think that the doctors here are very good and appointments are no problem. English isn’t me first language but I can manage simple appointments without a translator, if it is something that I think I will need help with I bring my husband so there isn’t a need to get a translator in."
Orchard  ,Drs. are brilliant,11/5/2018,4,I like the 'on the day' appointment system and the doctors are brilliant. Today though I have been waiting 30 minutes to be seen and my two year old is becoming fractious and bored. She is starting to make a fuss (which isn't like her) and I am sensitive to the impact of this on others in the waiting room.
Orchard  ,Drs. are extremely helpful,7/30/2018,4,I can always get an appointment quickly. The doctors are always extremely helpful and check our health thoroughly.
Orchard  ,Econsult works well,12/21/2021,4,It's been a bit of a mixed experience. At one point when I was trying to get my child seen i didn't feel very supported as they just kept giving more medication rather than just seeing her which i didn't like. On other occasion it's been really good so I suppose it can depend on who you speak to. Not having continuity with a doctor doesn't help as they don't seem to appreciate the situation at times. Econsult has been a great addition and works really well as does the online prescription request.
Orchard  ,Everything else is absolutely fine,11/5/2018,5,"My experience is that I have to wait 20-30 minutes after my appointment time. This really niggles me. That said, everything else about the service is absolutely fine. Waiting room could do with a lick of paint"
Orchard  ,Everything has always been spot on,9/8/2018,5,"Everything has always been spot on for me here. Having said that I am 20 minutes late being called in and it is very, very warm in the waiting room. Cold water dispenser would be good.,"
Orchard  ,Excellent,1/16/2023,5,Nothing too bad getting through on the phone and appointments are avaialble when they are needed with the doctors or nurses and I don't feel that anything needs to improve or change. It's all very efficient and I'm happy to see any of the staff as they are all good.
Orchard  ,Excellent,7/10/2019,5,"This surgery and all the doctors and staff are so helpful, considerate and caring, I am very happy with the way the surgery is run, and all the help and support given me And my family over the years. Thank you"
Orchard  ,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Can be a slight delay but that is understandable and acceptablable as appointments sometimes need to be a little longer.  Fantastic all round
Orchard  ,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,I made an informed choice based on online and friends recommendation.  I am happy that this has worked out well.
Orchard  ,Excellent,4/18/2017,5,Patient for 6 years and I would certainly recommend
Orchard  ,Excellent,6/11/2015,5,"I cannot fault the organisation and clinical care. The system for arranging appointments, recently introduced, works extremely well and should be emulated by other practices. Staff are very friendly and helpful"
Orchard  ,Excellent appointments system,12/16/2019,5,"I phoned up this morning and the GP phoned me back within 30 seconds and gave me an appointment straight away. Ordering my repeat prescriptions on line is a bit tricky for me but that's not their fault I guess, I like the old style way."
Orchard  ,Excellent but attitude of receptionists disappointing.,4/18/2017,5,Only some of the receptionists are a little disappointing with their attitudes
Orchard  ,Excellent but hard to hear announcements and get appointments 'on the day',9/21/2017,5,Can't always hear tannoy announcements.  We are pleasantly amazed when we get an appointment on the day
Orchard  ,Excellent but surgery itself needs improvement,9/21/2017,5,Floor could do with renewing as there are damaged bits.  Loo has been iproved could be still better.  Handrails in loos would be helpful
Orchard  ,Excellent care and easy getting appointments,9/21/2017,5,I am treated so well by my doctor.  I can get an appointment on the day.  No concerns; everything is fine
Orchard  ,Excellent doctors,12/16/2019,5,"The doctors are excellent, good treatment and good hospital referrals if needed. Good communication on the front desk. This surgery is top, they get to know you over the years."
Orchard  ,"Excellent, staff very friendly",9/21/2017,5,I am very new to the area and this is my first visit.  Staff were very good and friendly when I phoned to register
Orchard  ,Excellent.,4/18/2017,5,You won't find any fault at Orchard House.  I have been a patient for years and they were brilliant when my husband was very ill.
Orchard  ,Excellent. Doctors and staff very friendly and polite,9/21/2017,5,Doctors and staff are courteous and friendly.  I phoned in and was called back within 10 minutes and got an appointment today
Orchard  ,"Excellent. Easy to get appointments, staff very pleasant",9/21/2017,5,"Appointments are easily available on the day if necessary.  All pleasant people with a mix of experience, some new, some well established.  Slight delay in going in is ok because patients get the time they need"
Orchard  ,Exemplary,6/11/2015,5,"Orchard House is exemplary-they have it just right. Appointment same day, good team of nurses. If they can be this good why can't the others?"
Orchard  ,Fantastic,5/31/2022,5,"I've always had very good treatment and care from staff, they've always been very helpful and are fantastic. During covid the vaccinations were all done at home for my wife which was easy and simple to organise, they were great."
Orchard  ,Fantastic little practice,6/28/2018,5,"Fantastic little practice. So much better than where I was before (Essex). It isn't perfect (could do with a lick of paint), but what is?"
Orchard  ,First class surgery,1/23/2019,4,I find all aspects of the service here to be excellent other than the call back system. I struggle to be able to be available for the call back (work reasons) but other than that it is a first class surgery.
Orchard  ,Free prescription delivery,12/24/2019,5,"It's a good surgery, you can book to see the doctor that you want to see. I really like the call back system. They do free delivery service for prescriptions."
Orchard  ,Friendly staff,1/16/2023,5,"I've had no issues getting appointments, most of mine are booked ahead of time by the nurse I see which works really well. The nurses are wonderful, efficient and so friendly.  I don't really feel there are any areas that need to change or improve."
Orchard  ,"Full marks, 5 out of 5 !",12/16/2019,5,"I am giving this surgery a full house, 5 out of 5, it really is a very good all round surgery. Doctors, nurses, front desk ladies are all brilliant."
Orchard  ,Generally good,2/13/2019,4,"Apart from an unfortunate delay for a prostate op. I have been VERY satisfied with my treatment. Being unable to use a telephone I find the appointment system difficult. I often still have problems with the on-line services despite 30 years computer experience,"
Orchard  ,Getting appointments is good,12/24/2019,5,"I would prefer the consistency of the same GP. Getting appointments is good no issue, this is a very good surgery."
Orchard  ,Good,8/25/2019,4,I don't come to the surgery often. So far my experience has been good.
Orchard  ,good,10/10/2016,4,"Good doctors, would recommend to a friend"
Orchard  ,good -,7/15/2016,4,Very happy with service
Orchard  ,Good but prescription lost.,4/18/2017,4,A consultant's letter indicating the need for a prescription slipped through the net.  I got an apology but missed  months medication.
Orchard  ,Good but sometimes a short delay in waiting room.,4/18/2017,4,This is a very good practice all round but there is sometimes a short delay in waiting room
Orchard  ,Good care of children,9/27/2022,5,We've been able to get appointments when needed at the surgery and the care of the children has been great. We don't come often but the call backs happen quickly and I feel that anxiety was supported well for a family member.  All admin letters arrive when they should too.
Orchard  ,Good experiences,12/21/2021,4,"Always had good experiences at the surgery. Econsult has worked well and is simple to use, I got a response back saying to have an appointment, so all good. Staff are always helpful too."
Orchard  ,Good service for children,12/16/2019,4,"When my children get ill they always get seen by the doctor on the same day. I don't like the call back aspect of this surgery from the GP, I feel it can be clumsy. It is not always possible to pick up the callback due to either poor reception or taking children in the car. I can feel a bit rushed in the surgery. I did notice recently that the doctors computer keyboard was a bit manky in the GP room, needs a good clean."
Orchard  ,Good Support,12/20/2021,4,"I find the staff very helpful and courteous, they provide good support and care and the information provided is really good too."
Orchard  ,GP's are excellent,12/16/2019,5,I normally get to see the same GP which is great. The GP's are excellent they give me time and they listen well. Dispensary lady can be a bit abrupt.
Orchard  ,Great regular appointments,9/27/2022,5,Excellent doctors and nurses and have regular appointments with the nurse who is great at explaining and why they are doing things. My husband is eligible for a shingles vaccine but he's not been invited in.
Orchard  ,Happy with the appointment system,6/28/2018,4,Usually a 5 to 10 minutes delay after appointment time - minor annoyance. Appointment system works ok for me.
Orchard  ,have always felt well cared for here,8/13/2018,5,a very professional but friendly and caring surgery.  always willing to help and provide services needed as soon as possible
Orchard  ,Have to be in for the ring back,12/4/2022,4,You have to ring up first thing and then be in for them to ring you back. The surgery is good but I would like to be seen and cover more than one thing at a time.
Orchard  ,Helpful staff,9/23/2021,5,It's a very good surgery where the doctors call you back when they say they will. The staff are very helpful and look after me well.  Its obviously a busy practice and I feel for them as they always seem rushed but the staff are great.
Orchard  ,High quality,8/25/2019,5,I can get appointment on the day. Staff are very efficient and helpful. I feel the doctors are high quality.
Orchard  ,I can't understand the check in system,11/5/2018,4,The staff are very kind to myself and my husband. We always attend together as we both now have some mobility issues so we support each other. I can't understand the check in system. My eyesight isn't what it was and I have never used a computer. I always queue to speak with receptionist but their first reaction is to refer me to the check in screen.
Orchard  ,I like that I can get an appointment,11/5/2018,4,This is only my second visit but the staff were all very friendly and helpful when I registered. The phone in appointment system works well and I like that I can get an appointment on the day.
Orchard  ,I like the ring GP ring back,12/16/2019,5,"I see 3 regular doctors and they are all excellent and remember information well. I do like the ring back aspect of the service. I also use the on line booking for appointments, it is brilliant, top marks for a very good surgery."
Orchard  ,I like the telephone/call back system,9/8/2018,3,Why doesn't the surgery use Skype or Facetime? Usually I like the telephone/call back system but for minor issues there must be a less intensive method. Today I really only needed to speak with someone but was told to come in and I am now 25 minutes late being called in. It is pretty good all round but there are niggles.
Orchard  ,I love this surgery!,12/16/2019,5,"I love this surgery, it is all very good I am most impressed. They are very good and helpful on the front desk and also communicating over the phone.  Appointments system good."
Orchard  ,I'm brand new and its excellent so far,12/16/2019,5,I am a brand new patient to this surgery and my experience so far is that it is excellent in all areas.
Orchard  ,Impressed,1/18/2023,3,"I called a bit later in the day and was first in line, I spoke to reception who then booked me an appointment the next day to see a nurse. Whenever I've called I've always got an appointment and the staff are always so helpful arranging or explaining things.  It is possibly more difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor and not having continuity with the practitioner you see can at times affect the care received."
Orchard  ,Incorrect details not been updated,12/16/2019,3,"The surgery declared my husband fit for work to his insurance company just from a phone consultation and having never seen or met him before, subsequently we had to get another doctor from the surgery to support the correct information about his condition and write a new updated letter to the insurance company clarifying that he in fact was not fit for work. We had an apology from the surgery but we have to renew this insurance application regularly and I need the surgery to be informed by the adequate information. We could have lost our income."
Orchard  ,It is just so much better!,11/5/2018,5,"I moved to Newmarket from Hertfordshire a few years ago. Everything about this practice is just so much better than the practice I went to there. Staff are friendly, appointments are available and doctors all seem very good. I wouldn't want to go back!"
Orchard  ,i've always been pleased with this Surgery,8/31/2019,5,"I have always been able to speak to and see a Doctor without lengthy delays, this applies also to the Nurses, my perception is that Orchard House Surgery is a most friendly and helpful service, the Receptionists appear knowledgeable and willing to assist when I telephone."
Orchard  ,Lack of check ups,9/27/2022,4,Although the care provided is good and the staff are great its the processes in place that don''t always work. The phones are very busy and when I've used online access and taken photos and attached them I've had no feedback. I've had no coronary check ups and today is the first COPD check since the beginning of covid. I was very pleased with how the nurse was during my review and she addressed a number of issues which was great.
Orchard  ,Lengthy phone wait,12/21/2021,3,"Phone lines are very busy and I've been cut off when in the queue. I then tried doing an econsult submission which didn't work either so I had to try calling the surgery again. All a bit frustrating but I did get an appointment and issues have been addressed, it's just the wait on the phone that's the issue."
Orchard  ,Like the consistency.,8/25/2019,5,I like the consistency of the same GP. Everyone else is great though. I find the callback system works well.
Orchard  ,Like the triage system,5/31/2022,5,"Generally works very well and being able to use online services is great but it must be remembered it doesn't suit everyone. Changing to the phone triage system is a positive step as it works so well. I also use the online system for ordering prescriptions and that works really well, so much easier.  I have noticed delays with my regular blood test results reaching the surgery, they don't show on the portal for some time."
Orchard  ,Love the appointment system.,6/6/2018,5,I love the appointment system whereby you are able to choose when you wish to be seen. I make online appts for the doctor of my choice to phone me and then we take it from there if I need to be seen later the same day.  Staff and doctors are all first class and very caring attitude when you need it.
Orchard  ,More than satisfied with care,6/28/2018,5,I haven't been a patient anywhere else (here since a child) and I don't need to come very often but I've always been more than satisfied.
Orchard  ,Nightmare getting repeat prescriptions,5/22/2018,4,Medical staff are excellent but yet again I've had problems getting repeat prescriptions. Patient Record indicates prescriptions authorised on 14th May. Phoned chemist today and they are totally unaware of it as it turns out the prescription was never sent electronically by the doctors. Why could someone not have let me know about this in advance? Very poor communication. Now out of tablets!
Orchard  ,No problems at all,12/21/2021,5,"I moved to the surgery 2 years ago and everything has been great. I called for a blood test this morning and got one almost straight away which was really great. All the contact I've had with staff, although limited has been very good too. My prescriptions are always accurate and ready on time as well, so all round a good surgery."
Orchard  ,No problems getting appointments,12/21/2021,4,"I've had no issues getting appointments, I was seen earlier in the week and asked to come back for blood tests. My baby's development checks are being done on time and the maternity support I've had has been great."
Orchard  ,No problems with the surgery,9/27/2022,5,"I've never had any problems with the surgery. When you need to see someone you can get to see them. Last week treatment and care for my husband was very good and it was lovely that the doctor called to check how he was today. The doctor we saw made us feel very relaxed and comfortable, really lovely."
Orchard  ,Nothing to complain about at all,9/8/2018,5,(My) star ratings say it all for me really-nothing to complain about at all-other than high temperature in waiting room.
Orchard  ,Nurses and GPs excellent,5/31/2022,5,So long as you call first thing the triage doctor calls you back promptly and we've been given an appointment with them with in hours of the initial call. The nurses and GPs are excellent and so kind. At the moment it's all working very well.
Orchard  ,Ok apart from getting appointments,4/9/2015,4,Sometimes if I turn to wait without an appointment it can take up to 2 hours. If I manage to get a routine appointment it is often 20 to 30 minutes late when I get seen
Orchard  ,Only issue is limited onsite parking,1/18/2023,5,"The only slight issue is the limited on site parking but across the road is a big car park. I've had no problems getting appointments, even though I spent nearly half an hour on hold trying to get through due to how busy the lines were. Once I was through I was given an appointment easily. The staff are fantastic  and I've also used econsult for certain issues and that have worked brilliantly too."
Orchard  ,Overall happy with care and doctors are good,6/28/2018,4,Children's play toys are used by lots of children and I think they are unhygienic. I preferred the old system for appointments but doctors are good and overall I'm happy.
Orchard  ,Overall very happy with care,6/28/2018,4,"I am nearly 25 minutes late being called in and this isn't unusual. I love the 'phone back' service. When I get a call back, I am reassured I am not wasting anyone's time. Overall, I am very happy"
Orchard  ,patient,5/18/2015,5,polite- time taken to listen and explain-caring attitude from all of the staff
Orchard  ,Perfectly good surgery,12/21/2021,5,"Very good to get appointments as you don't have to wait long to be seen. I haven't had any issues and the staff are very pleasant, very nice people."
Orchard  ,Phone at 8.00 works well for me,11/5/2018,5,The 'phone at 8.00' for an appointment on the day system works well for me now that I no longer work. It was difficult when I did work because 8.00 was when I started work and I couldn't take a call back. On the day is great but the option of making a routine appointment for seven days time would also be good.
Orchard  ,Phones are busy,12/21/2021,4,"You can spend a long time on the phone, I was 10th in the queue last time but the GP called me back quickly and then arranged for me to have an appointment today, so all worked well."
Orchard  ,Poor mental health support,9/29/2022,3,I haven't found the mental health support for me very good at the surgery and the support from Suffolk wellbeing is very limited.
Orchard  ,Process worked well for me,1/23/2019,5,This is a one-off visit to this practice as I am a visitor to the area (from Australia) so I have no history at the practice. I am only here for two weeks so it is frustrating that I am unwell for part of that time but the surgery has looked after me very well which I appreciate.
Orchard  ,Professional and safe,12/21/2021,4,I phoned yesterday about an issue but couldn't come in straight away as I was working but an appointment was booked for today which was really accommodating. I find the staff professional and its nice to have seen cleaning taking place to make it safe and sanitized.
Orchard  ,Quick and very efficient,7/3/2021,5,"(Orchard House Surgery)

My husband and I had different times but rung and was told we could attend together. Greeted at the door, given some information and then straight in to the nurse. Injection given and out all in about 5 minutes."
Orchard  ,Quick appointments,8/24/2022,5,I find the surgery are good at responding to any enquiries and if you call with a problem they will get you seen straight away. The doctor I see is great and I like that they know me and my conditions and understand my concerns. They put a quick referral through to the hospital and I was seen with in the week which was amazing.
Orchard  ,Quick call backs,12/21/2021,5,Rang this morning the GP called me back really quickly and then called me in for an appointment. Staff have been good at all levels and I'm really happy with everything.
Orchard  ,Quick to arrange,12/21/2021,5,"I called the surgery to book my flu vaccination and it was quick to arrange. I've turned up on the wrong day but staff have kindly agreed to still see us and squeeze us in, brilliant."
Orchard  ,Really happy with the surgery,12/21/2021,5,"If its an emergency they see you really quickly. Econsult has worked really well for non urgent issues and the staff have been great, very quick to get appointments and pick up blood forms."
Orchard  ,Really very good.,9/8/2018,5,"Really, everything is very good-could do with a lick of paint though. Clinically everything has always been first class."
Orchard  ,Really wonderful surgery,1/18/2023,5,"Its a really wonderful surgery where all my check ups are done on time  and well. They look after me really well and staff are easy to talk to. Since moving to the practice my quality of life has improved so much as they have listened and addressed the issues I was experiencing. I'm always seen quickly and they will ring me up to check how I'm getting on. I do see different doctors at times but the the care is equally as good and everything seems to fall in to place and works well. The medication delivery that is now available is a really useful service to have. Nothing needs to change, I can't praise them enough."
Orchard  ,Reasonable access,5/31/2022,4,"I prefer to phone to get appointments and you don't have to wait too long to get through to reception. They then arrange for a doctor to call you back, mostly this has addressed the issues I've had and I've not needed many face to face appointments."
Orchard  ,Runs very well,12/21/2021,5,Never had any issues with appointments and my prescriptions are ready each month with no problems. Staff have also been very good and it all runs very well considering the current situation.
Orchard  ,Same day appointment - great service.,8/18/2019,5,A truly professional service that goes against the perception of long waits for appointments. The team are very punctual and a joy to deal with. Staff turnover is negligible which suggests the surgery is as good a place to work at as it is for patience too.
Orchard  ,Specialised diabetes GP,12/24/2019,4,The specialised GP who deal with diabetes are very good. I like the appointment system at least you get to speak to doctor on the day.
Orchard  ,Staff are great,12/21/2021,4,"All been ok. Getting general appointments and blood tests has been quick to arrange and staff are all great, kind and friendly"
Orchard  ,Staff were very welcoming,9/8/2018,5,This is my first clinical visit. but my registration was made very easy by the very welcoming staff. I had an introductory visit and that impressed me.
Orchard  ,Suits me well,1/23/2019,5,This surgery suits me well. This is an ‘on the day’ appointment which is good for me. I don’t come often and whenever I do it is for different things so I don’t mind that I see a different doctor/nurse on each visit. They all seem good to me.
Orchard  ,Surgery has been good to me,8/25/2019,5,"Surgery has been good to me and I feel looked after. Doctors and nurses are very professional and give time, they don't rush you. I can always get an appointment when needed."
Orchard  ,System works well,5/31/2022,5,"The system works really well for us. You get seen on the same day and I've found econsult works very well and avoids calling the surgery. The staff are all great, really friendly and helpful."
Orchard  ,The best surgery,1/23/2019,5,"I think this is the best surgery in Newmarket, which is why I am registered here. Everybody - right through - is really professional. They can always seem to fit you in if you need an appointment but often I can get whatever it is that I need without having to see a doctor, which I think is great."
Orchard  ,The best surgery in Newmarket,12/16/2019,5,"Lovely staff here, so helpful and friendly, its a very good surgery, the best in Newmarket. You can always speak with a doctor on the day which is brilliant."
Orchard  ,The doctors are all fine,11/5/2018,5,"The doctors are fine but the receptionists are sometimes not very friendly on the 'phone. It is ok face to face so it maybe that they are under pressure because everyone rings at 8.00! There has never been a time when I couldn't get an appointment on the day which is great. If, when I see the doctor or nurse, I am told to come back in a week I can't make that appointment until the following week, on the day. This is a nuisance rather than a real obstacle though."
Orchard  ,They have found me an appointment,1/23/2019,5,"I don’t come here very often but I feel very poorly today and they have found me an appointment (on the day). The booking process doesn’t work that well for me though, it is difficult for me to take a triage telephone call while I am at work. I don’t suppose there is any booking process which suits everyone though."
Orchard  ,This is a very friendly surgery!,9/8/2018,5,"This is a very friendly surgery, Everyone always seems to have a smile on their face. I can see a Nurse/Doctor easily enough when I need to and the call back system works well for me."
Orchard  ,Top notch Doctor & appointment system works,6/28/2018,5,Appointment system works fine provided I switch my phone to ring. I have a top notch doctor.
Orchard  ,Triage easy,9/27/2022,5,"I found it quite easy to get through to the surgery today and the traige process was good too.  The doctor called me back quickly and then I've been given a face to face appointment with them, its worked well."
Orchard  ,Triage not easy as a carer,9/27/2022,5,"I call for appointments for Dad, but the triage aspect isn't easy in our situation as I need to be available to accompany him to appointments as he struggles to hear eveything that is said especially on the phone. When the consultation is on the phone I then have additional questions but have not heard the whole conversation as the doctor has been talking to Dad. I'm ok to take photos for dad and send them off, but he couldn't do this on his own. We've had a planned appointment with a nurse today and the care has been very good and the appointment easy to get. Referrals have happened quickly following photos being sent in online work so well if Dad was having to do it all himself. It would be great to have information on the website that is easily found to explain what the disabled access to the surgery is and whether there is a drop off point in the surgery where I can leave him while I go and park the car."
Orchard  ,Triage worked well,12/21/2021,4,I haven't found getting through to the surgery a problem and the phone triage worked well and resulted in a face to face appointment with a doctor. The staff are really friendly and the whole system seems to have improved over the last few years.
Orchard  ,Triaged a week ago,5/30/2022,2,"I've found it difficult to get seen face to face. I spoke to a GP and was triaged a week ago but have not been seen until today which I feel is too long. I don't always feel I'm seeing the right person, I had a dressing that needed changing and was given an appointment with a GP so I had to rearrange another appointment to see a nurse.  I have been having issues with my prescription. Since moving to the practice 6 months ago it has never been correct and I've not been given the training to do specific injections I now have.  The time to discuss complicated issues is limited, the first thing said is that they only have 10 minutes."
Orchard  ,Unable to get child appointment,1/16/2023,3,With the children I've called twice first thing and not been able to have an appointment. When I've finally had a call back at about 4.30 I've been told there are no appointments available and was then directed to 111 and had to go through that process. I've found that for routine issues it works fine as you can book those appointments ahead of time but on the day or more urgent issues have been more problematic. The care once you're in is very good.
Orchard  ,Very good,9/13/2022,5,The service is very good and I can get appointments well. I'm quite happy to see any of the doctors or nurses and I mainly see the nurse for my reviews. I don't feel anything really needs to change at the surgery it works well and always has.
Orchard  ,Very Good,5/31/2022,5,"I've been with the surgery for a long time and it's very good, however, I do feel we are losing the personal relationships with GP's as they seem to be leaving. Those that are here are great I just miss them knowing me and my condition. The nurses are great, so friendly and helpful, absolutely terrific, she knows me very well.  Its a very accommodating practice and during covid they put special arrangements in place for me."
Orchard  ,Very good,12/21/2021,4,Once you get through on the phone the surgery is very good. Econsult works well and the staff are friendly and helpful.
Orchard  ,Very good practice,7/8/2022,4,I have been a patient for many years now and it has always been a very good practice. Very accessible and welcoming.
Orchard  ,Very good service,12/16/2019,5,"Very good surgery, appointments are really easy to access and you always get to at least speak to a GP on the day."
Orchard  ,Very good to me.,5/31/2023,4,The surgery are very good to me. I can make an appointment (say for routine bloods). I walk in and get an appointment the same day or they book for me. Most of the staff are very helpful. I'm always referred for visits to the hospital and they get my scans from e-consult. I paid private for a procedure to be done with the same NHS consultant - this was good as I got to chose which consultant. I don't use online it is frustrating.
Orchard  ,Very happy,5/31/2022,4,I'm lucky I don't need to visit the surgery much. I called today for an appointment and was given an appointment with a GP very quickly and have come straight down so from my point of view its all worked very well.
Orchard  ,Well looked after,9/8/2018,4,"There is usually a bit of a wait to be called in to the consulting room. I'm happy enough here, in fact I was called in for this appointment by the practice which I think is good."
Orchard  ,Works very well for me,3/12/2018,5,The call back/triage system works well for me. I have a recurring condition which is treated with anti-biotics. I 'phone in when I get the start of an episode and they make arrangements for me to be able to call in and pick up my prescription. On the very unusual occasion that I have something else wrong with me I have received very prompt treatment/advice.
Orchard  ,Works well,7/13/2023,4,Getting appointment works well as it's mainly on the day. I've used econsult and had very quick repsonses when I've sent photos through and had a call back and had an appointment the same day.  When I did speak to a doctor about ear problems they advised I should go and have the wax removed and have a hearing test at somewhere like specsavers but when I did this the Suffolk provider said I needed to go to a Cambridgeshire service and then they said no it should be a Suffolk provider who did the test.  I think the difficulty was caused because I live in Cambridgeshire but my GP Practice is in Suffolk.  In the end the Cambridgeshire service did everything that I needed.  Just a shame surgeries don't offer the wax removal any more.
Orchard  ,Works well with a toddler,5/31/2022,5,"Econsult has made access a lot easier as you get seen quickly and don't have to spend time on the phone. I did one first thing this morning, spoke to a GP and have been given an appointment before lunch. I find it a much better way of getting an appointment, works so well and I'm happy that you get the call and are offered an appointment when it's needed."

Orchard Street,A cut above the rest,1/17/2016,5,"Compared to the stories my friends and family tell me about other GP practices, Orchard street is miles ahead in service. You can always get an appointment, waiting times are fairly minimal (and always communicated to you), the GPs are friendly and knowledgeable as are the nurses and the reception staff too."
Orchard Street,Appalling,9/16/2015,1,Staff are rude and give misleading or just plain wrong information. Have made several complaints which are either not acknowledged or responded to with an unsatisfactory reply! I would not recommend to anyone.
Orchard Street,Both GP and Nurse very helpful,8/31/2016,5,Having heart problems and diabetes I have found the GP and Nurse to be very helpful and accessible when I need to see them.
Orchard Street,can't get appointment won't come out,2/15/2021,1,"very very poor service. it used to be good, they won't answer phone, make appointments, call you back or even administer the covid vaccination. 0/10"
Orchard Street,Change of tablets confused me,10/5/2016,4,"They are very helpful and I get taken along with my family as they do not come to see me in my sheltered housing. Sometimes they make changes to my medication, and so when I get it I get confused as I am visually impaired. When delivered, no one tells you there have been changes, so you are unsure if there has been a mix up."
Orchard Street,Difficult getting access,9/28/2022,2,Difficult for us to access. Told to go online for things. I can but my parents cannot and do not speak English. It is just a battle for everything for them.

Orchard Street,Doctors are very good,12/14/2017,5,Doctors are very good at the surgery. They are lovely
Orchard Street,Drs are sensitive to my level of English,11/16/2016,4,"It is easy to make emergency appointments. I used to take my husband to translate for me, now I do not. The doctors speak slowly to me and may use sign language eg. Once I did not understand the word 'iron' and they pointed to some metal. The GP has also offered me the use of language line in the middle of an appointment. The doctors give good explanations. The children love the play area. I don't think I have ever had a letter for cervical screening. So I will ask the receptionist about it."
Orchard Street,Easy to get appointment,8/16/2018,5,I had an ear infection. I saw the nurse practitioner who gave me antibiotics and it cleared. Easy to get appointment - I'm self-employed. I got to the surgery a bit early and I was seen early by the nurse which was great.

Orchard Street,Fed up with it,4/11/2021,1,"I am just fed up of not getting through and when I finally do they say as they are still restricted under the rules it doesn't need immediate attention, yet I am worried and feel like they are palming me off and I am giving up. How long is it before it does need attention? They have no idea how long it is that I have tried to ask to see someone about it. It is months and month.
(signposted the patient to 111/GP+)"
Orchard Street,Feel reassured now,1/11/2016,2,Whole body healthcheck - saw nurse I think.  I was worried as dad and sister died of heart attacks and I went asking for checks.  They were really good.  Checked my heart and everything.  Feel reassured now
Orchard Street,Follow up needed,12/10/2022,3,"We were told to ring in by the hospital for a follow up appointment with our GP. Receptionist was extremely rude saying that all the appointments were gone today and to call back at 1pm. If all the appointments had gone, what is the point in ringing later?
Seeing a Nurse practitioner today and she is always lovely."

Orchard Street,good with an issue,6/14/2016,4,Need to do home visits as I have no way of getting out much
Orchard Street,Good. Don't always see GP of choice but easy to get appointments generally.,1/8/2017,4,I very rarely go to the GP surgery so when I go I visit a doctor.

Orchard Street,GP made me feel uncomfortable.,6/8/2016,1,"I am not happy with one of the GP's at Orchard Street because they asked me how long I had lived in the UK, implying my English should be a lot better. I had been here about six months. They did use language line, but I was made to feel uncomfortable. I have used another GP there before and had no problems."
Orchard Street,Great to be able to have double appointments,6/1/2015,5,I can always ask my surgery for a double appointment which is great. Having the extra time means that i don't then run over and cause others a delays.
Orchard Street,Helpful GPs.,7/15/2016,4,Helpful GPs.  I use my phone to help me understand.  I like the surgery.  The GPs are helpful.  My English is limited.  I use the dictionary on my phone before I go and during the appointment.  I did not know about language line.
Orchard Street,I find the doctor very rude,10/8/2016,2,"As someone with PD, a sleeping disorder and Mental health problems I find that the doctors do not listen to me and can be really rude to me. It is always so difficult to get an appointment and it is stressful trying to do so."

Orchard Street,Lost my tests,1/30/2018,3,"They lost my urine and blood tests whilst I was pregnant in the early stages of pregnancy. I had to have them again and then ended up unwell in hospital. I had a miscarriage and the hospital stated that there were two lots of tests on the system showing I had a water infection. I feel this could have contributed to my miscarriage and will never know.
In my post natal check she clearly googled the questions to ask me to see if I was depressed. The team at the hospital were amazing.
I find some staff to be very rude a the practice."
Orchard Street,Most staff are nice but rude receptionist,3/2/2022,3,"Most staff are nice, but the appointment system is frustrating enough without being hung up on after 20 minutes waiting, then waiting another 15 minutes with no apology, only sarcasm and an unhelpful attitude. I've also had to chase an overlooked referral for my dad 3 times. Finally, from January 2020 I have had breast cancer and was not called once, not even follow up. Rude receptionist and lack of follow up."
Orchard Street,Mostly good experiences however not always,10/12/2015,3,"Overall had good experiences, however couple of times felt like I was being talked to too jokingly during conversations about things which i already found hard to talk about (re mental health) haven't had any problems since requesting change of doctor. staff friendly and waiting times are not too bad"

Orchard Street,No toilet for three weeks,9/25/2018,4,There was no toilet for three weeks. There is often no soap but that may be because people are stealing it. There seems to be a lot of part time doctors-you can't pre-book so are told to call back on the day that the appointment is needed ( for example if a doctor/nurse tells you to come back in a week). They are working to get on the day appointments

The diabetic nurse is really good, she is in email contact with us advising helping to manage the diabetes. I really can't fault them. Prescription ordering online is really straight forward and easy to do."
Orchard Street,Really glad I'm there,5/8/2015,5,Really glad I'm there. Better than Hawthorn drive where I had appalling service and treatment.
Orchard Street,Remarkable!,3/18/2016,5,I am a carer for my husband and he needed to see the doctor. I called and we were seen on the same day-very good! Lots of tests were carried out and some medication prescribed. The Dr phoned the DIST team that day and a package of care was arranged. This is now in place.
Orchard Street,Same person request,9/28/2022,3,"Don't get to see the same person so no continuity. Been unwell for few months and not seen same person twice. Had a nurse ring who stopped my medication but I was in the 'out of hours' 2 days later as rang 111 in the night as unwell. They recommended to go back on the medication, with phased withdrawal and/or a change to alternative. Once this happened I was ok, but felt a GP would have made that call at the start."
Orchard Street,Social prescribing,8/4/2016,4,Can you consider social prescribing?
Orchard Street,Some doctors listen,8/9/2016,5,Some doctors listen attentively and respond to all questions and some doctors do not.
Orchard Street,Staff can be dismissive,1/11/2016,1,"Receptionists quite helpful and nice.  Book appointment - got in straight away.  Nurses quality of care 4/5.
0/5 for the GP I saw.  Staff quite dismissive  I've never seen the same person twice.  I went about blood pressure as I thought it was high (family history of high gp)  I gave GP my 2 readings( previously with these type of readings I've been told to keep it monitored )  GP told me I was a ""fit young lady"" - blood pressure needs to be higher before you worry.
I felt he dismissed me."
Orchard Street,The reception staff are rude,4/28/2022,1,"The reception staff speak very loudly, quickly and are aggressive. They speak over patients, without listening . They do this even when people are polite to them."
Orchard Street,They care about their patients,8/16/2018,5,No wait to book my appointment. They care about their patients and are there to help people. GP was there for me when my husband passed away.
Orchard Street,Toilets were vandalised and shut for a week,9/26/2018,4,The toilets were vandalised and shut for a week. I had to be referred to Riverside for a blood test but I live just across the road from Orchard Street and I am 85 and can't travel easily
Orchard Street,Unable to see the same GP,7/16/2015,4,Unable to see the same GP
Orchard Street,Understanding and supportive,6/20/2017,5,"Even though appointments are difficult to get if you want to see a particular doctor, the doctor I see is really great, very understanding and supportive."
Orchard Street,very accomodating,1/8/2018,4,"Fairly quick to get appointments, you can talk to staff well and they are very accomodating. They keep to time and things go smoothly."
Orchard Street,very good care,7/24/2017,5,"Very good care, act very quickly if I start to feel that I need more help mentally. Initially the referral in to get help was handled very quickly and I was really listened to."
Orchard Street,Very good when I was poorly,9/26/2018,4,I have been a patient here since 2013. They have always been very good when I have been poorly. Once when I was quite bad they called an ambulance to take me to hospital
Orchard Street,"Very welcoming, but medication mix up",10/5/2016,5,"When I need an appointment, I generally can get one and I find them very welcoming. On one occasion though when I picked up my prescription, they had added an additional water tablet, and they had not seen or spoken to me. I rang them to query it as it concerned me."
Peninsula,A lot of positives,4/29/2022,5,"Staff are always polite and extremely helpful both on the phone and in person.Beautiful atmosphere. Calm and clean. I have never had a problem getting an appointment, usually very promptly. Concerns are listened to, treatments or medications explained."
Peninsula,A very caring surgery.,11/13/2017,5,Our practice is truly wonderful. The staff listen to you and genuinely there to help.
Peninsula,A very good service,12/4/2023,5,"When I call, I do not wait too long and you can generally get in on that day or within 2 days of your query. The service for me is very good and the staff are doing their best in some very challenging situations."
Peninsula,A warm and hospitable surgery.,11/13/2017,5,Always very friendly and helpful. Great to have the message appointment reminder.
Peninsula,"Absolutely delightful staff, so very helpful",11/15/2018,5,"Friendly reception staff, always try to help. GPS listen. Dispensers go the extra mile."
Peninsula,Advance booking,4/28/2022,3,It's impossible to book an appointment in advance with a doctor who knows you
Peninsula,Alderton surgery,1/11/2019,5,Most of the staff helpful but the odd persons are quite rude and unhelpful. Brilliant service overall.
Peninsula,Alderton Surgery,10/21/2019,4,Very Good
Peninsula,Alderton Surgery,10/21/2019,5,So far so good. See nurse regularly and GP if I need to.
Peninsula,Alderton Triage Terrible,10/2/2020,1,"New triage system is terrible.  Absolute refusal to listen to your symptoms, even if they are getting worse. Treated as paranoid encouraged to call 111 and go to a&e rather than allow you to see a Dr."
Peninsula,All settled now,4/28/2022,5,"I have found the practice to be very helpful, the pandemic put a strain on everyone but after a shaky start where I was sent to Ipswich for my blood tests, it all settled down and I got back to the local surgery. Thank you to all the staff , it's great having Hollesley surgery back too."
Peninsula,All very lovely,12/4/2023,5,"The staff are all very lovely; reception and clinical staff alike. Try do their best to help you. My so-called 'annual health check' is 2 years on from when it should have been, however, if any issues have occured, I have been seen for them."
Peninsula,Always been good,10/20/2016,4,My own experience has always been excellent but I only see my own doctor.
Peninsula,Always caring,4/28/2022,5,"Always very efficient, compassionate and caring."
Peninsula,Always helpful,10/17/2016,5,Always helpful and appointments easy to obtain
Peninsula,Always kind,4/28/2022,5,Always very kind and considerate
Peninsula,Appointment system has changed,2/12/2019,1,"Have to explain to receptionist why you want appointment, who then tells you the dr will ring back within 2 hrs . No confidentiality. One member of staff was really rude for no apparent reason . Can’t get person / doctor you wish to see . In all the years I have been with the practice , I have never had reason to complain until now."
Peninsula,Availability of blood test facilities at my u,1/11/2019,5,I had to travel from Alderton to Orford for a blood test. I didn't know where the site was. Hopefully next time I can have it done at Alderton as it's quite a drive for me to go to Orford. I might consider moving to Woodbridge.
Peninsula,Booking in advance,4/28/2022,4,The service is very good not quite to pre covid but very helpful.   Appointments still a bit confusing as trying to book ahead cannot always be done.
Peninsula,Cannot fault it,4/29/2022,5,"Moved here few months ago from outside Suffolk with no health problems. It was then discovered I have something quite serious, and I cannot fault the care I have received from your practice."
Peninsula,Care navigation makes sense,6/4/2018,5,We understand why we are asked questions by the receptionist. It makes sense to utilise staff that have the skillset to tell you and that doesn't always need to be a GP.
Peninsula,Caring and compasionate staff,7/3/2019,5,"Responsive to patient's needs, nothing too much trouble, always cheerful."
Peninsula,Clinic mix up,4/28/2022,4,"Difficult to see a GP
I’ve been Called to a COPD clinic though I don’t have COPD. However I do have asthma but I’ve not been called to an asthma clinic"
Peninsula,Communication,4/28/2022,4,"Very useful to have a patient option of e consult, telephone or face to face.
There has been a misunderstanding of when I thought an appointment was telephone and the practice thought it was face to face, i was then seen as a missed appointment! The text messages need to be more explicit."
Peninsula,Communication,4/28/2022,4,Let down by very poor communication to patients.
Peninsula,Consistent,4/28/2022,5,Always available friendly and prompt
Peninsula,Constant change of GP,4/29/2022,1,"Constant change over of doctors, they don’t seem to listen, it is very difficult to get appointments, especially in Hollesley. Referrals to specialists are rare."
Peninsula,Content with service given.,11/13/2017,4,"This surgery is overall very good. I do sometimes have a bit of a wait at appointments, but I know this cannot always be helped."
Peninsula,Convenient,4/28/2022,5,"Easy to get an appointment. Friendly, helpful staff. Not far to travel."
Peninsula,Dexa scan follow up,4/28/2022,4,Disappointment that wasn’t allowed a follow up Dexa scan as aged 70 when treatment finished. Therefore have no idea whether the treatment worked. My sister who lives 15miles away and under a different practice has had two post 70.
Peninsula,Different GP's,4/28/2022,4,"General healthcare professionals great, but get different doctors every visit"
Peninsula,Difficult due to work/school,4/28/2022,3,It is very difficult to get convenient appointments for myself (as I work) and for my children (who attend school). This is particularly true for face to face appointments which can only be booked in the morning at a time when we are heading out to work/school. Waiting in the phone cue would make us late for school/work. It would then be difficult to arrange to get to a face to face appointment during work/school hours.
Peninsula,Difficult to get to other site,4/28/2022,2,"Trying to plan an appointment is very difficult.
Having young child in house hold it is very unhelpful to be sent to another location that can take up to 45 minutes to drive to if they are unwell."
Peninsula,Disappointing,4/28/2019,3,"Finding it difficult to get past the reception for an appointment, I rarely visit the surgery luckily, but recently I have felt pretty unwell with non specific symptoms but because I can’t explain what is essentially wrong I can’t get an appointment . This surgery has always been excellent in the past but feel standards are dropping, dislike discussing symptoms with unqualified reception staff making decisions as to whether or not u can be seen,"
Peninsula,Do their best for you,4/28/2022,5,Friendly and sympathetic staff and practitioners who listen to patients problems and do their best to provide relevant follow-up treatment and referrals.
Peninsula,Doing their best,4/29/2022,5,"Pleasant, caring staff doing there best in difficult circumstances"
Peninsula,Don't see same person,4/28/2022,4,Prescription ordering has improved. Never seem to see the same doctor twice.
Peninsula,"Efficient, warm and expert.",8/29/2019,5,"A big thank you to the staff for looking after my wound caused by extreme allergic reaction.  Brilliant service and also good old fashioned pragmatic advice (rest, fresh air etc).  Very impressed."
Peninsula,Excellent,4/28/2022,5,"Excellent, professional and friendly service"
Peninsula,Excellent,10/17/2016,5,"Never had any problems.  Always get an appointment, they never turn you away"
Peninsula,Excellent,10/17/2016,5,"Any time my husband with cancer,COPD, hernia or shoulder problems, they have been there for us"
Peninsula,Excellent,10/17/2016,5,Surgery is outstanding.  111 service very good too.  Have to have good service and look after myself well as ambulance takes at least 30 minutes to get here
Peninsula,Excellent,10/17/2016,5,Very friendly and warm surgery which is what you need
Peninsula,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"The staff are all great, friendly and approachable, making the experience good.  Getting an appointment has never been a problem and waiting times are usually very good"
Peninsula,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Very good surgery, never have a long wait, go the extra mile.  They are always really accommodating with the elderly"
Peninsula,Excellent Surgery,6/26/2023,5,I can get an appointment when I need one.  The GP referred me for X-ray very quickly. Kind and friendly staff
Peninsula,Excellent surgery,6/26/2023,5,"All excellent. Surgery generally runs within 5 minutes of you appointment time. I have had occasional stern speaking receptionists who must have been having a bad day, as usually they are lovely. I do not think there is a Male GP available (if there is one at all, I am unsure) and sometimes my partner would prefer to see a male, so it would be good to get that option if there is one in a neighboring practice. Just for some things he would prefer it, just as for some things I prefer to see a female GP."
Peninsula,Face to face,4/28/2022,4,Hard to get an appointment to see someone face to face
Peninsula,Fairly quick service.,11/13/2017,5,I need to see my GP every couple of months. Each time it tends to take a couple of days to get me an appointment and I think that is good.
Peninsula,Fantastic,4/28/2022,5,"Communication is key to this fantastic practice they have time for staff & patients, they support the community and have continued to provide excellent service in past 2 years"
Peninsula,Fantastic surgery on all aspects.,11/13/2017,5,I can not think of anything to ask for them to improve on. The surgery is very good. Staff are always kind and friendly
Peninsula,feel pushed aside,4/28/2022,3,I would like to be able to see a doctor without all the fuss to go through to see him I feel because of my age 83 I am pushed aside and the doctors don't want to know
Peninsula,'Few extra hoops',11/1/2019,4,"Apart from 'jumping through a few extra hoops' to ultimately see a GP/Nurse Practitioner. I find this surgery excellent, friendly, welcoming and caring."
Peninsula,friendly but like same person,4/28/2022,4,"The appointment system means that they fill up early in the day and if your problem isn't urgent you can't make one for a day or two ahead.  
It would be good to see the same doctor each time, but with the booking system not allowing you to book ahead that generally isn't possible.
Every time I have had a phone or in person appointment it's been with a different person.
The service is friendly though receptionists could be better trained - I was directed to a pharmacy for an ointment which was unsuitable and later it was found - by telephone - I needed a prescription, and the condition had got a lot worse. Also, on another occasion I should have been told that I could access earwax removal privately.  
Satisfied on the whole.  If I needed it more I probably wouldn't be....and with the appointment making problems I do put off going, and am putting up with several niggling things that really should be dealt with."
Peninsula,Get appointment,4/28/2022,5,"Always got an appointment, by phone or face to face with in a week"
Peninsula,Getting use to Care Navigation,9/19/2018,5,"You get an appointment when you need one and if I ever need a referral, they are always quick to do that.  I understand the reasons for the Care Navigation process, and I m getting used to it.  Depending what is wrong, I do not always want to tell Reception why I am calling though.  Staff however are always polite and kind."
Peninsula,Good care,10/17/2016,4,Lots of people in waiting room;  need more doctors
Peninsula,Good communication,4/28/2022,5,Communication is good. Easy to make an appointment
Peninsula,Good it's currently all change,1/14/2020,4,I was able to speak to (name removed) and my preferred doctor but she's now 20mls. away and if we need to see her that's a long way to travel. I've yet to establish whether it is going to be possible for us to see a doctor new to our surgery rather than just speak first time on a telephone. We both unfortunately have ongoing conditions that need a rapport with a GP.
Peninsula,Good range of services,4/29/2022,5,Still offering a comprehensive range of services in these difficult times.  We are especially lucky to have this in a rural area with such an elderly population
Peninsula,Good response,4/29/2022,5,Whenever I have had a need for medical care or help I have had a rapid and friendly response.
Peninsula,Good service,4/28/2022,4,"I have had good service from Alderton surgery, but then I have relative little contact with the surgery. I might have to learn, myself, to follow up health issues not quite dealt with to my satisfaction."
Peninsula,GP's excellent,4/29/2022,5,"The GPS are all excellent, kind and supportive"
Peninsula,Great overall,4/28/2022,5,"""Great overall experience received from reception staff to clinicians, doctors & nurses.
Generally able to get an appointment without too much waiting.
The only criticism would be one particular member of staff in the dispensary who isn't the most welcoming, does not always acknowledge you when you arrive & comes across as quite rude & condescending at times."""
Peninsula,Great staff,4/28/2022,5,"Brilliant staff, friendly, polite, capable"
Peninsula,Had to explain twice,4/28/2022,2,Nurse was fantastic but reception staff answering the phone and pharmacy not friendly and difficult. Told could not have an appt face to face had to explain twice it was for a smear test.
Peninsula,Happy with the efficiency,6/5/2018,5,Very efficient. I needed a blood test urgently and so came to Peninsula. Usual surgery in Alderton.
Peninsula,Happy with whatever staff member I see,6/4/2018,5,GP very good good at seeing me when I absolutely need to. I understand that seeing nurse practitioner may also be appropriate.
Peninsula,Health checks??,4/28/2022,4,"Generally very positive experience in using practice.
However moved to area as approached 60. Now approaching 70- a bit disappointed that preventative health checks not on offer - as had been at previous practice. 
I have underlying predisposition but have had to ask for it to be monitored in past. This predisposition led to a problem so am now monitored well."
Peninsula,Helpful,4/28/2022,5,"Always helpful, able to see someone or speak to someone as soon as possible."
Peninsula,Helpful and polite,4/28/2022,4,"New to practice and been providing my research prescriptions  but am expecting to be called in for blood tests to check on pre-diabetes and hypertension check, so far no issues everyone helpful and polite"
Peninsula,High standards,4/29/2022,5,"Very professional and higher standards.
 My only negative comment would be that after routine or necessary blood tests that the results  are not followed up afterwards.
I need to access my online patient records for results as calling the surgery is time consuming and possibly they have more important issues to deal with. I recently had a referral from my optician as she had a concern and it has not been followed up since.
This is the first time I have felt concerned."
Peninsula,I found the new triage system very positive.,7/1/2020,5,"I telephoned for my child, the GP telephoned me back approx 2.5 hours later to discuss problem, between us we decided that they did not need to be seen but the GP did check back with me later to re-assess. I was reassured, this saved our family an unnecessary trip and the surgery an unnecessary appointment."
Peninsula,Improved,4/28/2022,3,"Things have improved, a little more friendly, present doctors seem to have a little more time to explain things.pharmacy staff not so abrupt and more helpful being able to order repeat prescriptions at the same time as collection helps."
Peninsula,Info for GP's on duty,4/28/2022,4,"There are now sufficient doctors to be able to get appointments by phone or face-to-face.
Not easy to tell which doctors are on-duty to specify which one you want to talk to, to get continuity of treatment."
Peninsula,Informed well,4/28/2022,4,I am always informed by text that my prescriptions are ready a good service.
Peninsula,Initially not good but....,4/28/2022,5,"Initial Aldeburgh appointment, a car crash. Although to be fair, I did mention feeling pain in my kidneys, which may have detailed the initial diagnosis. BUT if I had been listened to ie. pinched vein and obvious shortness of breath, I may not have got progressively worse throughout the following week when I finally got to see the brilliant Doctor in Alderton who joined the dots up by taking the pinched vein more seriously."
Peninsula,Issue medication,4/28/2022,3,The medical people are good but the ones who issue the medication could be much more helpful and pleasant. Makes me feel like I'm an inconvenience to them. They never seem to smile and when help is asked for they don't seem to be willing to do anything but the absolute least amount they have to.
Peninsula,Jump through few hoops,9/19/2018,4,"Apart from 'jumping through a few extra hoops' to ultimately see a GP/Practice Nurse, I find this surgery excellent, friendly, welcoming and caring."
Peninsula,Keeps up to date,4/29/2022,5,"The Practice keeps a watchful eye on me, i.e. informs me when I need a blood test or annual review, and responds immediately and effectively whenever I have some health problem (so far nothing serious!)."
Peninsula,lack of continuity,4/28/2022,4,My only gripe about Peninsula practice and actually most other practices is that it is difficult to see the same GP every time which only encourages a lack of continuity which in turn creates a lack of confidence and trust. That doesn’t detract from the fact that I am sure every GP is doing their best but I just think it’s safer medically if you see the same GP when you are attending for an ongoing issue.
Peninsula,Letter submitted to Village Voices....,7/30/2018,5,"We recently had a workman replacing double glazing in our bungalow and he was unfortunate enough, whilst removing an old unit to get a shard of glass embedded in his hand which caused quite a lot of bleeding.
Whilst he would normally have gone directly to A and E the bleeding was so bad that this would have been impossible. I rang the Alderton Health Centre and they were most helpful, agreeing to see the young man and treated the injury sufficiently to enable him to make his way to the Ipswich Hospital A and E department for further treatment.
I would just like to put on record my thanks to all concerned as I think this is just one instance which showcases the excellent facilities we have on the peninsula."
Peninsula,Like organising an out of hours appointment,12/31/2019,2,"I am not at all impressed at the convoluted way of getting an appointment under the new system.
Its not a convenient service when you're at work. I absolutely hate it!
I don't like having to give so much information at point of call to reception staff. 
I can't think of one good thing to say about it. Preferred being able to book on line."
Peninsula,Lovely people,4/28/2022,5,"Everyone I have had contact with have been polite, understanding ,helpful and  compassionate."
Peninsula,Many good points,4/29/2022,5,"Reception staff listen carefully to your problem and arrange appropriate appointment.
Very accessible.
Excellent staff.
Good prescription service so no need to travel a long way to chemist."
Peninsula,Meet my needs,4/28/2022,5,Has always provided very satisfactory GP services to meet my needs which in general have to date not been too demanding.
Peninsula,Meets my requirements,4/29/2022,5,The practice provides for my requirements without any drama! Especially whilst the NHS is going through a truly extra ordinary crisis
Peninsula,Mixed review,4/29/2022,5,"When you are actually able to get an appointment the doctors are great. 
In the main staff are friendly and welcoming. 
Some staff (*identification removed*) needs to remember that when on the phone in reception area that their voice can be heard - should not be swearing in a public area."
Peninsula,Need to be taken seriously,4/28/2022,3,I was really disappointed by initial reactions to my condition. I had to fight to get heard and be taken seriously.
Peninsula,Need to plan day,4/29/2022,1,As already said bring back booked appointments so you can plan your day ahead or get urgent appointments without having to wait for a doctor or nurse or go into massive details with an untrained medically receptionist
Peninsula,New telephone Triage not working,4/2/2020,3,New triage system poor. Pharmacy staff numbers not increased. They are stressed & medication is not processed in time. Patients are becoming aggressive with the pharmacy. It’s not their fault but they are pharmaceutical point of contact. Usually lovely staff but on 2 occasions stressed .
Peninsula,New to the service,12/4/2023,5,"I am a relatively new patient here. Compared to my previous place in another County, this is excellent. So courteous and you can get appointments within a few days. If it is urgent they get you in straight away and I therefore in my limited experience thus far, cannot fault them."
Peninsula,New triage system is terrible,1/29/2020,3,With the new triage system whereby you have to wait for a GP to call you back I can no longer get an appointment quickly on the day. Before this I would be able to call at 8 and go in to work a bit later if my appointment was say at 9 or 10 but now I have to in to work and wait for a call. If they then want to see me I can only come after work at 5 or 6pm. Not ideal for me if I really need to see a doctor. It seem like this change is all to benefit the practice and not the patients.
Peninsula,No complaints on service.,11/13/2017,5,"I cannot complain about anything, however I do not need to use it very often."
Peninsula,No faults,10/21/2019,5,Cannot fault the surgery. Great care over the years.
Peninsula,No issue,4/29/2022,5,"No issues with the practice at all, staff very professional."
Peninsula,No male doctors or staff,6/18/2019,2,"No choice of male or female doctors no male staff at all I don’t want to explain why I’m at the doctors to a receptionist, the whole place seems to be run as a business not a public service very disappointed."
Peninsula,No personal touch,4/28/2022,2,There seems no trace of a personal touch left and precious little consistency. My wife saw 4 different clinicians for the same issue over 2 months and felt there was little or no communication among them. I've not been offered an appointment with my own GP for 5 years or more. While the pharmacy assistants are pleasant the receptionists can verge on the brusque. The practice seems to lack resources since taking on Aldeburgh.
Peninsula,No problem,4/29/2022,5,"I have never had a problem getting an appointment at this surgery. The online booking facility works well.  I feel very lucky to live in their geographical location. From friends experiences of their surgeries in towns I really appreciate the care that this practice offers. My experience is the GP/nurses are caring and I feel that they really do listen, F2F appointments do not feel  rushed."
Peninsula,Not as good,5/1/2020,1,Everything has changed far better before almost impossible to see doxtor
Peninsula,Not very accessible,8/9/2016,4,Not very accessible
Peninsula,Not very good,11/1/2020,1,"Triage system is not good , You can't see a doctor any more"
Peninsula,nothing but praise,4/29/2022,5,I moved here a year ago and have nothing but praise for the practice. Excellent communication with ongoing issues (ie post cancer support) and managing annual blood test with thorough feedback from GP. Telephone appointments have worked well for me. Also unlike so many GP practices you can make appts to see a GP in a timely manner. I feel the practice actively demonstrates its care for the patient and operates very efficiently. Thank you!
Peninsula,Online is good,4/29/2022,5,"I'm very confident in the practice and how it has provided services online , phone and face to face.  It's good for me to make contact online, without needing face to face."
Peninsula,Overall good,1/22/2019,5,Appointments are fairly easy to book if you don't mind who you are seeing.
Peninsula,Overall very good,4/28/2022,4,Overall very good. Sometimes difficult to get an appointment. Doctors and nurses always very pleasant. Reception sometimes not so. Pharmacy staff excellent.
Peninsula,Perfect for my needs,4/28/2022,5,Having relocated here I’ve found the service offered perfect for my needs
Peninsula,Pharmacy good,4/29/2022,5,Pharmacy is excellent always text when prescription is ready.
Peninsula,Phone call 45mins to get connected,4/5/2021,1,Cut finger needed small amount of glue and dressing told no all small injury to ae how ridiculous 20 mile drive for 5 mins of care been using alderton surgery for 63 yrs worse now than it was 20yrs ago.
Peninsula,Phone rather than see me,4/28/2022,3,"They are too quick to deliver a phone service rather than see somebody, they wanted to do my heart disease review over the phone which would mean no checking of blood pressure etc"
Peninsula,Poor and going down hill fast,6/12/2018,1,"Don’t have appointments when needed, doctors rarely listen to problems just get you in and out of the door as quickly as possible. Require multiple appointments just to resolve one issue which could be resolved if doctors spent more time listening to their patients concerns and issues. Never seem to have medications in stock. Overall contact is pretty poor when waiting for results or prescriptions. Can hear what is going on and being said in consulting rooms when in waiting room breaching patient confidentiality. Never seem to see the same doctor twice therefore lacking consistency in care and providing conflicting advice/ treatments."
Peninsula,Poorly trained staff give incorrect info,2/14/2020,2,"I was told by receptionist staff I must talk to a doctor, when I make an appointment for a doctor to phone I get a practitioner nurse calling. I said I had been told I had to speak with a doctor. A few minutes later a rather irritated doctor calls me and has not read my file and is angry with me for insisting on talking to a doctor. I was told that my blood values were so bad I had to by reception. Very stressful and unpleasant altogether."
Peninsula,Positive,4/29/2022,5,"My, fairly rare, experiences have all been positive"
Peninsula,Prefer a GP callback,9/19/2018,4,"I personally would prefer not to tell reception what is wrong with me. I do not want to be seen as awkward though. I wish I could ask for a GP call back, and so would like that to be more readily available as an option.
If you call in at 8.30am the majority of the time you do get an appointment that day, and you can book in advance still.  So it really is a good surgery from an access point of view."
Peninsula,prescription issue,12/4/2023,3,"I have to get my nasal spray, but there has been supply issues at the dispensary.  It can be an issue as I need it for ongoing condition. There is no way of knowing that there is an issue until you go to pick it up. I feel they need to allow you to put the prescription in sooner to allow for the delivery issues they seem to experience."
Peninsula,Professional,4/29/2022,5,They are very caring and professional. Obviously that makes us as patients more relaxed about visiting this practice.
Peninsula,Professional,4/28/2022,4,"Caring staff, always helpful and professional on the phone when dealing with receptionists. Some telephone appointments with GPs can feel very rushed,  although I understand their workload is enormous ."
Peninsula,professional & friendly,4/29/2022,5,"I’ve been very pleased with the care I’ve received from the surgery. Phone answered  promptly, appointments available when I’ve need one including the option to speak to the Dr on the phone rather than visit the surgery. Each member of staff have been professional and friendly. I would highly recommend this surgery."
Peninsula,quick referral,4/28/2022,5,Am currently being treated for asthma and arthritis and my care has been carefully monitored and treated. Also had bowel problems last year and was referred to hospital and treated very quickly
Peninsula,Really care about you,4/29/2022,5,"Kind, approachable and understanding. They really care about you. I was very impressed that a member of the team called me when I had Covid to check I was ok. I’m not in the vulnerable group or over 70, so it was very appreciated"
Peninsula,Registered easily,4/28/2022,5,"I have moved into the area and became newly registered with the practice. The process was simple, effective, and well supported by admin staff. The only reason I have used the practice so far is for a COVID booster jab; this went well, and was administered professionally."
Peninsula,Reliable Surgery.,11/13/2017,4,A good surgery all round when I need it.
Peninsula,Same day appointment,4/28/2022,5,"Can always get an appt on the same day if needed . Was told I couldn’t book in advance as they were short staffed . I do get to see my requested GP, overall very good service at this present time"
Peninsula,Same GP,4/28/2022,4,It would be good to see the same GP where possible
Peninsula,Satisfied,4/29/2022,5,I've always been able to get an appointment and satisfied with the services and support provided
Peninsula,See GP quickly,4/28/2022,5,"I can see a doctor quickly
I can collect my prescriptions from the surgery"
Peninsula,See someone different,4/28/2022,3,It is not as easy to see a doctor as it used to be and it is always someone different. There is no personal relationship like there used to be.
Peninsula,See someone who knows you,4/28/2022,4,It would be nice to speak to the same doctor ie one who knows you.
Peninsula,set up online,12/4/2023,5,"I am a new patient and reception have been really good at helping get me set up online and explaining the way I access things, as I know it would be easier once I am set up."
Peninsula,Since August this year not happy,9/17/2019,1,Very unhappy about an excellent doctor who had helped me on many occasions had to leave this practice
Peninsula,Since 'expansion',4/29/2022,1,"Since expansion with Aldeburgh it is impossible to get a face to face GP appointment, the service is horrendous and we now go to A & E or 111 if we need GP support. As a family we have no ongoing health issues and therefore feel we are not a priority for the GP service as *text removed as speculative*"
Peninsula,Staff abrupt and unhelpful,8/11/2019,2,"When I have 'had' to use this practice I have always found staff 'abrupt and unhelpful'. I avoid going here, and it is only over the road. I'd rather drive to Orford as everyone is so pleasant at the surgery and the dispensary."
Peninsula,Staff are exceptional.,11/13/2017,5,"I have always found the surgery to be ready to help, when I need it. Staff are always polite and understanding."
Peninsula,Staff are very supportive,6/4/2018,5,"Throughout my time here, I have always felt well supported. Through my time with breast cancer, the GPs were very supportive. I do not like to discuss personal information when there is a male in reception if it is in relating to 'ladies things'."
Peninsula,Staff are very welcoming,10/21/2019,4,Staff are very welcoming and helpful on the telephone. You get a sense that they are one big family.
Peninsula,Suitable appointment,4/28/2022,3,I was unable to record that I could not make a suitable appointment for my needs
Peninsula,Super!,4/29/2022,5,The practice is super & we're lucky to have them in the village
Peninsula,Superb service.,11/13/2017,5,I cannot fault the surgery. Just an excellent service.
Peninsula,Take time for me,4/28/2022,5,"All recent contacts with GPs have been attentive and unhurried, taking time to understand and enquire about my issue. Where necessary further testing/investigation has been done.  Overall I feel very fortunate to have Alderton surgery as my GP."
Peninsula,Telephone system not patient orientated,7/2/2020,1,"I telephoned for a fasting blood test result, at the correct time! I was told ‘it’s satisfactory’ I then informed the resceptionist that this wasn’t sufficient and that given my health issues I needed to speak to a doctor. She told me to phone back the next day so that they could decide who I needed to speak to. Fortunately, the next day i was put on the list for a doctor to phone me who is now referring my situation to someone at Ipswich hospital."
Peninsula,Telephone wait,4/28/2022,4,You can usually get an appointment the same day but the wait on the telephone line to book the appointment is too long sometimes you are 20 something in the queue which is frustrating.  Also not being able to book appointments in advance seems silly to me.
Peninsula,Test results,4/28/2022,4,Main problem is lack of feedback on test results
Peninsula,Thank you,4/29/2022,5,"Whenever I need medical help I've always been able to receive it.

Thank you."
Peninsula,Thanks to (anonymous),8/30/2018,5,For arranging urgent appointment and ringing back
Peninsula,The surgery has been excellent,6/4/2018,5,Have had to come to the surgery everyday this week with children. They are very good at giving the appointment when needed. Referrals to the hospital on an occasion saved my child's life. The diligence of staff was amazing
Peninsula,Thorough,4/29/2022,5,They are very thorough and very caring about getting me well
Peninsula,"Timely, but need continuity",4/28/2022,3,"The practice is really good at providing timely appointments and excellent at letting patients know what's going on.
They could do much better in terms of continuity of care, though. It's pretty much routine that I'll not see the same doctor twice. For long-running problems this means each new GP is reliant on the notes of the previous person. Occasionally they misinterpret what's been written and potential slips are being made. This does not build trust between the patient and the medical staff. I'm sorry to say that my confidence in their abilities is quite low as a result.
Test results are never proactively shared. If you don't ring up and chase a test result you never get it (I still don't know the result of some blood tests I took over a year ago - I just assume that they were fine). When you do ring up for results, one of the team of people who answers the phone gives you your results. I don't think these people are medial practitioners. This doesn't feel right. Especially as one of them seems to take the attitude that a negative test result means that everything is OK and nothing more needs to be done. The truth is quite the opposite, if you have symptoms and the current set of tests are negative, the symptoms need more investigation!
Sorry to seem so negative here. Lots about this practice is spot on. Their communication and support for the entire community was brilliant during the lockdowns and the long slog through the pandemic. I have nothing but admiration for them and what they achieved. But now we're coming out of that medical emergency, I just think they need to have a look at some of the basics and to reformat the way they do things to get things even better."
Peninsula,Too many very good doctors leaving why?,2/25/2020,1,"Finding it very hard to get appointment,no chance if you are ill in the afternoon."
Peninsula,Tortuous process to get an appointment,6/2/2020,3,What a dreadfully convoluted system in order to get an appointment to deal with a routine matter. I realise you need to weed out time wasters but instead we are made to waste time waiting for someone to speak to. Medical care 10/10; customer service 5/10
Peninsula,Treatment and communication is good,6/4/2018,5,Everything really good. All treatment explained well. We didn't get the result we thought but as it was explained so well it put my mind at rest.
Peninsula,Triage system is awful,12/14/2019,1,"Having been referred to see my GP by an A and E doctor the previous evening, I booked a call from a doctor using the online service. The system seems to assign 1 minute triage slots for the doctor to triage a patient. My condition meant I needed lots of information but the doctor seemed rushed and the focus seemed to be on avoiding seeing the patient in person but instead palming me off onto a nurse or another outside agency. The A and E doctor told me I should SEE my doctor but that isn’t as easy as he would think!!"
Peninsula,Triage system is dire,12/27/2019,1,"This used to be an excellent surgery ,and I could book an appointment by phoning or on-line.. no problems.  that has now been scrapped and they have introduced a triage system where you can only get an appointment on the day you phone or visit... getting an appointment now is almost impossible. , phone is always busy , last time I went in to book an appointment the phone was off the hook and laying on the desk. If there are no appointments  available on the day you cannot get one booked for another day .  .. this system is NOT working ..   this is not acceptable !!!!"
Peninsula,Triage system is unfit for purpose,1/19/2020,1,"One can only get an appointment after being grilled by a receptionist to determine if you need to see a doctor, or not,  and if so can only be booked for the same day .. if no slots are available you have to go back or call on the next day and go though the whole process again .. !!"
Peninsula,Triage system worked well with reservations,12/27/2019,3,I actually got an appointment easily the first week the new system started. I could not get an appointment in previous two weeks at all. Doctor I saw was inexperienced but did come back to me two days later recommending blood tests. I was referred through a fast track to hospital. I could not fault this. I have subsequently  called to speak to a doctor and agree with other comments that initial staff contact can be a bit intimidating unless you are completely prepared and assertive.
Peninsula,Triage works well,4/29/2022,5,I’m grateful for a service that when needed it has been there for me. The phone triage system seems to work well and I’ve always managed to get a consult when ill.
Peninsula,unnecessary questions,4/28/2022,4,"Generally always a good experience both by all health care professionals, but when wanting to make an appointment feel maybe some questions asked are not always necessary, and may make some people unable to explain themselves."
Peninsula,used to be fantastic,4/28/2022,2,"The practice used to be fantastic, a proper local GP practice that knew and understood the needs of it’s patients. Since expansion into Aldeburgh it’s difficult to get a GP appointment, your lucky if you see the same GP twice and there is less time given to face to face patient care- it’s all 10 minutes & your time is up, no good attending with more than one concern as you’ll need to book an appointment for each ailment. There is more emphasis on the needs of the practice & what they have to achieve to meet local & national targets rather than the needs of the local population- it’s a real shame as I used to be very proud of our GP service."
Peninsula,Very empathetic,4/29/2022,5,"The surgery provides a fantastic service to my family and me and has done for many years. The best bit is how empathetic the healthcare professionals are, taking time to explain not solely the medical facts, but the all-important broader issues. We're very fortunate to have the surgery offering such a progressive, but traditional rural service."
Peninsula,Very friendly staff,5/1/2018,4,Very friendly staff on my last visit. Bit of a wait. Quick appointment. efficient
Peninsula,Very good,4/28/2022,5,"Consultations, treatment and patient experience are always very good."
Peninsula,Very good service,7/18/2023,5,"I have found this surgery to be so helpful to me, the doctor and the hospital worked very well together, the communication was excellent between them, they got the strong medication that I needed and then they sent me off for an X-ray and I was seen straight away."
Peninsula,Very happy,4/28/2022,5,Always happy with everything to do with the practice
Peninsula,Very helpful,4/29/2022,5,The staff have good attitudes and really helpful on my limited visits. I collect medication for my grandparents who can get  a little confused and the staff are very help.
Peninsula,Very helpful,4/28/2022,5,"Good experience, very helpful, and put your mind at ease"
Peninsula,Very helpful,4/28/2022,5,"Everyone I have had dealings with have been very helpful, polite and generally caring."
Peninsula,Very helpful,4/28/2022,5,All the staff that I have dealt with have been very helpful.
Peninsula,Very poor,4/1/2020,1,"I had a blood test for my underactive thyroid, when the result came back I got a phone call from the doctor to make a appointment for next week as my thyroid was borderline,Try to phone Monday morning line was busy so as i just live near the doctors just walk round and told they were busy, phone tomorrow , Tuesday phone again and phone was busy so walk round and was told they could not give me a appointment as the doctor will need to phone on that day ............ when the doctor phone just put my medicine up without seeing me."
Peninsula,Very responsive,4/29/2022,5,The Practice has always responded well to any health problems I have had during the 7 1/2 years I have lived in Suffolk.
Peninsula,Well cared for,4/28/2022,5,"Always had a good positive experience, and felt well cared for."
Peninsula,Well led,4/28/2022,5,Both face to face and telephone consultations make discussions with practitioners more available in recent times. The Practice has taken a leading role in fighting Covid in East Suffolk.
Peninsula2,10 out of 10 from us,2/12/2019,5,"We have always found this surgery excellent. We really like the new appointment system too. Only 10 minutes away for us and we are retired and drive.
Cannot fault it. ‘10 out of 10’"
Peninsula2,Access,4/21/2022,2,Attitude of receptionists make me feel that I am asking for a favour to access a clinician.  It’s clearly a gate keeping service
Peninsula2,Access,4/21/2022,3,Not always possible to see a Dr. I don't like phone consults
Peninsula2,Accessed whilst on holiday,9/17/2018,5,"We found in our holiday pack the number for the surgery, and we called.  They gave us an appointment for an hours time.  Although running a bit late, probably due to squeezing us in at short notice, so we do not mind.
We really appreciate being able to see someone so quickly."
Peninsula2,Admirable,4/28/2022,5,Wonderful no nonsense care. I am amazed that some have criticised this admirable practice.
Peninsula2,All Good,7/4/2022,4,Find it all good here. The staff are very helpful
Peninsula2,All works ok for my mum,2/12/2019,5,I bring my mum in and she finds the system good as it sometimes means we do not have to make an unnecessary trip.We have to use the community car scheme to get here.
Peninsula2,Always been good,4/28/2022,5,I have always had very good treatment  from all the staff and Dr *name removed*......thank you for all you do.
Peninsula2,Always someone there,4/21/2022,4,When ever I have needed help there has always been someone on the end of the phone or answering emails to help. The phone system could be a little easier to access sometimes long waits for it to be answered.
Peninsula2,Annual reviews,7/4/2022,4,Once the COVID backlog clears I expect my annual reviews to be back in my birthday month and available at my local site.   The staff are good but they need to remember that we are not tasks to be completed but patients who may have a good understanding of our conditions
Peninsula2,Appointment access is fair,5/16/2019,4,"Can get an appointment on the day if you're willing to see anyone, which I understand. I get to see my own GP if I wait for about 2 weeks, which is fine for routine check-ups. I have blood taken regularly too and the HCA is good at this."
Peninsula2,Appointment good,7/4/2022,4,Good appointment both in time and face to face
Peninsula2,Appointment times,4/21/2022,3,They provide an appointment service. This works well. Appointment times not always adhered to by staff though and this can be annoying.
Peninsula2,Appointments still hard to obtain,4/5/2022,2,Inconsistent treatment - never the same practicioner
Peninsula2,Automated answering,7/4/2022,4,"The experience of the practice is first class. However, the impersonal frustrating automated answering service is appalling!
How an older patient or hard of hearing or maybe someone a bit slower in responding is meant to deal with it in my opinion is wrong. A friendly voice belonging to a real person would be much more appreciated!"
Peninsula2,Become more impersonal,4/21/2022,3,Clearly the practice has become more impersonal. There are less GP's available less often at Aldeburgh. Having to order repeat prescriptions every month is a pain. Why can’t I get a larger prescription. Having the speak to a GP regarding my repeat prescription every few times I try to order online is also a pain
Peninsula2,Blood tests,7/4/2022,4,The receptionists and staff are very good . More phlebotomy appointment access at Aldeburgh would be useful as I have to have blood tests regularly for my hematology appointments
Peninsula2,Caring in difficult times,4/28/2022,5,The Practice has performed in a caring and compassionate way during very difficult times.
Peninsula2,Choice,7/4/2022,4,Sometimes you can't see your preferred clinician but I have found all the GPS  nurses etc very helpful.
Peninsula2,Communication could be better,4/19/2018,4,Wish they would tell you when GP is running behind.
Peninsula2,Comprehensive check,7/4/2022,4,The Aldeburgh Practice has greatly improved over the last 18 months. My last annual check (Feb 22) was the most comprehensive since I moved to Aldeburgh a few years ago
Peninsula2,Concerned about inconsistency of care,3/16/2021,3,"Been happy with overall service prescription and general support provided particularly in such difficult times but there are clearly communication issues within and across the practice. For example problems with patient records not being shared due to technological incompatibility with other medical services like ambulance and hospitals which could have serious consequences. I have been experiencing symptoms for 6 months had some tests but only just seen a Doctor and had to start all over again with a repeat of blood tests. I have never before had a problem with a blood test until I moved here. Today after a struggle a more experienced nurse came to the rescue.There appears to be confusion over which needles to use and an oversupply of black ones which I learned are notoriously difficult to use and stop drawing the blood too soon. This is not a criticism of any individuals. The nursing team have all been excellent in their support. It seems to be a staff training, communication and supervisory issue. Who is picking this type of thing up and joining up the dots? I know times have been difficult and very busy but patient confidence is important to address."
Peninsula2,Consistency,4/21/2022,3,"The receptionist team vary in quality. There seems not to be an overall policy of how to interact with patients. Some can be friendly and approachable, but others can be downright rude and intimidating."
Peninsula2,"Consistent access, but many locums",5/16/2019,5,We are able to access the service consistently well. Seeing same GP more challenging as there seems to be a few locums here.
Peninsula2,Consistently excellent,5/16/2019,4,"In for my annual check on my heart, so they d my blood pressure etc. Feel they keep a good eye on me and I find the service consistently excellent."
Peninsula2,Consistently good,5/16/2019,5,Everything consistently good.
Peninsula2,Consistently very good,5/16/2019,4,"I can access an appointment 'on the day' when needed, but today is my regualr blood test. All consistently very good."
Peninsula2,Convenience,4/21/2022,2,No communication just get fobbed off and practically impossible to see a doctor. No availability to even get a flu jab at Aldeburgh had to travel to Alderton
Peninsula2,Convenient,4/28/2022,5,It's local and the staff are very helpful and kind
Peninsula2,Could do tests together,7/4/2022,4,"Generally good but I do get calls for blood tests for several different annual checks. Would prefer doing these all together, save you and me visits, thanks"
Peninsula2,Couldn't take call back,4/13/2023,4,"With a concern affecting my hearing my partner called and was able to secure a call back initially, then appointment. As it was my hearing, I wouldn't have been able to access this myself, but they were happy to talk to my partner. With a number of health issues for last 2 years I have found the service excellent. Glad I stuck with it during the time that they lost many patients."
Peninsula2,Covid vaccine related,4/21/2022,3,"Leiston and Saxmundham surgeries were very proactive with covid vaccinations. This did not appear to be the case with Aldeburgh. I had to drive to Ipswich for both my vaccinations, despite driving past the Leiston vaccination centre everyday to work.
I see no advantage to myself being aligned with other surgeries that at not local to me (Orford, Alderton)"
Peninsula2,Dealt with Covid well,7/4/2022,4,Dealt well over Covid vaccination appointment and worries over vaccines .
Peninsula2,Delayed reviews,7/4/2022,4,"Generally good but seems to have some problems in communication. I was supposed to get an X Ray for my knees but the authority was lost between the local cottage hospital and the surgery. 

I am supposed to have an annual review of my skin cancer but I have heard nothing for 3 years. Covid-19 has certainly been a factor.

I was supposed to have a personal  doctor having reached 75 almost 10 years ago, I still have not met him or received an invitation to do so."
Peninsula2,Diagnostics 2 years on,4/28/2022,2,Was just starting diagnostic tests when first lockdown started - my treatment was cancelled by the practice and I was simply put to one side - I have had no follow up in the last two years - diagnostics were never completed and I have never been able to get past a phone consult despite what I would consider are significant meds being prescribed over the phone - post starting to take these drugs I have had no follow up - I do not feel  cared for by the practice
Peninsula2,Difficult when I work,2/12/2019,4,"I have found the new system difficult when I’m working as the triage eats into your day, sometimes you then get no appointment which is even more frustrating as you have to go through the whole thing again the next day (as I cannot ring for afternoon appointments)."
Peninsula2,Efficient,4/28/2022,5,Very impressed with speed and efficiency of fast tracked referral.
Peninsula2,Efficient and swift,4/28/2022,5,Good communication through updates on the website. Efficient online system for repeat prescriptions with good professional oversight. Swift telephone access to medics when needed.
Peninsula2,Efficient staff,4/28/2022,5,"The phlebotomist who does my blood tests and the nurse practitioner who gives my hormone injections are both competent, efficient and put me at ease"
Peninsula2,Efficiently seen,7/4/2022,4,Made a blood test appointment at short notice - seen very quickly (within two hours) and efficiently (at another of the group’s practices)
Peninsula2,Excellent,4/28/2022,5,"I've always been treated very well,all the staff, doctors,nuses,and reception ,have always been excellent to me .,I would never hesitate to recommend the surgery."
Peninsula2,Excellent,5/16/2019,5,"The surgery allows me to still come here as I now live in Leiston, but have been under this surgery since 1974. Just find it excellent."
Peninsula2,Excellent overall,9/17/2018,5,"This is excellent overall.  Only issue has been, being able to book an appointment with the nurse that is not too far after my blood test.  The system does not allow you to book ahead far enough, so when I have my blood test for diabetes and have to follow it up with seeing the diabetic nurse it can be another couple of weeks before I get to see her. Would think they could look at that as surely it would be best for the nurse to see me closer to when the results came back."
Peninsula2,Excellent responsive service,5/16/2019,5,Only registered last week as a temporary patient. I was able to see a nurse who then made an appointment for me today. Excellent responsive service
Peninsula2,Excellent responsive service,4/19/2018,5,Here on holiday. Called 111 and they directed us to this surgery who said just to come in. Really pleased that we could do that and not have to go all the way to the hospital.
Peninsula2,Excellent service,4/13/2023,5,"This is an excellent service in my experience. I have needed a number of appointments regularly recently, and not seeing the GP of choice, is the only thing I wish could be different. Whoever I do see though is lovely.
Blood request took 10 days, which I think is a reasonable timescale for this. 
I think the staff are very friendly throughout the service. Reception are always trying to do their best to get you what you need if they can that day."
Peninsula2,Excellent service,4/28/2022,5,Very nice and courteous staff. Excellent service received so far
Peninsula2,Excellent service,5/16/2019,5,Excellent service. My partner came for an issue a while ago and they picked up that he had a heart murmur. This was swiftly operated on. He has recovered well and gave us reason to place trust in the service.
Peninsula2,Excellent Surgery,6/26/2023,4,"On the whole the surgery is great. I have managed to see the same GP a couple of times with my newborn, and that helps I feel to feel safe as a new parent."
Peninsula2,Exemplary care & compassionate,12/4/2018,5,Exemplary care in community and compassionate. Very helpful. In a situation around EOL. Good sense of humour and fun.
Peninsula2,Exemplary care in community & compassionate,6/7/2018,5,Exemplary care in community and compassionate. In a situation around EoL. Good sense of humour and fun.
Peninsula2,Extremely poor,1/18/2021,1,"My extremely vulnerable parents in Aldeburgh, a 92 yr old father with terminal cancer and an 85 year old mother with dementia have suffered massively since the practice became the Peninsula practice. They are not able to easily use a computer and to my mind, in what should be a close knit community service, should not have to rely on being computer literate. The receptionists have never been that helpful or gone any step beyond their remit. My parents are now struggling to access support for their coronavirus vaccine, for which I gather they will have to drive to Woodbridge.. is there no one within this practice who can support vulnerable elderly?"
Peninsula2,Felt let down,4/21/2022,3,Felt let down and had to pay for an ultrasound which did not address the problem. Told I needed a different scan and it was expected I would pay for this. So I have not felt like bothering them since. May move to a different practice.
Peninsula2,Felt listened to,4/28/2022,5,GP listened & heard what I needed
Peninsula2,Female GP,4/28/2022,5,"The reception staff are always helpful.
The doctors and nurses have fulfilled their duties well during a challenging two years.
My only regret is not having a designated female GP that I can build a lasting doctor / patient relationship with and that understands and is familiar with my health issues.  
I appreciate that there is a country wide shortage of GPs but the Aldeburgh practice has only one female GP who I understand to be only temporary."
Peninsula2,First rate,4/28/2022,5,In all my experience with the practice I have never had any issues. They are first rate and it is exciting to see the add on services are also first rate. Ie physio
Peninsula2,Follow up,4/21/2022,4,Treatment is good but follow up ie results of tests could be better than if you don't hear its good
Peninsula2,Follow up issues,4/21/2022,2,"Subsequent to submitting my previous BP results as instructed before Christmas to a rather indifferent receptionist I have heard nothing at all. My BP has been in the (figures removed for anonymity purposes, but considered 'high').
I mentioned that the doctor had advised statins well before this but again no follow-up."
Peninsula2,Generally happy with care,4/19/2018,5,"Running behind today. Sometimes the screen tells you this, but today it is not showing anything. Communication just helps."
Peninsula2,Generally very good,9/17/2018,5,"I do not use the surgery very often and so all I can say is that it is very good as I get an appointment when I need one. I have not needed anything further yet, but if I ever do I have confidence that I will get the right treatment."
Peninsula2,Generally very good,12/4/2018,4,Things at this surgery are generally very good. Appointments can run behind often but I do understand this cannot always be helped.
Peninsula2,Generally very good experience,6/7/2018,4,"Things at this surgery are generally very good. Appointments can run behind often, but I do understand that this cannot always be helped."
Peninsula2,Get appointment ok,9/17/2018,4,"You can get an appointment on the day when needed. If I want to see a specific GP I book about 3 weeks in advance, which I understand. They are good at linking up my blood tests (every 2 weeks at the moment) with my medication.  When I have rang up anxious, receptionists have been very kind and also called my local pharmacist so i can then pop in there and get some information for some reassurance."
Peninsula2,Give me confidence,4/28/2022,5,I have confidence in the care/consultations I receive.
Peninsula2,Good as always,7/4/2022,4,The overall experience was as good as it always is.The GP phoned me at the agreed time and was pleasant and helpful.
Peninsula2,Good Booster delivery,4/28/2022,5,"I have used the surgery for my COVID Booster, met at the door, had an explanation what was going to happen and then called through very quickly. Good experience."
Peninsula2,Good care when had reaction,7/4/2022,4,During the covid outbreak there have been a few problems but nothing disastrous. My first two vaccines were astra zenaca and no problems my booster was Pfizer which I reacted badly. The nurse and doctor were brilliant in caring for me.
Peninsula2,Good service,2/12/2019,4,"I do find the service good. As the appoint system has changed it seems to be easier to get an appointment when you need one as the system camps filter the needs of patients much better I feel.
Personally I’ve had a call a couple of times and one of those times things were sorted out over the telephone, which was great as I didn’t feel well to go in."
Peninsula2,Good service overall,2/12/2019,4,"I have been under this surgery many years but may need to change as the appointments system has made it difficult with having to come by bus. The bus service is quite sparse here.
It is frustrating when you ring at 8 then don’t get an appointment as they are all gone so then you are told to call again at 2pm, but the same situation happened.
I said ‘but I did what you asked’.
My GP asks to see me in 2 weeks,but I cannot be guaranteed that that will happen because of this system."
Peninsula2,"Good surgery, staff attitude isn't pleasant",4/19/2018,4,Generally good. Staff can be a little rude.
Peninsula2,good updates,4/28/2022,5,"I am grateful to *name removed*, they gave regular updates on the web regarding COVID vaccination and for the overall health care .The practice arranged shingles jab when I turned 70 and aneurysm checks together with heart, blood pressure checks as part of Well man checks"
Peninsula2,Greatly improved,7/4/2022,4,Greatly improved in the last few months. It feels like patients matter again.
Peninsula2,Had to get advice elsewhere,4/28/2022,1,"Disregarded when I was pregnant and had Covid 19 and calling for advice and guidance - told to call back another day as fully booked despite my symptoms and medication advice being needed then. I called another local surgery who put me straight in touch with a GP within the hour and gave the advice and reassurance I needed despite not even being registered with them. 

Miss pelt my name on recent bloods led to lost results re booking, then a conflicting call a few hours later to say results were back and GP recommendations were to have more tests as there were some concerns in results. Information is inaccurate and all receptionists seem to have lack of information or awareness of what the other is doing. Hopeless cant wait to go elsewhere but waiting until my babys birth as I already know it would be too much hassle to change GP surgery's mid pregnancy and Aldeburgh would inevitably make it harder than needs be."
Peninsula2,I adjusted to the change,7/4/2022,4,My experience in recent times ( during Covid)has been good and improved greatly over the last couple of years. I appreciate changes to the structure have had hiccups but people take time to adjust to anything new and I have had nothing but care and kindness from all the medical staff and admin staff.
Peninsula2,Improved,4/21/2022,3,"Changes over last 18 months have improved the attitude at the practice (some words were removed). Reception staff had been quite awkward, in the end I formally complained and had a long letter of apology from a GP."
Peninsula2,Improved,4/21/2022,4,"When Peninsula took over the practice…things seem to go a bit awry for a while(not helped by Covid, I suspect). All good now."
Peninsula2,Improved significantly,7/4/2022,4,Practice has improved significantly since the amalgamation and that’s reflected in breadth of GP availability and support staff responses
Peninsula2,Inconsistent responses,4/21/2022,3,"Sometimes long wait for telephone to be answered and inconsistent response from receptionists, some helpful others don't really want to be there."
Peninsula2,Initially difficult,4/21/2022,3,"Initial response / referral is difficult initially ,but when you’re in the system it works"
Peninsula2,Integration of services would be better,4/19/2018,3,"On a Friday, I called the surgery as I could barely move. GP called back and told me just to take my current prescribed painkillers. Saturday, I was unable to move at all out of bed and so called 999. I was told I would get a consultation call within two hours. Three hours later ambulance turned up and they stayed with me for a further one and a half hours as they called 111. No ambulance staff could prescribe. The team were great, but I felt they should be out with other more needy people. I did not know about GP+ and so wonder why on the Friday I did not get sent there, as I believe the scenario on the Saturday could have been avoided."
Peninsula2,Kind staff,4/28/2022,5,Have always found to staff to be very helpful especially during the covid restrictions and all very kind and curtious when I had to visit the surgery during that time.
Peninsula2,Layout and check-in,4/21/2022,3,"On my visit today, the layout of the waiting room had changed, the chairs were in 3 rows with a central aisle, myself and other patients commented that it felt school like and so what intimidating as opposed to the chairs arranged around the room as previously.  We all said we would have posted a comment in the box, but there was no paper or pen provided to make a comment on.

Also I preferred being able to check in on the screen, which has been taken away. This could be replaced as the hand gel is still provided so you could arrive yourself and then use the antibacterial gel, it would also save waiting for the receptionist for finish on the phone or deal with a queue."
Peninsula2,Location convenience,7/4/2022,4,"""Friendly, knowledgeable professionals"". 

The only drawback is that they can’t always provide the service I need at the location and date that I need it"""
Peninsula2,Longer for blood tests,4/13/2023,4,The staff are reasonably pleasant. Generally you get through to someone in a good time when ring in the morning. I have noticed that for myself the time span for blood tests has got longer.
Peninsula2,Longer waits,7/4/2022,4,"Sometimes a long wait to get through on the phone (recorded announcements become tedious after a while), and then a long wait for an appointment to see or speak to a GP or other clinician. Resources!"
Peninsula2,Medication,4/21/2022,2,"Medication was prescribed with no explanation or reasonable follow up. Reactions and side effects were brushed aside as ""all medication has side effects."" There was no engagement with the patient."
Peninsula2,Mis-diagnosed,4/21/2022,2,Inability to get appointments quickly and to see a Doctor face to face. Mis-diagnosis where I’ve had to go privately and pay myself.
Peninsula2,Much better now,7/4/2022,4,"The Practice had problems with providing care during the Covid pandemic-reception and appointments particularly were not always handled well -and many patients left. Now the situation is very much better and I am glad that we did not join the Aldeburgh exodus.
A small point the waiting area for patients here  might be made a bit more inviting??"
Peninsula2,Much improved,4/28/2022,5,"Peninsula Practice has got its act together and now provides an excellent all round service. From start of Covid to approximately 9 months ago the service left a lot to be desired, *some text removed as not 'hearsay'* This comment may sound hard but I believe the staff approach and the way they spoke to people was extremely poor. I nearly transferred to another surgery but glad I didn't as now I cannot fault the Practice - keep it up please."
Peninsula2,Much improved,4/21/2022,4,Was not so good when first became Peninsula practice but is now much improved.
Peninsula2,Mum ill and needed a doctor,5/24/2022,1,"Needed a doctor for my mum asap told they would come out after lunch but nothing, not even a call. In end I had to call 111 and get her to hospital as got worse"
Peninsula2,Need to be more welcoming,4/21/2022,3,"Reception staff still unhelpful .  No hello. Telephone and computer  takes priority. . When standing for attention  and 4 staff on duty  all involved with computers.    
Staff need training to be welcoming and you won’t feel a nuisance! 
Medical staff very inviting with a smile ."
Peninsula2,Needs to be timely,4/21/2022,3,Been told to ring back early the following morning is no good if you're feeling in need at other times
Peninsula2,Never open,7/12/2020,1,"I rarely take me or my child to the doctors so when I do it’s usually important. Tried to get a blood test last year but was told there was a 4 week wait and to go to Ipswich. I don’t drive so that would be a 4 hour journey total on the bus with a young child strapped in a buggy the whole time, i don’t think so. I also find the receptionist has a bad attitude and can be quite sarcastic, I think this needs to be looked into if this person is communication with vulnerable people. Really disappointed they were closed for over 3 months due to coronavirus, offering absolutely no service in Aldeburgh, their only alternative was to go to Orford surgery which theee is no public transport to get to, at this point there were no taxis about too, and people couldn’t car share. Shocking how they got away with leaving several thousand people without healthcare for months"
Peninsula2,New system,2/12/2019,5,"The new appointment system works for me, but I can drive.
When you get your call back from the GP you may be required to come in 1or 2 hours later, so many that do not drive would struggle.
I am retired and still independent so works well for me."
Peninsula2,No complaints,4/19/2018,5,I haven't needed surgery for 3 years. Now having a health check and I was contacted for this. No complaints.
Peninsula2,No follow up,4/28/2022,2,"Subsequent to submitting my previous BP results as instructed before Christmas to a rather indifferent receptionist I have heard nothing at all. My BP has been in the 160/90's at times and regularly 150/90's.
I mentioned that the doctor had advised statins well before this but again no follow-up."
Peninsula2,No problem with appointment,4/19/2018,5,Having regular blood as diabetic. Appointment in surgery is great and it's local and not too far to go.
Peninsula2,Not confident,4/21/2022,3,The Aldeburgh Surgery still doesn’t inspire confidence despite the good work of the practitioners. Some of the reception staff are unwelcoming and unhelpful.
Peninsula2,On the ball,4/28/2022,5,It’s just good to know surgery on the ball . Much appreciated
Peninsula2,Outstanding,6/16/2020,5,"I get an appointment when I need one.  Since some changes to the system it is much easier to be seen on the day than it used to be.
Just an excellent service, with lovely staff"
Peninsula2,Overall good,7/4/2022,4,My overall experience has been good but not great at times. I find trying to ring at 8am and then on hold for a long time only to be told no appointments with either a doctor or nurse practioner.
Peninsula2,Overall satisfied,7/4/2022,4,Overall my husband and I  are satisfied how the Surgery has performed under difficult circumstances.
Peninsula2,Patients being seen in a timely manner,6/7/2018,4,"Due to poor weather last week, I was surprised by how few people were in the waiting room. Patients being seen in a timely manner."
Peninsula2,Phone service appalling,2/12/2022,1,"Trying to contact via phone to enquire about my medication that has yet to be approved that was ordered a week ago .. Been number one in queue for 25 minutes, listening to awful opera music that is very annoying and making the long wait stressful"
Peninsula2,Predominantly good,4/13/2023,4,"The service is predominantly good. It can be difficult to get through on the telephone, timewise, but learnt that now is the 'norm'. With my hearing impairment, I have no issues with the callbacks, as my hearing aids have bluetooth."
Peninsula2,Prescriptions,4/21/2022,4,Very helpful staff especially on repeat prescriptions.
Peninsula2,Proactive,4/28/2022,5,"I have been a patient for around a year now having moved to the area. I was informed by locals that it wasn’t a good practice but that isn’t my experience. I have found it to be easy enough to get treatment and surprisingly proactive, I’m thinking of the long covid treatment."
Peninsula2,Professional,4/21/2022,4,Very professional and appointments suitable for myself.
Peninsula2,Reception,4/21/2022,3,"Reception needs to work on their people skills, they are rude, abrupt and unhelpful in person and on the phone.  Once you get past them the service it a different story can't fault it at all."
Peninsula2,Reception make a difference,4/28/2022,5,"It makes a big difference when the people on reception are naturally friendly/helpful, and also with phone calls when whoever answers is naturally positive and pleased to take your call/trying to help"
Peninsula2,relating to lockdown,7/4/2022,4,"I have scored practice as good but this was not the case during lock-down.  Am annoyed that it was not possible to see a doctor in person.  I fully realise that this was the position throughout the country and that doctors were in a difficult position. However, by not seeing patients in person the old and vulnerable were more isolated and the epidemic even more frightening.  

It was good that we were able to obtain vaccinations when they were available and we had our first dose in Woodbridge.  We had our booster doses in Kesgrave.  We were offered a booster in Aldeburgh but some time after we had booked in Kesgrave on-line."
Peninsula2,Repeat myself,4/21/2022,3,I'm only giving these ratings because my old doctor has left and I was never informed and feel like every time I go for an appointment I have go through everything all over again know they have records but it's how I feel
Peninsula2,Same GP,7/4/2022,4,It would be good to see the same doctor each time as we used to until the merger.
Peninsula2,Same GP wish,12/4/2023,4,"Undergoing treatment, so I do wish I was able to see the same GP as that consistency does help in this situation. 
The care however by all involved is still excellent"
Peninsula2,Satisfied,4/21/2022,4,"When I attend this practice, I feel satisfied that my concerns have been met."
Peninsula2,Satisfied with care,12/4/2018,4,"Due to poor weather last week, surprised by how few people were in the waiting room. Patients being seen in a timely manner."
Peninsula2,See many different GPs but that can be good,5/16/2019,4,"I do not know who my allocated GP is as I haven't seen them in so long. That would be my only concern, So far I have seen many different GPs and on one occasion I was diagnosed differently seeing someone different. I was prescribed a cream and on this occasion the problem cleared ip a couple of days. So seeing a different GP was beneficial on this occasion."
Peninsula2,Seen at short notice,4/13/2023,4,"I have had big concerns about my eye, and as I could not get an appointment at the opticians for 10 days so they agreed to see me today as I am worried about this. Waiting 10 days for the opticians for me was not too long. I appreciated that they got me in at such short notice as I did not ring first thing."
Peninsula2,Sent to pharmacy instead,2/12/2019,3,"My unwell mother had a call from GP & was told to go to the pharmacy. They were unable to deal with the situation so we called the hospital to get the repeat prescription needed.
As she is mentally unwell this was very unhelpful and caused unnecessary distress. She has what we call ‘blips’ and needs to be seen when having one so they can assist her appropriately."
Peninsula2,Some areas of excellence,4/21/2022,3,Clinical experiences I have had have all been excellent. The nursing staff do a fantastic job. But the practice is let down in other areas (some words were removed as not set in experience)
Peninsula2,Speaking or seeing a GP is difficult,7/26/2021,3,"I was very happy with the service provided by the Church Farm Surgery in Aldeburgh. Since the Peninsula Practice took it over, the service has been poor. Trying to speak to anyone that can help you can be difficult. I'm a really clear communicator and have a lot of patience, but I struggle to get the help I need."
Peninsula2,System good for me,2/12/2019,5,As a retired person I personally find the new appointment system works very well. I used to find accessing an appointment more difficult but things seem to have got better.
Peninsula2,Thank you,4/28/2022,5,I have had nothing but a positive experience with the Aldeburgh practice.....thank you  to all the staff.
Peninsula2,Timely help,4/28/2022,5,I have received all of the help that was needed at the time
Peninsula2,Treatment very good,4/28/2022,5,The treatment I received was very good  and also the Antibiotics  worked for me over all I am very happy now Aldeburgh  Surgery  operates
Peninsula2,Triage,4/21/2022,3,"3* because the people who answer the phone are often abrupt and it feels that they are (word removed) keeping people at arm's length. Also phone consultations work well for some issues and some people, but face to face should be offered when the patient requests this."
Peninsula2,Trying to get app for 4 wks,4/28/2022,1,Started of very poor but later improved until now it’s at it’s worst son has been trying to get an appointment for 4 weeks for a pre-existing injury. Every time he phones up he is told ring tomorrow or sometime it has been ring next week.It’s appalling.
Peninsula2,Very helpful,4/28/2022,5,I have always received very helpful and sensible advice.
Peninsula2,Wait on phone,7/4/2022,4,The wait to get through on the phone is the biggest frustration
Peninsula2,Waiting area,7/4/2022,4,"There has been a slight lack of care around Aldeburgh Surgery since the take over, the waiting room was always a tidy welcoming place, now you feel you are waiting in a store room. The staff are as friendly and helpful as always but it feels confusing when you see a different doctor every appointment."
Peninsula2,website does not work,10/17/2022,1,My wife needs COVID Flu vaccinations. Been trying to get a home visit as she is housebound. Telephoned twice since 9. Visited once without success. Fobbed-off with 'we will ring you'. Your records are also not up to date. Feels like the practice is a shambles. My wife is vulnerable according to NHS letters.
Peninsula2,With demand high we do well here,9/17/2018,5,"The system has had to have a few changes recently on how you get an appointment.  A few more hoops, lets say.
It is a sign of the increasing demand on our NHS.  I for my part only see a GP when I need to and am grateful to be able to do so."
Peninsula2,Works for clinicians but not for patients.,5/21/2021,2,"Been with practice since 2015. Nice experience. Peninsular took over and service immediately went downhill. Come Covid they hit rock bottom. Awful,  which is why so many patients moved practice to Leiston where according to my neighbour's, the care is what you expect from doctors as Aldeburgh Practice once was. I have heart issues,  my wife MS. Just a couple of examples of our experience. In lockdown 'Drive to Ipswich for kidney function blood test.' Told I was refusing treatment offer so did not get test for months. Severe groin and rectal area inflammation and bleeding.  Could not see doctor for examination, telephone appointments only and condition worsened until we eventually got to see wonderful specialist nurse from local hospital at home. What can we do, join the exodus? Currently we trust the NHS will see the light and do something to turn this practice around."
Peninsula2,Works well for me,4/28/2022,5,"I have had appointments when I needed them
The flu and covid vaccination procedures  work well
I can see my medical records on-line"
Peninsula2,Would like continuity,4/28/2022,5,I have always been satisfied with this surgery but I do feel there is no continuity with one particular doctor. All medical information is on a screen but sometimes it is background information not on the screen which is just as important.
Pinewood,3 star,9/16/2015,3,3 Star
Pinewood,3 weeks to see a dr of choice,10/20/2016,3,Not particularly easy to see a doctor of your choice.  It can take up to 3 weeks.  I arranged an appointment to see a nurse for couple of reasons and told reception but when I saw the nurse she had no idea why I was there as no information had been passed to her.  When getting results I called to be told they were normal but when I asked what that meant the receptionist said I would need to speak to the doctor.  I'v had to wait almost 2 weeks for this phone appointment.  Generally face to face care is 1st class
Pinewood,A bit rushed,8/25/2019,3,I do feel a bit rushed in the surgery. I find getting an appointment difficult. I lost a whole day recently when the care navigator sent me to the pharmacy and the pharmacist said that he wasn't a doctor and sent me to the GP.
Pinewood,Absolutely appalling,10/27/2015,1,"This was so bad I have put a formal complaint in via CAB. I had an emergency appointment due to a breakdown. 

I saw a doctor. Knowing I was on a very tight regime (appointment of only 5 mins) I asked them if they could see a general background idea of my condition on their database? (to avoid waffling on in a limited time). The Dr told me they had 24 other patients to see before 6 O'clock and that it was the same old same with me 'dead husbands', neighbours and cats etc. They sent me on a return to work programme!!! 

I am and have been in work for the past two years. I am absolutely appalled. I filed a complaint and received word BUT NO APOLOGY."
Pinewood,Always a good service,6/1/2020,5,Have had to come to Derby Road today as person at Pinewood who could do the injection had finished for the day.  We do not mind and have always received a good service.
Pinewood,Always get an appointment.,8/25/2019,4,I can always get an appointment. I have 2 small children and it's never been an issue. I always find the staff to be friendly. GP gives me time and space.
Pinewood,Always room for improvement,5/8/2015,4,If emergency can get in same day or 2-3 days
Pinewood,Can't get medication added as a repeat,1/11/2021,1,"I am really struggling to get medication prescribed by my consultant added to my repeat prescription even after asking multiple time. I start hospital treatment soon and really want this sorted by then. I can't understand why they can not just do what they need to do, it is so frustrating."
Pinewood,Car park a bit small.,8/25/2019,5,I have noticed a significant improvement over recent years. Car park is a bit small. Some of the doctors give a bit more clarity regarding my condition.
Pinewood,Cooperative.,8/25/2019,5,Always helpful here and we are able to get an appointment as needed. I have always found the staff to be helpful and friendly and cooperative. Car park is a bit small.
Pinewood,Difficult to get an appointment with a specific doctor,6/18/2018,1,It is so difficult to get an appointment with a specific doctor - told there was a five week wait but that it was too early to book an appointment with said doctor?
Pinewood,Doctors are fine,9/21/2018,3,"Appointments are very difficult to get. When I am ill and do get one, the doctors are fine. I have to say that I don’t ever seem to get to see the same doctor twice."
Pinewood,don't allow a full discussion,7/10/2016,4,10 minute appointment times do not allow a full discussion
Pinewood,Don't like triage system.,12/14/2017,3,Don't like the triage system. I'd prefer to get an appointment more easily. Getting appointments is difficult and takes ime
Pinewood,Excellent,3/16/2016,5,"Had to wait about 10 days for appointment.
Can't get cholesterol check even at annual checkup.  I have high BP but won't check cholestol as I'm on medication.  Not good enough."
Pinewood,Excellent - Drs. are 5 star,7/10/2016,5,"Doctors are five star for attitude, it is reception staff (some of them) who are 2 star!"
Pinewood,Fantastic response,2/4/2019,5,"The reception staff were so helpful when I needed some medication for a migraine, they could not be more helpful. I also had a follow gp appointment with the doctor today who was so patient focussed and he really listened and was responsive. I really feel this is it I’ve experience was worth sharing. Thank you."
Pinewood,Friendly staff,8/25/2019,5,"Wish more appointments were available. Friendly staff on the whole. I was diagnosed with a condition in 2016 and just sent on my way with a leaflet, which felt a bit impersonal."
Pinewood,Friendly staff and very helpful,10/13/2021,5,Recently returned to Pinewood Surgery after moving into the area again. Staff were very helpful and so far have provided excellent service regarding vaccinations and setting up of patient online accounts
Pinewood,good efficient service,7/15/2016,4,"I cannot get  blood tests done at the surgery.  Instead I have to go to the hospital.  It is easy to make emergency appointments by phone.  I phone and ask to see a GP.  A GP then phones back to decide whether I do need to see a GP.  If I do, I then get an appointment.  The last time the GP diagnosed over the phone.  He told me to bring a urine sample to the surgery.  I did not see the GP but got a phonecall later that day to say I had a urine infection & to come and collect a prescription"
Pinewood,Good experience,8/25/2019,3,Today was a good experience and I noticed an improvement with the front desk attitude. Overall I have noticed a general improvement with this surgery.
Pinewood,Good overall,11/25/2016,5,They use a triage system to decide if you need to be seen by anyone and the new building is easily accessible. I did have to chase my blood test results and the 10 minute appointments aren't really long enough and more time would enable more in depth discussions.
Pinewood,Good surgery,9/13/2022,5,"A good surgery and the online system is great as you don't have to call and they come back to you quickly. I had a call back and then an appointment the same day I submitted the request. We're up there regularly with the children and it works well, we've had no issues getting them appointments either."
Pinewood,Great doctors,9/29/2016,4,"Great doctors, but not much time to discuss."
Pinewood,Great once you get in,6/20/2017,3,Great once you get to see the nurse - reception very  hesitant to book you an appointment.
Pinewood,Great surgery,7/10/2016,5,I just can't believe how much better Pinewood is than my previous surgery-great!!
Pinewood,Helpful,8/25/2019,4,I like to preplan my appointments and they do this for me at the surgery face to face at the last visit. I've been here 15 years and always found the staff helpful. I tend to wait about 15 minutes.
Pinewood,Hospital appointments at different times from referrals,11/25/2016,4,"It would be better if all referrals to the hospital were done at same time to investigate a problem. I have been referred for one scan or xray after the other. It would be better if they were done at the same time, its almost like the doctor is going down a tick list but this means extra visits to the hospital all the time."
Pinewood,I find it challenging to get blood test,8/25/2019,4,"I find it challenging to get a blood test at this surgery. I do feel I get a bit more priority with appointments because I have heart failure. Repeat prescriptions can be given in dribs and drabs, I wish they could be given at the same time."
Pinewood,I'm very happy with the surgery,7/10/2015,4,I'm very happy with the surgery and the nursing staff are great.
Pinewood,Long wait,8/25/2019,3,Long waiting times. Lack of appointments available - 2 week wait. Staff don't explain a lot on conditions.
Pinewood,Long wait to see specific doctor,7/10/2016,4,It can take up to three weeks if I want to see a specific doctor. This is too long
Pinewood,Meant to have 6 month review,6/10/2015,4,Been on antidepressants for a year nearly was meant to have 6 month review seen DR for other things and has not spoke about it.
Pinewood,Mental health related poor communication,10/12/2017,2,"If it's an emergency they will always fit you in. Due to having mental health issues in the past I feel that anything I raise is put down to that. They can't always find everything on the computer system, with scans and results for example. It's also not great if they don't listen to you and take concerns seriously."
Pinewood,Never see the same GP,7/10/2016,4,This is a good practice but I never see the same GP so there is no continuity of care which is a shame.
Pinewood,New patient- good so far,5/13/2016,5,We've just moved to the surgery but everything has been great so far. I've had one telephone consultation and this has worked well to get new medication.
Pinewood,No review - Only ratings provided,7/16/2015,3,No review - Only ratings provided
Pinewood,No review - Only ratings provided,7/16/2015,5,No review - Only ratings provided
Pinewood,"Overall, very good",7/10/2016,5,Overall the service is very good but I would like to get an appointment a bit quicker
Pinewood,Poor - Telephone triage,7/10/2016,4,I don't like the telephone triage (call back) system because I have missed calls and had to wait days for an appointment
Pinewood,Poor - unable to get through on the 'phone for an appointment.,1/8/2017,2,Getting an appointment.  Not being able to get through on the phone.
Pinewood,Pretty good place,1/9/2017,4,"This is a pretty good place, I have been going there for some years and I have always been happy with the service I have received."
Pinewood,Recent improvement,8/4/2016,3,"More recently the service has improved. When my child is unwell staff know us well enough now to know that she needs to be seen quickly, when she was younger they weren't quite so good."
Pinewood,Service ok - but I sometimes have to prompt and ask questions,7/10/2016,4,Sometimes I get told what the problem is (that I have attended for) but sometimes I am just given medication and sent away. I have to prompt and ask questions
Pinewood,"So disappointed, let down and failed",4/25/2023,1,"I'm type 2 diabetic and was issued a libre on prescription then it was removed. I was told if I need it I will have to pay for it. Proved it works for me, proved my weight and number come down while using. 
Also admitted to hospital after being given wrong antibiotics for pneumonia I was told I had been failed by my doctor. Been with Derby road/pinewood for 12 years and I've never felt so alone and unhelped. Was told money was the issue, I asked if its right to put a price on life to which I was told there is nothing they can do."
Pinewood,Staff friendly,8/25/2019,4,"I have come for a review of my tablets, but I don't come often. One of the receptionists can be rude to my partner, but I have found staff to be friendly."
Pinewood,Straight in,2/22/2022,5,I registered and used AskMyGP today (launch day) and within 30 minutes I am in the surgery.  Really easy to use and responsive.
Pinewood,Very good,8/25/2019,4,Always able to get an appointment. I have some prescription concerns and I feel rushed when I am in the surgery. On the whole very good.
Pinewood,Very good - I've only been registered a shortish time,7/10/2016,5,I have only been registered here a shortish time but they are very good. Even better than my previous surgery and I thought they were good!
Pinewood,Very good - looked after very well,7/10/2016,5,I don't come here often but when I do they look after me very well.
Pinewood,Very good except delay in waiting room,7/10/2016,5,very good other than I sometimes have towait in the waiting room for 20 after my appointment time.
Pinewood,Very happy,8/25/2019,4,"Quite new to surgery. Every time no issues with appointments. very happy with GP, would not change a thing."
Pinewood,Very please  - I recently transferred here,7/10/2016,5,I recently transferred here fro Two Rivers surgery and they are at least as good and maybe better! I'm very pleased.
Ravenwoods,100% improvement,12/17/2021,5,"Seen by a GP within 3hrs, Dr was very thorough, went through my problems and took the necessary actions he considered necessary. So nice to have a face to face consultation. The young lady who took bloods and did the ECG was lovely. 100% improvement over a few months ago"
Ravenwoods,45min wait on phone!,12/14/2021,1,"Poor communications and service, should never have been allowed to merge or take on new patients until all staff and systems in place, my 89 yr old friend has gone down hill badly due to the inability to see face to face a GP she has waited in for phone calls which do not happen and suggesting she goes on line etc etc does not cut the ice."
Ravenwoods,54 mins unable to get sick child appointment,9/21/2022,1,"I Spent 52 minutes on hold waiting for the phone to be answered.  To be told that I couldn't make an appointment for my sick child - a ""care navigator""  would call me back!

Completely unacceptable!"
Ravenwoods,6 canceled appointments,3/30/2022,1,Waiting over 6 mths and 6 canceled appointments for a review they asked 4
Ravenwoods,A very long wait for appointment,5/10/2021,2,It took me three weeks to speak to a doctor and wasnt allowed to see the one requested instead was contacted by a Clinical practitioner and given a face to face 20min appointment 2 weeks later. I was told I could only speak about two things during that appointment and had to have another one two weeks later to deal with the other. Thats 7 weeks and no further forward. I feel the practice is pushing everyone towards 111 or A & E Is not right.
Ravenwoods,A&E as could not get seen,10/5/2022,1,My arm was infected after a tattoo issue. Could not get to see anyone and had to go to A&E which resulted in being given drugs to sort. It is ridiculous. Has taken 3 months to get a blood test. They were prescribing me without seeing me.
Ravenwoods,About advanced practice nurse,7/22/2022,5,Have had a ongoing knee infection prob for months which has now been sorted thanks to the care and understanding I received. The practice nurse listened and did a fantastic job for me. Thanks again.
Ravenwoods,Access issues with AskMyGP,6/2/2023,1,"Is anyone concerned that, nearly every day for the past few weeks, AskMyGP appears to be open at 8am (or sometimes later than this) and then Cardinal Medical Practice deliberately shutdown access - sometimes as early as 10am, with the words: ""AskMyGP is currently unavailable due to the unprecedented demand for our services... all of our appointment slots are fully booked ... our phone lines will remain operational as we are still dealing with urgent requests"". 

Whilst occasional high demand is not unreasonable, demand cannot be unprecedented every day for weeks on end! What sort of service is this for residents of North-West Ipswich? I've no doubt that all GP practices are stretched at the moment, but I don't see other GP practices across Suffolk using this technique.

What action is Suffolk Healthwatch taking over this?

Does Cardinal Medical Practice not have any sort of contractual obligation to the SNEE ICB to provide access to GP services (including non-urgent appointments!) between 8:30 and 6:30 every working day?

If all non-urgent appointment slots are booked in the first couple of hours every day, that can only mean that Cardinal Medical Practice is simply not employing enough clinical staff (locums if necessary!) to deal with patient demand.

I seem to remember that Dan Poulter reported Cardinal Medical Practice to CQC back in 9 2021 for failure of the practice to provide sufficient numbers of care navigators to answer their telephone lines. Supposedly after meetings with the local CCG he was, according to the EADT, assured that the situation was improving, that new staff had been recruited and that a new internet-based solution for accessing GP services was being deployed (that would solve all these problems!) - although it has to be said that a significant proportion of patients may struggle with internet-based access to services. Now that this online solution for accessing clinical help has been rolled-out, it would appear that Cardinal Medical Practice is doing it again - it is again deliberately making it difficult for the public to gain access to GP services. This action by the GP partners at Cardinal (remember they have already been caught-out and reported to CQC and are currently marked ""requires improvement"") is utterly shocking. Is their action bringing the profession into disrepute? Having already been shown the ""yellow"" card by CQC, is it time for the ""red"" card to come out? What is the MP doing about it now? And, with hindsight, was the MP fobbed off by the local CCG last time round?"
Ravenwoods,After 1 hour free I get charged,5/18/2022,1,"My landline is that I get the first hour free then get charged. I ring into the surgery, wait and wait then you get down to 10 in the queue, but my hour of waiting is now up, what do I do? Hang up a restart or pay? Last time I stayed on it cost me £9. I cannot afford to do that every time I need medical assistance. I do not use the computer so telephone is my only option"
Ravenwoods,All done online with Ask My GP,6/17/2022,1,"They prefer to do most of their work on the phone and waiting to get through has been very costly for me, the last time I tried to get through to them it cost me nearly £10 on my phone. I've been in pain for 5 months and have had 4 phone appointments and then I insisted on a face to face appointment. Amazingly I was then sent off for scans and to the heart centre, if I'd been seen earlier I would've had this earlier.  I also can't understand how for asthma reviews these can be done over the phone.  The phone calls have just delayed me being properly diagnosed and being referred to hospital"
Ravenwoods,always hard to get an appointment,3/11/2021,1,its so hard to get an appointment and new facilities people are rude. my doctors surgery was in my area but when i do get an appointment im sent all around ipswich its ridiculous.
Ravenwoods,App is good for me,5/17/2022,4,"Being 30th in the telephone queue, I decided to try the App. I have always had a response the same or next day, so for me it has been brilliant. One was an email as I only needed some information and the other 2 were phone calls that did not need a face to face appointment."
Ravenwoods,Appalling,11/17/2021,1,The phone queue is ridiculous. I had a blood test at the beginning of October and have heard nothing about the results.. this was never the case before the merger. I can’t even call up for the results because of the 1hr waiting time. It’s an absolute joke. I can’t go online or use a computer during the day as I work on construction sites. How would you suggest I receive my results?
Ravenwoods,Appalling,11/15/2021,1,The phone queue is ridiculous. I had a blood test at the beginning of October and have heard nothing about the results.. this was never the case before the merger. I can’t even call up for the results because of the 1hr waiting time. It’s an absolute joke. I can’t go online or use a computer during the day as I work on construction sites. How would you suggest I receive my results?
Ravenwoods,Ask my gp,1/2/2022,5,"Really impressed- within a few hours I had a phone call from one of the GP’s who asked me to come down to see her straight away. A very kind, knowledgeable and efficient lady who examined me and then completed a referral to the hospital."
Ravenwoods,Ask my GP is not responding,10/5/2022,1,"I receive a text to contact the gp in respect to a letter they have received….. nearly 48 hours later from contacting the gp online, I have no response 
Tried calling ….. no.16 in the queue 
And I’m the one being told to contact them"
Ravenwoods,Ask my gp takes two weeks for a return call,9/17/2022,1,"As a diabetic, I feel I’m not getting the service that I should be getting and as a working woman too never able to sort anything out. It takes around two weeks for a return response."
Ravenwoods,Askmygp doesn’t get a response,4/28/2022,1,I was contacted by text and asked to make contact through askmygp about an urgent issue. Three days later I’m still waiting for a response.
Ravenwoods,AskMyGP is GREAT,1/2/2022,5,"It was impossible to get seen or have any appointment before they were available at AskMyGP, but now it flows so fast and easy, send in a question and have a reply back in a few hours. This is such a massive step up from being so far back in phone queue that you just got cut off. Very very happy with this new service, and also with how fast the prescriptions are sent out when ordered through NHS app."
Ravenwoods,askMyGP is not intuitive for booking an appt.,11/3/2022,3,"The Chesterfield Drive surgery has always been great, this feedback only relates to the askMyGP service. I was sent a letter asking me to use the askMyGP service to book my annual asthma review - my request was treated as though I was raising a new medical complaint and I was asked irrelevant questions. The service should have an option to key in a reference value (which should be provided on the letter) and it would then understand that the request is to book an appointment as requested."
Ravenwoods,Avoid,12/14/2021,1,Takes almost up too 1 hour to answer then fobs you off and tells you to go on the ask my GP website instead. Receptionists are rude and don’t even know what planet they are on half the time. Nurses are even worse
Ravenwoods,Awful,5/22/2023,2,"Whilst there are some lovely staff there, since the surgery became Cardinal Medical Practice,  it's terrible.  I know they'll trying their best, when nurses give out the wrong info,  patients given medication that they shouldn't,  blood tests go missing and have to be retaken. Too many people and not enough suitable staff."
Ravenwoods,Awful,11/12/2021,1,"Up to a two hour wait to speak to rude receptionists, who then ask you to use the Askmygp service. We don’t all have time to jump through hoops & wait days on end. I suffer with mental health & will not use these services again, was made to feel a nuisance for wanting to see my own gp not a locum."
Ravenwoods,Awful - takes ages to get through on phone,1/12/2021,1,"Since there merged can never get though!!! Number 20 in the queue thought not bad, I was in the 30's last time I'll wait, it took from 3pm till 4-50pm to get though , ridiculous !!!!"
Ravenwoods,Awful now,10/27/2021,1,"Before the merge, Chesterfield drive were fantastic. Now you can't get through on the phone, you can't get answers to complaints via email or letter from *name removed* at the practice. Don't join if you want to be looked after."
Ravenwoods,Awful service here,3/31/2022,1,"I had a text message to book an appointment with a Dr to discuss my latest test results in last week February I tried to book next day on ask my GP they weren’t taking bookings. Rang waited 35 mins until finally answered by someone having a conversation with a colleague they then hung up on me. Back in  telephone queue 25mins later managed to speak to some. I explained about the text request and also asked if I could speak to a Dr about palpitations and high blood pressure at night. Receptionist said she’d book a double appointment with a Dr. 
Had phone call next day from Dr and they asked me to come to surgery. I attended discussed blood pressure problems and heart rhyth, they asked me to book blood test and 24hr heart monitor. I asked about discussing my scan results they said the heart problem was too complicated they can’t discuss it now I will have to make another appointment. I went home and tried to book the blood test and heart monitor.Earliest blood test 3 weeks away (booked), 24hr monitor earliest appointment 16th6!booked
2 weeks ago I had a text from another Dr who Ive never seen saying they’d issued a prescription for the condition I was supposed to see a dr about to discuss.  On Tuesday 29th March I had a text from Cardinal medical Practice stating that ‘due to unforeseen circumstances we have had to cancel your appointment for heart monitor on 16th 6. No apology no other booking offered. I have been taking my blood pressure at home for the last five weeks and went on Ask my GP on Tuesday29th March booking a call from Dr to discuss this. No acknowledgement and no call to date 31st March 6pm. The place is a mess. This is disgraceful and stressful. I feel that Suffolk Primary Care are forgetting about caring for their patients completely."
Ravenwoods,"Awful, unable to get appointments",11/15/2021,1,Disgusted. Try to get through and get cut off. People who actually work cant speak to anyone or get an appointment.
Ravenwoods,Baby Immunizations,2/12/2021,1,"My baby was refused immunization because I was 18 minute late.
And I think this is not fair enough considering the fact that anything can happen unexpectedly with a baby."
Ravenwoods,Been ringing for days for an appointment,10/13/2021,1,"On being put on hold for a ""care navigator"", receptionist I assume, the lowest I have been on the waiting phone line is 31, I don't have the time to sit on hold for goodness knows how long."
Ravenwoods,Been waiting since Wednesday for a call back,5/21/2022,1,"Not had even a phone call. I am in agony with my back and can hardly walk, also tried ask my gp no reply either, so had to stay in bed all day Monday."
Ravenwoods,Blood test delays,6/16/2023,2,"The hospital ordered bloods for me on discharge to have at the surgery. Was expecting to be contacted by them. 6 weeks later I have still heard nothing, so I rang in, only to be told to go online and book at Landseer road. They had nothing for 3 weeks so rang surgery back, only to be offered something on the Monday. Surely they could have done that in the first place without me being given the runaround!"
Ravenwoods,Brilliant system,11/18/2021,5,"Much easier to use AskMyGP system. I used to have to wait in the queue on the telephone and it was frustrating. Now, within an hour everything was sorted and I came into Chesterfield drive surgery for an appointment."
Ravenwoods,Called back within 2hrs - exceptional service,2/2/2022,5,"Spoke to nurse and seen within another hr ,exceptional service"
Ravenwoods,Can not get through on the phone,12/12/2021,1,Have to wait an hour to get through  and when you do they are not helpful and just try to push you through to an online portal. Hopeless for a 90 year old lady
Ravenwoods,Can’t be bothered,4/17/2022,1,"My wife leaves requests and no one comes back.  Very poor GP Practice.  If it were a commercial business, it would be bankrupt :("
Ravenwoods,Can’t book appt on phone only via AskMyGP,4/14/2022,1,"Terrible. Why can’t you book a Drs appt online or on the phone. Have to register with AskMyGP then fill out form. This is bad enough but you can only do this during opening hours. Why?

How are old people meant to understand how to do this?

People do not understand. It is no wonder A&E is so busy people would rather go direct there than have to fill out forms and wait for someone to call you back. 

This needs to be sorted urgently. It does not work."
Ravenwoods,Can’t get hold of anyone,9/20/2022,1,Told to register for ask my GP - but there is no registration link only Log In! And there is no ask my GP app either.
Ravenwoods,Can’t get my Future appointments,4/4/2022,1,Make it a bit easier for us old ones
Ravenwoods,Can’t see a doctor or get through by phone,11/17/2021,1,Been trying to see a doctor for months. Been on new system not heard back at all. Tells me I need to see doctor queue so long on phone. When do get through they say no appointments phone back next week. A joke.
Ravenwoods,Can’t work out how to book an appointment,12/15/2021,1,I have to ring the practice. How complicated can you make it to book an appointment?. It’s ridiculous
Ravenwoods,Cannot book routine appointment,10/5/2023,1,I received a text message telling me to book my annual hypertension review via AskMyGp. I went online to be told the site was closed!? How can a website be closed!? It said they would contact me via text or phone call! What is the point of having a website if you have to wait for a phone call - which will probably be made while I am working and can’t answer. I thought the whole idea was to avoid having to use the phone altogether. Not impressed.
Ravenwoods,Cannot contact & book appointment,10/11/2021,1,"I work office hours Monday to Friday and with the time I need to commute to work I cannot contact my GP within the restricted opening hours. The waiting time over the phone is over an hour, and online consultation can’t provide me with any help.
I’m unwell and left stuck with no options to be looked after."
Ravenwoods,Cannot fault,9/27/2022,5,"Informed me I needed an appointment, they rang at 9 for 10.15 at chesterfield drive. Doctor was brilliant. Very informative explained a lot of things"
Ravenwoods,Cannot phone to get app,9/11/2021,1,My 73 year old father is having breathing difficulties Spent over an hour in a queue on the phone (24th in queue ) only to be told cannot have a appointment to see a doctor and must either see pharmacist 1st or ring 111 after 18.30 . Why have a doctors surgery that seems to refuse to see patient and try’s to palm them off to someone else
Ravenwoods,Can't get through,2/10/2021,1,"Many times I have been on hold for more than 30 minutes  waiting to get through to reception,  only to be told my daughter has to wait 4 weeks for a telephone  appointment!! People who actually  work are not able to wait over half an hour to make an appointment."
Ravenwoods,Changing doctors as we speak.,9/20/2022,1,"I've used the ask my gp app at 1.20pm this afternoon with no reply, i believe this to be an important matter, I've also come to find out the app services are now closed."
Ravenwoods,Cost me £13,5/18/2022,1,"I had my phone bill and the call to this place, that I received nothing from as I got cut off, was £13! Not everyone has free calls during the day as they cannot afford it, but now I cannot afford to access a service that I am supposed to have for free. It is worrying when my health is not great now."
Ravenwoods,Couldn’t find my veins for blood test,7/8/2022,1,"Went to Norwich road for blood test after a distressing build up to it. They attempted to get blood but couldn’t find my veins, now have to wait 2weeks for another one at Landseer Road."
Ravenwoods,Delays in getting checks,6/16/2023,3,"Had major delays in getting checks for diabetes as no ongoing appointments are made and can't get through on the phone when AskMyGP is shutdown.
Nurses say they can't make your next appointment for the check and you have to phone on the day. But you can't always get through and things just slide. I am not 2 months on from when I should have been checked."
Ravenwoods,Diabolical!,11/15/2021,1,"Called and was number 47 in queue, got cut off after waiting half an hour at number 27. Called again, number 48, got cut off again at number 21. 
Tried E Consult, said I'd get a call back by 6:30pm the NEXT day.
I have asthma which needs treatment because I'm unwell and can't get medical help from my GP.
I have no option now but to ring 111 who will automatically send me to the hospital because it's asthma, when it could easily be treated by a GP!"
Ravenwoods,Didn’t receive call,4/4/2022,1,I suffer with anxiety and I’m waiting to speak about some results. I should have got a call today 4.03.2022. But nothing I also tried calling the doctors and kept getting cut off
Ravenwoods,Disappointed,6/30/2022,1,Was assured by 2 doctors i could collect a sick note today. Rung to see if ready was greeted by not very helpful & rude person who said it wasnt done. Was put onto list. I needed to have this to my boss today as i did stress.
Ravenwoods,Dreadful,8/4/2022,1,"Waited all day for call back surgery phoned me 2 days ago with blood test result for my 86year old mum said she had to be seen friday but couldnt book me an apt. Couldnt get one on ask my gp so phoned at 8 15 friday morning i have taken a day off work was told doc who said mum had to be seen was off sick they couldnt book mum in gad to wait for a doc call back 9 hours later still no call back i am now 14th in call queue mum wont be seen today.  Weekend tomirow im not off now till next Friday which is good Friday!!! Mum cant get there herself and gp insisted it needs a face to face apt!!!????#$#$%#$^ mum has tested as b12 deficient which is causing her a number of issues, so when is she likely to get the help she needs??? Plus ive lost a days work and she wasnt even seen let alone received a call back!!!"
Ravenwoods,Easy to use,4/2/2022,4,Easy to use and problems sorted within the same day and most of the time you get the person you request. The only issue is sometimes they close down the query without allowing you chance to message back.
Ravenwoods,Either in a queue or,10/25/2021,1,"Every time I call, I am approx number 28 in the queue and have to hold on for between 40 mins to an hour. However, today I have been trying to get through since 2.30pm and it is now 5.30pm.  Each time I have to listen to a long pre recorded message to then be told ""no lines available"" this is for 3 hours!!!  I cannot see that this is acceptable.  I understand that there is staff shortages but something needs to be rectified here.  I never had a problem getting through to my surgery before the merger."
Ravenwoods,Excellent experience using 'Askmygp' today,4/1/2022,5,Fast response to my message and good advice given. Great system for patients like me who have a hearing loss.
Ravenwoods,Extremely long wait times for everything!,11/15/2021,1,"Every time you call you are in a long queue of over 40! When you do eventually get through you don’t get to see a doctor.
Needed a medical questionnaire completed and had to wait a 3 weeks just for a signature and they charge approximately £40 for the pleasure. Even when I visited the surgery to see if it had been completed it was upgraded to urgent and still wasn’t done urgently so had to chase even further. When it was eventually completed I had to go to a totally different surgery to the one I have been registered with which is local to where I live which is why I’m registered there. The only positive I can say about this surgery is that when you do eventually speak to a member of staff they are helpful and try there best to help you, unfortunately this doesn’t out weight the many negatives."
Ravenwoods,Failed myself and son in the space of a week,7/1/2022,1,Refused to see my three week baby so ended up phoning 111 and spending the night in hospital. Not informed by anyone about having an infection 10 days post section! Left it for another week as was in agony to be told I should had been informed a week previous ! Lack of patient care!
Ravenwoods,Fantastic service,3/25/2022,5,"Fantastic service, app easy to use, fast, response very helpful."
Ravenwoods,Filter calls better,9/28/2022,3,"It is very frustrating that whatever your need is, you have to wait for ages on the telephone. If you cannot make an appointment for midwife, for example I feel a system needs to be in place that filters you off for a quick call. Another example is to call for blood test results. Even when you call later on, for results, the wait is just ridiculously long."
Ravenwoods,First class service,3/10/2021,5,I would like to thank all the staff for a excellent service through out the last eighteen months. I have always received fantastic help with any problem during the 12 years i have been at this practise. Please keep up the excellent service. The excellent service as carried on during the change over and i can say i have not had any problems
Ravenwoods,From excellent to appalling,11/15/2021,2,"As a long term patient at the practice, there was a time when I couldn’t fault them, my GP was an incredible person who’s compassion and understanding exceeded anything. They arranged my diagnosis for autism and I felt validated. Last year, and up until now, my mental health has deteriorated, my physical health is now getting worse. I understand in the current climate the restrictions regarding covid, but the shuttered door at the front has led me to feel that I can’t contact the surgery."
Ravenwoods,Gone downhill fast over last year,12/18/2021,1,"Cannot get in contact with anyone unless you wait over 3 hours on hold, went for blood tests, they called several times to say I have a message at reception but I could not answer phone at the time, tried calling back and was 64th in que, went into reception and was told they had sent letter but wouldn't say what results were, still waiting for letter over a week later."
Ravenwoods,Good but a few small issues,11/10/2021,4,"Very good once you get through on the phone, which can take some time and you can be well down the list when you join the queue. There does appear to be some confusion between the practice and the chemist as we regularly experience issues. We've been told something isn't available only for large amounts to suddenly be given to us. We've also been sent a number of video appointment letters but the letters don't actually say what the appointments are for, so we'll just have to turn up and see what it's all about."
Ravenwoods,Great improvement over last few months,1/31/2022,5,"Since AskMyGP has been implemented, the service has improved exeptionally. Fast, efficient, caring staff. Great service."
Ravenwoods,Great online system,11/18/2021,5,We used AskMyGP on Tuesday but as it was a bit late we got a call the next working day. Today we used it and got a call in 30 minutes. This is such a good system and much better than it used to be before we used it.
Ravenwoods,Have contacted Ask my g.p a few times,1/31/2022,5,"I've made 3 ask my g.p requests since Thursday, each time I've been responded to by a telephone conversation.  I like this system better than before."
Ravenwoods,Have only seen locums for last few years.,10/18/2021,1,"I have a long term condition but haven’t seen a GP since last March 2020, who was a locum. Telephoned surgery last week and was 45th in queue. I emailed in the end. Am waiting for an appointment to see a GP who is likely to be at surgery for a number of years. I’ve been told it will be sometime in November. Most people are helpful but unable to do anything. Not useful when you have a progressive illness and feel cut adrift."
Ravenwoods,Having received a letter from Cardinal Medical practice,3/12/2021,1,"The letter asked me to make an appointment for a long overdue checkup I rung through given number was 55mins in a queue only to get to be first and the young lady said she couldn't hear me she would call me back.......I'm still waiting. 
I went to Deben Rd surgery to be told we don't make appointments here it's done on line,!!!!!!!!! Or phone up!!!!!."
Ravenwoods,Home visit,5/21/2022,5,"After spinal surgery I was discharged home from hospital on 25th April. Reading my discharge papers raised a lot of unanswered questions. As I was housebound my family and I decided I needed a home visit by a GP. 
My step daughter phoned the surgery about 9 am on 3rd May. It was a long time before her call was answered by a very helpful care navigator. She asked for a doctor to visit me at home. Later that morning Dr phoned me and she visited me about 1pm. 
Dr addressed all my concerns, referring me for a blood test, referring me privately to my consultant, sorting out my medication etc.  
This time I couldn’t have asked for more.  A timely home visit from a very pleasant really helpful GP."
Ravenwoods,"I am 72 and expected to be computer savvy,",9/12/2021,1,"I have cateracts that affect my sight I phoned and spoke to someone and she told me to go onto website, it wont let me log in, all I want to do is order my repeat prescription"
Ravenwoods,I cannot contact mt GP,5/5/2022,2,"Their website 'Ask my GP' is down and everytime I try to call, I'm on hold for up to an hour only for the call to end before getting through. It's currently impossible to contact them! I have now had to make an appointment via 111 and put more pressure on the already stretched 111 service."
Ravenwoods,I have high blood pressure,7/12/2021,1,Getting hold of a doctor or someone to speak to here is nearly impossible ..No. 35 in queue for 20 minutes its an absolute disgrace
Ravenwoods,I was over 30 in the call list,11/18/2021,1,"It took me an hour and a half and £12 on my phone bill!!!!
I hope the elderly are keeping a close eye on their phone bills"
Ravenwoods,"If ill later in day, difficult",6/16/2023,3,"When using AskMyGP, if you use it in the morning, usually all is ok. If you feel ill later in the day, forget it! It was off from 9:30am recently, saying the system is at capacity. Clearly issues."
Ravenwoods,Ignored,11/29/2021,1,Totally ignored request to speak to a doctor
Ravenwoods,Ignoring high blood pressure,8/10/2022,1,I submitted my blood pressure readings over 7days following an annual review where my bp was too high. It took almost 2 months for me to get a response saying my bp meds to be adjusted when it should have been done straight away. Why so long leaving me with dangerously high blood pressure
Ravenwoods,"im not computer literate, its stressful",4/13/2022,3,this seems to be the only way to contact any one. i have had some success in getting an appointment but only after going on here on 3 days when I'm not working only to be called back the following day when i am working and there is no signal. i move around the site all day so calling on a land line is also impractical. I'm on here again today to try to speak to someone about a new prescription update. i done this friday and they called me saturday.
Ravenwoods,Impossible phone experience,10/27/2021,1,I have been trying to manage healthcare for my elderly relative - always at least 40 minutes on the phone waiting to get through if I can get through at all. Locums appear not to read medical notes before consulting about a patient. Very poor care
Ravenwoods,In phone queue 1 hour,11/29/2021,1,"Its rubbish what's going on, I'm not happy with this, I rang up  just after 8.30am I was number 50 in the queue so far I have been waiting 1 hour to talk to reception stop blaming covid it's disappointing."
Ravenwoods,Incorrect prescription issue,5/12/2021,1,It took 4 days to sort out the incorrect issue of a prescription for antibiotics meanwhile the patient was not getting any better.
Ravenwoods,It’s ridiculous the phone wait times,11/15/2021,1,I work on a construction site. I can’t use your ‘ask my gp’ or your ‘e-whatever’ as I have no computer or Wi-Fi access during the day. I have no doubt you will completely ignore this feedback & push on with this ridiculous system. I’m sure many old folk have no idea how to use/access this system. I will be looking for a new practice for myself and my family.
Ravenwoods,It's always closed by time I need to use it.,5/25/2023,1,"The ask my gp system is closed early, if you need to then phone it takes hours to get through, then some of the care navigators have a real attitude and don't accurately pass over the concerns."
Ravenwoods,Just awful. Number 40 in a telephone que!,8/11/2021,1,It's extremely difficult to get an appointment here. When you call and you're number 40 in the line be prepared to wait up to 2 hours before someone answers you.  I've also waited up to an hour only to be cut off when someone finally picked the call up
Ravenwoods,Just not getting answers,5/19/2023,1,"Ongoing cancer treatment and had a paramedic come out to look at my concerns but they then had to ring a GP. I didn't say I needed a home visit and would have been happy to come in and see a GP. Was told to go online and book blood tests, but the wait was very long so surgery did book them internally. A month later, heard nothing! In today for my partners blood test so I asked at reception about my own results. It was said that one states 'abnormal' yet I have heard nothing! I have asked for an appointment about this and was told I have to go on AskMyGP, it is so frustrating!"
Ravenwoods,Just wanted to speak to a real person,12/17/2021,1,"Poor listening to irrelevant words then cut off, Just wanted to speak to a real person after hospital operation re new medication."
Ravenwoods,Keep getting repeat meds,5/18/2022,1,"No one has seen my husband, they just keep issuing the same cream which I know long term can damage your skin (steroid cream). He needs to be seen face to face or just referred to skin specialist. It is getting ridiculous as it is getting worse not better."
Ravenwoods,Lack of service,12/10/2021,1,Not happy with the service or the lack of service. I’ve tried four times today just to find out about my blood results anc X-ray results. I be put in a queue of over 40 people . This is unexpectedly to say the least . There should be another extension for results. Also I am running out of naproxen and requested from pharmacy to 2 . With my normal tablets foo ok r it to be taken off by the . GP it need sorting before it’s to late
Ravenwoods,Level of service provided,2/17/2022,5,"I have never had a cause to question the level of service I have received since this practise was put together. Yes there was a few teething problems at first but once these were sorted out everything is fine. I have had no issues with the help I have received from doctors,nurses and  all the other staff. The main problem I think is people do not like change and are not prepared to wait for the changes to take place. The fact that these changes came at the same time as the pandemic probably did not help. All I can say based on my dealings is keep up the good work."
Ravenwoods,"Long wait, very rude GP",9/12/2021,1,"I called on behalf of a Customer and had to wait over an hour to speak to someone. When I finally got a call back the Doctor was incredibly rude, impatient and I will be logging a formal complaint. If that's how they speak to others working in the healthcare professionals, I dread to think how the customers get spoken to. If I was an elderly person I wouldn't bother trying to book an appointment as I'd be put off by the wait times and attitude of the ""professionals"". The lady I spoke to on reception was lovely, a shame the Doctor has let them down."
Ravenwoods,Lost my test results - very poor,1/12/2021,1,"I tried multiple times to get support from the surgery and I was told it didn't require a face to face appointment and no alternative support was offered. I then ended up admitted to hospital for 2 weeks. Following  discharge no contact at all.

More recently I reported problems with my cervix. I was asked to have swabs and told a date when they should be back. Heard nothing and after a week I used myGP to get an update (in hope of avoiding the long call waits) - the response was they can't find them. I then get a text asking me to call defeating the point of the app entirely. 2 days later they call to confirm its been lost and we need to do it all again...."
Ravenwoods,Merger was a bad idea,11/25/2021,1,"Since the merger of the surgery's the service has gone down hill. I cannot get an appoinment, have to wait long periods on the phone to talk to someone. Unable to book any doctors appointment online, needed to see doctor for past 3 months but unable to wait holding on the phone. NHS service has degraded due to this merger. The Norwich Road surgey had very good service until its merger, please, please, please revert back to the way it was. Trying to see  the same doctor for continued treatment is a nightmare now. This new system does not work, very poor service as a result of it.
Thanks"
Ravenwoods,Much better,11/18/2021,5,It used to be days and days before you would get to even get to speak to the receptionist and then weeks for an appointment. The new AskMyGP has meant I used it about 6pm last night and they called me this morning and got me in within an hour of the call. really good. (Chesterfield drive branch)
Ravenwoods,Never any issues,6/16/2023,4,I use AskMyGP all the time and never had problems. I have managed to get on to it the night before to submit something that then gets dealt with first thing the next day.
Ravenwoods,Nightmare,8/18/2022,1,After having sore hands for 3 weeks rang for appointment advised Pharmacist.  Pharmacist gave moisturiser but said ring 111 as a precaution.  Several 111  calls later told to take antihistamines for symptoms but see GP after weekend.   Lots more calls to GP and given stronger antihistamine (it was'nt).  How hard would it be for a simple blood test?   Thinking of going to A&E.
Ravenwoods,Nightmare,8/18/2022,1,"Rang for appointment for 3 weeks of painful hands, after several calls back advised Pharmacist who gave moisturiser but also said ring 111.   More calls to and from 111  advised  antihistamine for symptoms and call GP after weekend.  Many more calls and changed antihistamine for something stronger (which isn't)  and keep using cream.  A few different diagnosis from these calls,  arthritis, dry skin, neurological pain and allergy.   How about a blood test?"
Ravenwoods,No Access,5/18/2022,2,"No matter what I do, I cannot get to speak to anyone. AskMyGP is shut. I phone in and you are waiting for ages and I cannot when I am at work. It is not working and they need to listen to what is the reality. I know they are short staffed, so this needs higher intervention or those that are here, will leave as it must be difficult. I need to see a GP and will end up having to go to A&E and that is no good for anyone!"
Ravenwoods,No appointment available for sick child,10/19/2021,1,"Called 8am when opened number 50 in queue, hour on phone, went in person to Deben road told no appointment available for a sick child who was advised by 111 to have urgent appointment"
Ravenwoods,No follow ups.,7/11/2022,2,"My mum has a problem with her right leg. I have on numerous occasions contacted the surgery about this.She has been seen by a clinical practitioner,and they tell you she will have follow ups,nothing comes of it, ridiculous. My mum is 87,lives alone and I her daughter live in Hampshire. Too many patients,not enough staff!! Seriously need someone to sort out this problem,before a patient is critically ill. It feels as if there is no support,for the individual,that is sad."
Ravenwoods,Not a service,5/18/2022,1,"This is not a service. A service it when you get something. I and my family are getting nothing, we have had to go to A&E as even 111 could not get us in. the physical doors may be open now but that means nothing. AskMyGP submissions, ignored. Telephone access, impossible as we get cut off. Not sure what we are supposed to do when this happens and desperate for help."
Ravenwoods,Not being able to speak or see a dr when need,5/19/2022,1,"I asked my gp Friday and it’s now  Thursday, still not sorted."
Ravenwoods,NOT GOOD,3/15/2022,1,TRIED TO SEND EMAIL TO WWW.CARDINALMEDICALPRACTICE.CO.UK WEB ADDRESS DID NOT WORK
Ravenwoods,Not good enough,5/31/2022,1,I wasn’t told that my blood test results showed I had got Glandular fever. 6 weeks later when I called them as I still wasn’t well with a very swollen and sore throat and neck they then told me. I have probably passed it on to many people as I wasn’t aware they just kept telling me it was probably long covid. I have called several times as I’ve been so unwell but it was never mentioned.
Ravenwoods,Not great in afternoon,5/19/2023,3,"On the day this morning was ok using AskMyGP and I am in quite quickly as a response. It is in the afternoon that things are not as great as AskMyGP is generally switched off by about 9am, in my experience and the phone ques are very long and all appointments are going. I have never been offered a GP appointment once yet since being here for last couple of years."
Ravenwoods,Not replying to enquiries,4/29/2022,1,Was asked to contact surgery re medication review. I used ask my gp. Email eventually sent back saying reception would be in contact to make an appointment.  This was 10 days ago. Nobody has phoned or made contact.
Ravenwoods,Notification needed,11/18/2021,4,I used AskMyGP and made the request to be seen the following Friday. There is no follow up to let you know that that has happened when I submit it. The system is very easy to use and much faster than hanging on the telephone. I have appointment here (Deben Road) after a separate submission earlier today.
Ravenwoods,One hour and a half in a queue!,9/11/2021,1,Absolutely appalling having to wait in a queue for one and a half hours to speak to a receptionist. Phoning for my 90 year old mother who doesn’t understand the system! No wonder people are over using our struggling A&E!!!
Ravenwoods,Ongoing access issues with AskMyGP,8/3/2023,1,"Since the previous feedback in early February about the state of AskMyGP at Cardinal Medical Practice, the practice has continued with its strategy of early shutdown of online access to patient appointments almost every day. In recent days, the shutdown message has subtly changed from a ""lack of routine appointment slots"" to concerns about ""reaching a safe limit"". If, by its own admission, the practice is borderline unsafe, should this ring alarm bells? Should the public reasonably expect a second opinion from an organisation that is focussed on patient safety i.e. an urgent unannounced inspection from the CQC? One also has to question whether the decision/judgement by the GP partners at Cardinal to admit in public to safety concerns at their own practice was a wise one?

Whatever the messaging from Cardinal, the root cause of the problem is obviously a lack of clinicians. In late 2020, prior to the merger of the Norwich Road, Chesterfield Drive and the Deben Road surgeries into Cardinal Medical Practice, there was a public consultation about the proposed merger. Two important outcomes from that consultation exercise were the fact that patients were concerned about telephone access and a lack of GP appointments. In the formal merger proposition submitted by Cardinal and Suffolk Primary Care (SPC) - who were driving the merger and are ultimately responsible for the overall running of Cardinal Medical Practice - they specifically promised more Care Navigators and more GP sessions, and this was discussed at the PCCC meeting in February 2021. HealthWatch Suffolk were present at that PCCC meeting, and the matter was reported at the time in the EADT. In 9 2021, just over six months after those promises were made, Cardinal was referred by the local MP to the CQC for, among other things, failing to provide adequate telephone access for its patients. And now, two years on, we still have a situation where the GP partners at Cardinal are clearly failing to employ enough clinicians to satisfy patient demand. What is the point of a public consultation and the contractual promises made by Cardinal and SPC if nobody is prepared to hold Cardinal and SPC to account?

Also at the PCCC meeting in February 2021, there was a comment from one member of the PCCC panel that if a practice serving 30,000 patients were to fail it would present major problems for the local CCG, and an assertion from the chair of the PCCC that such a practice might be deemed to large to fail. Do these observations allude to the real reason as to why we are not seeing the IESCCG / SNEE ICB taking robust/decisive action to resolve issues at Cardinal? Why has there not been any follow-up assessment of Cardinal Medical Practice from the CQC following Cardinal's ""Requires Improvement"" rating from nearly a year ago? If the practice is unsafe and continues to be unsafe, at what stage will the IESCCG / SNEE ICB / CQC intervene and take action (i.e. implement a regime change) to protect the public?"
Ravenwoods,Outstanding service and care,5/13/2022,5,"I have been a patient at Norwich Road Surgery for over 23 years, during which time I have had to call on their help a number of times. I’m autistic and have other mental health issues, the care I have received has saved my life, one particular GP has stood with me as I faced numerous battles, he is dedicated, sincere and supportive. A couple of months ago, a suspicious sore appeared on my arm, from diagnosis to the removal of the cancer was less than 4 weeks. Every contact I have had at the surgery has been positive"
Ravenwoods,Over an hour waiting to speak to someone,11/16/2021,1,Awful- couldn't do the ask a GP as it wouldn't accept my log in details despite me using them for repeat prescriptions every month for over a year.
Ravenwoods,Painful bowels,2/15/2022,1,"Terrible customer service, incorrectly prescribed medication even after we told them about allergies, phone queue over 35 min wait rubbish."
Ravenwoods,Phone is terrible trying to get through,11/16/2021,3,Can’t get through sometimes get cut off. Also can’t get an appointment for months so quite bad at the moment.
Ravenwoods,Phone line issue,11/18/2021,3,"I am unable to use AskMyGP so walked into Deben Road today as I need an appointment.  They were unable to do that. It was explained to me by HWS staff who were there that the calls go to Chesterfield Drive and they all use the AskMyGP form, which I appreciate, however, when I ring the phone ends up being hung up. (It was explained that the system is digital and there can sometimes be gliches, as no member of staff would hang up).  
I will now try and ring later this afternoon now that this has all been explained to me, and hope it works then as cannot go online."
Ravenwoods,Poor communication,8/17/2022,1,"Received a text on Friday to discuss blood test results, I read it after the surgery had closed due to being asleep due to working nights.
On Monday I contacted via AMGP at 8am requesting call back ideally by 10am mentioning that I work nights and need to sleep. No response by 10am so I submitted another request explaining I was going to sleep and to contact my via email with the results, I received a fairly prompt response saying I was “down to be called today”. Stayed up until midday and couldn’t keep awake any longer so went to sleep. Received a missed call around 5pm and a follow up message once again asking to contact the surgery to discuss results and also to book a follow up blood test. 
On Tuesday I submitted once again on AMGP, this time requesting a call after 5pm, again explaining I work nights and sleep daytime. Upon waking up I see I have replies on AMGP explaining the results and to contact surgery again after having the second blood test. Why could this not have been explained in the first instance?  Disrupted my sleep pattern and added unnecessary anxiety."

Ravenwoods,Poor communication!,6/26/2022,1,Have wait over an hour to speak to care navigator only to be told get an appointment via AskGP icon!
Ravenwoods,"Poor communication, can't get an appt",5/24/2022,1,"I was in Chesterfield Drive Surgery today and the nurse practitioner I saw asked me to make an appt for 2 weeks time to have more re blood tests and another blood pressure test-receptionist got annoyed with me and told me that I have to go on Ask My GP! I got the nurse to ask her for me and as soon as the nurse left, receptionist got annoyed again, told me to wait and that she had to go upstairs - she came back with an appointment, but it's at a different surgery where nobody knows my history. Continuity of care is very important with ongoing issues and it's no wonder I have waited so long for a partial diagnosis when nobody sees the same health care professional  more than once - very shabby"
Ravenwoods,Quick  and excellent response,1/31/2022,5,"I have used the askmyGP service several times now and have always had a quick response from the Dr. It was obvious that she had also looked up my medical record and was aware of a number of possible diagnoses. I was very happy with her treatment plan for me and her responses during follow up consultations. 
The Pharmacist also very quickly responded when I needed a meds’ review and was very knowledgeable. Although my medication hasn’t changed I felt that consultation was very worthwhile, as he also explained more about the drugs I am taking."
Ravenwoods,Quick and responsive,2/5/2023,4,"I found this time that they were very quick and responsive at a very concerning time for me. I had very strange symptoms and called the surgery. I saw a Nurse Practitioner who ordered bloods and had concerns. Rightly so, as suspected a Stroke. It was not that but they ordered a MRI - Had this within a week and a tumour was found, thankfully benign."
Ravenwoods,Quick and Simple to use,1/31/2022,5,I have used ask my GP several times already and each time have found it to be a quick and efficient service. For those that work full time and not having time to wait on hold it is perfect and I intend to use this moving forward
Ravenwoods,Quick response,12/21/2021,5,Had a flare up of an old condition and have had to call GP a couple of times over the last few weeks. Had a response within the day every time. Very sympathetic GPs and medication issued.
Ravenwoods,Really poor communication,2/8/2022,1,"Requested an appointment at 8:15 am as surgery ""now operating an on the day service"". 5 hours later still no further communication ! Very annoying that I have to keep checking my emails and the Cardinal Medical Practice website in case I miss if they finally book me an appointment which very nearly happened previously! 

Of course I could telephone and wait an hour for my call to be answered to then be told to go through Ask my GP ! Not very professional and certainly not a good system. Also very confusing that they say we should request the appointment on the day we are available but then that we may have to wait 1-3 days for a response?"
Ravenwoods,"Rudness, GDPR issues and long telephone wait",11/29/2021,1,"1. Your phone message has been the same for 6 months + and its nearly 2 minutes in length; after calling today being told you cannot register appointments on the phone and to use the app. Change your first intro message to; we can only book appointments through the askmygp app.

2. When registering in reception your touch screen device leaves the persons details up."
Ravenwoods,Shambles,11/22/2021,1,New and only way to book an appointment implemented but left in a queue for 1hr and 15mins to be told along with that they couldn't book an appointment and I had to do it online. Maybe the message on the hold music should have been clearer. Feel completely uncared for by this practice no wonder mental health is at an all time low.
Ravenwoods,Still not adequate ventialtion or masks.,9/30/2022,1,Ipswich hospital has re-introduced masks. Hopefully FFP3 which are designed to protect wearer against airborne transmission of Covid. The hospital is re-introducing masks because *30% of all hospitalisations with Covid are hospital aquired*. Patients are catching Covid while in hospital. And many are dying because of this. Staff here are mostly helpful. But obviously unaware of the dangers posed.
Ravenwoods,Struggle to get through on phone,11/10/2021,3,I really do find it difficult to get through on the phone and you can be 36 in the queue. It's very difficult to access the surgery and if you turn up to try and book they say you have to call.
Ravenwoods,Such hard work,7/9/2022,1,"Cannot believe how hard it is to use this ""wonderful "" new service..When you have put you need advice ASAP and they take 48hrs to reply it's terrible.  Especially when the patient has to be admitted to hospital. Please go back to the old system when you could talk to a human it was so much more efficient."
Ravenwoods,Terrible,4/5/2022,1,"Ask my GP has been down for over a week now & we cant get through on phone line, resorting to A&E when it should be a GP."
Ravenwoods,Terrible no access for me,5/18/2022,1,"I have now had to re-register with my old surgery (I will not disclose this) out of the area in order to access my post cancer treatment medication! This surgery said I would have to wait 3 weeks as a new patient and would not issue my medication in the meantime. It is disgusting as they are putting lives at risk. No doctor spoke to me, that was just what reception told me. How can they make that judgement?!"
Ravenwoods,terrible service,12/16/2021,1,"No care given to me as a patient, which is unsettling to say the least."
Ravenwoods,The ask my GP is useless,3/21/2022,1,i could not book an annual review it is easier via the telephone although the waiting time to be answered are unacceptable
Ravenwoods,The most horrible practice,11/17/2021,1,"My son got a coronavirus. I made a call to the Norwich Road Surgery, which is a part of Cardinal Practice, asked for a consultation for my son and me because I am pregnant. After three days there is no call. Brilliant service."
Ravenwoods,The staff are polite and friendly but….,10/11/2021,3,"I find the people who work at the practice are friendly and do their best to help. However, there are often problems with continuity of treatment plans and breakdown of communication between staff. With that said, they do endeavour to resolve your issues if you speak out about them. I’m sure things will get better after the merger is complete."
Ravenwoods,Too long to get through by phone.,11/20/2021,2,Feel unsupported medically with doctors not attending surgeries.

Ravenwoods,Tried to use ask my GP s said not available,8/18/2022,2,"Rang surgery after ASK MY GP not available and was 21 in a que took over an hour to talk to reception, wife gave symptoms and was told no one could reply to her problem for a day and has tried to get a face to face appointment and they will let us know if it is possible . The service from this surgery leaves a lot to be desired at the moment."
Ravenwoods,Trying to call - 40 mins in a que,2/11/2021,3,It doesn't seem to matter what time of day I call there is usually always 40+ in the que resulting in being on hold for a long period of time. I never had this issue before the surgeries merged. Apart from this a good service. This makes it even more difficult to get an appointment
Ravenwoods,trying to speak to this place is a nightmare,1/12/2021,1,"Trying to speak to anyone is a nightmare..this was before the three medical centers joined together .  and is only getting worse, and if  you do get through... there always seems to be a problem with their phones....  ."
Ravenwoods,Unable to book an appointment here,2/12/2021,1,I'm still unable  to  book  appointment !
Ravenwoods,Unable to book in to suit me,3/20/2022,1,I wanted to book an appointment when it suited me and to arrange blood tests but was unable to even though it was a week away.

Ravenwoods,Unable to speak to someone about cholesterol,11/4/2022,1,"A letter sent from the surgery on 15/2/22 identified that I had a cholesterol problem, 3 sets of blood tests taken and as of today I have had and cannot obtain any information on my problem. I need to speak to someone who can tell me what the issue is and what is the way forward."
Ravenwoods,Unacceptable telephone call waiting times,8/11/2021,1,"I have been a patient with this practice for many years now. Since these three surgeries merged, the customer care and service is awful. I just tried to call and was told I am number 36 in the queue - how do you manage to speak with someone when you work full-time and have limited time available to make calls to your doctor's surgery? I can use e-Consult but the questions are completely irrelevant and just send me round and round in circles which is incredibly frustrating."
Ravenwoods,Used ask my gp for some help regarding back pain,8/8/2022,1,Have made contact to try and get help for back pain to be told to go to the pharmacy had back pain for over a week yet pharmacy medications can only be used max of 3 days
Ravenwoods,used AskMyGP & ok,5/18/2022,3,"I have had hit and miss with AskMyGP. Sometimes it is working and I get a message or call the same day/48hrs. Other times it has been closed down. My gripe is, don't say it will be 24 hours if it won't be."
Ravenwoods,"Used on line system, very good",12/13/2021,5,A return call from surgery within an hour of my on line request took the anxiety out of my problem. Very good.
Ravenwoods,Useless and no continuity of care,4/19/2022,1,"I have been suffering with back pain for 2 weeks. I avoid contacting the surgery to begin with using the pharmacy but when the pain became too much I contacted the surgery. They prescribed me something that had no effect. They then left it to the gp out of hours service they told me to contact my surgery when it reopens because they have to see you. Today I tried again, they have prescribed a medication I’ve tried before that hasn’t worked on ask my gp outside of its operating hours so I can’t reply."
Ravenwoods,Very bad.,4/28/2022,1,"Long phone waits, no response on emails, unhelpful  surgery staff, always understaffed, never follow up on issues, not keen on actually seeing the patient. I ended up taken to the hospital from my work place and Cardinal medical practice lost my notes from hospital, wouldn't see me, refused to book me an emergency blood test."
Ravenwoods,Very difficult for people without IT skills,4/13/2022,1,"Very slow to get a response at times, I would rather speak to someone than virtually especially for my health. I find it really impersonal."
Ravenwoods,Very easy to use,11/18/2021,5,"As someone from the older generation, I cannot recommend this enough. It was so frustrating trying to get through on the telephone before now, but this morning I put this form in and within an hour they got in touch and got me in to the Chesterfield drive site. It was so quick and easy to use."
Ravenwoods,Very poor patient liaison,11/15/2021,1,"Quicker to visit than phone, Far too long for test results resulting in non activity of problem."
Ravenwoods,Very rude GP,11/30/2021,1,"System to talk to a GP has changed with no communication from the surgery. The new system encourages you to state what you think the problem is and a doctor then calls me and rudely tells me I shouldn't 'make statements' about having a suspected disease. Think about your systems, your communication and your approach. Really awful!"
Ravenwoods,Very rude lady answering phone,11/15/2021,1,I phoned for an appointment the woman was very rude shouted on phone at me 3 times as I requested a certain nurse to see.
Ravenwoods,very well run practice,7/10/2021,5,"norwich rd surgery has always maintained the highest standards, and i have no doubt the new combined practice will continue as such."
Ravenwoods,Wasted my time.,9/22/2022,1,"Made a telephone appointment without my knowledge, text me to remind me and then cancelled without informing me."
Ravenwoods,website for me is impossible to access,3/10/2022,1,"website impossible to use i cannot log in to order repeat medication,doctors appointments, it seems that it must have only G mail  requests, I do not have a g mail account and do not want to change  my existing e mail account, your telephone land line is usually always engaged,"
Ravenwoods,Wife couldn't get logged on 'ASKMyGp',11/22/2021,2,"My wife needed to login (to the new 'AskMyGp') to see what was going on with her prescription review - she had been told different things on the phone by two people at the surgery - one said she would get a call back (which never happened) and the other said that wasn't necessary and issued the repeat prescription anyway. When she went online her details and request options were all greyed out.  When she tried to register for 'AskMyGp' for the first time it rejected her passwords and said her email address was already taken!  She had to call and stay on the line for ages to ask them to sort it out - they have gone away to look into it.  I managed to login for the first time after a bit of a struggle, though it wouldn't accept what was a reasonably secure password - I had to use the random letters suggested by my computer to get it to work.  I used to work in IT and tested these sort of systems - goodness knows how the less tech savvy will get on with it!  If you say anything to the staff they just repeat the very basic instructions which my wife already knew, and had followed. They don't see that there are issues and likely a lack of testing/quality. Hopefully it will at least be an improvement over having to stay on the line for over an hour just to pass a simple message."
Ravenwoods,Wife has 15 wasps stings to the face head ces,7/27/2022,1,Phoned up cardinal surgery at 0800 told to go to the chemist.chemist said Sting's are so severe.that my wife should see the doctor.my wife got Intouch with the doctor at cardinal surgery again.and was told a doctor will be in touch.no doctor called.my wife then phoned the . cardinal surgery every 2hrs .to find out if there was a doctor coming.i phoned the cardinal surgery at 1802.and was told to phone 111 if no doctor has got in touch by 1830.by this time my wife was in so much pain.now 111 have so many calls we are in a 45 to 1 HR waiting time. So my wife was waiting 10hrs for a call from a doctor who never has been stung by one wasp let alone 15 to the head.
Ravenwoods,Yearly blood tests and health check,11/22/2021,5,'AskMYGp' is good for getting an appt. Nurse very friendly and helpful
Reynard,A brilliant surgery,6/1/2022,5,"I like to speak to someone to arrange appointments so I prefer to call the surgery rather than use the online option. I have used econsult recently  and it was easy to use,  I just prefer to call as it gets things sorted quicker. The surgery have fantastic staff and you get to see who you need to see for the issue you have."
Reynard,A fantastic practice,10/26/2021,5,"Very helpful staff, I really can't fault the care provided and the staff who are excellent and so friendly."
Reynard,A good surgery,1/30/2023,5,Booking appointments has been ok and I've been able to get both face to face and telephone consultations when I've needed them. It would be nice to have a surgery back in Mildenhall again as it was easier to attend appointments there and for ongoing medication it would create less work if we didn't  have to request repeat prescriptions so regularly.  Overall its a good surgery.
Reynard,A good surgery,6/1/2022,4,I don't need to use the surgery much but when I do the care is good and I tend to arrange appointments by calling reception and waiting for a call back from the GP.
Reynard,A lovely surgery,8/8/2022,5,A really lovely surgery. The staff are great and offer amazing support.  Everything I've needed help with from appointments to advice they've always done very well.
Reynard,A very good practice,1/25/2019,5,"When I first registered here, some years ago now, an appointment on the day was fairly easy-not quite so easy now with the increase in demand from local population increase. I use both branches (Red Lodge and Mildenhall) for convenience and this is still a very good practice."
Reynard,A very good surgery.,6/1/2022,4,I find waiting on the phone at times difficult so I use econsult too which works ok. When I'm told that a doctor will call at some point I find my anxiety levels go up as I'm not sure when they will be calling and I don't want to miss them.  The link worker at the surgery is very good but I'm having to wait for CBT and haven't been given a date of when to expect it.
Reynard,Access by phone can be difficult,3/27/2020,4,This is a good surgery overall but it can be difficult to get through to the surgery on the phone. Now I am aware of eConsult I will give it a go when it is up and running.
Reynard,Advised to use econsult,6/1/2022,4,"The surgery have asked patients to use econsult to contact the surgery which I have done however the system when I've entered the information said to seek further medical help. I'm now unsure what to do now as been told to use this and not call the surgery.  The care once you do see someone is very good, I can't fault the doctors I just don't like econsult."
Reynard,All good,10/27/2021,5,I mainly only really visit the surgery for my repeat prescriptions and that always works really well and there are no issues. Overall the surgery works well for me.
Reynard,All good,10/26/2021,5,Phone appointments work really well and I'm not concerned about access as you don't always need a face to face appointment. They do a superb job and staff are great.
Reynard,All great,1/30/2023,5,"Its all great, have no qualms about anything. The staff are accommodating when arranging appointments and they are on the ball and will remind you if you forget to arrange a check up. The text reminders for appointments are great and I pick up my medication each month with no issues or delays."
Reynard,All very good,1/25/2019,5,Generally I find being a patient here to be very good. Happy with nurses and doctors. I was once 5-6 minutes late booking in at reception and I was made to feel quite bad. The hold up was traffic related and unavoidable but I was seen. I was once referred to West Suffolk hospital for a test and I had to chase up my results but really these two issues are pretty minor in what has otherwise been a very positive experience.
Reynard,All very pleasant,1/30/2023,5,"Its rare that I need to come to the surgery but when I do it is very good.  The GP sent a letter to me inviting me in for my most recent appointment but generally I talk to the doctor on the phone and most issues are dealt with in this way, getting to see a GP is a bit limited.  The phones can be busy but the music that is played is quite good now.  The staff are very polite and friendly."
Reynard,Appointments available at certain times,6/1/2022,4,"I have regular INR blood tests but getting an appointment when needed is difficult as I'm reliant on family to bring me in to have them done but the appointments are only available on certain days and times which is problematic.  The practice nurse and doctors are marvellous, the staff are always great and I regularly see the practice nurse who is so supportive and friendly."
Reynard,Been given emergency appointments on day,8/25/2019,4,"Non emergency appointments had to wait a couple of weeks. Equally, have been given urgent appointments on the day. Customer service skills could be a little better on arrival at times."
Reynard,Blood tests fine to get,1/30/2023,4,"Getting a blood test appointment at the surgery has been fine and the surgery works well for us. The staff are very friendly and helpful, we're very happy with it."
Reynard,Brilliant,1/30/2023,5,Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and when I ring they do all they can to help and sort the issue out. I've found the telephone consultations work really well and have always been given an appointment when they've been needed too. I'm confident in the care provided by my GP and my diabetes is well managed by the nurse.
Reynard,Busy phone lines,6/1/2022,2,"The phone lines in the morning are busy and by the time you get through there can be no appointments available. The process in place makes you feel that they don't particularly want to see you either and in the past I've been told to go straight to A&E rather than them seeing me. It would be good to have more parking spaces available, may be the area at the back could be cleared."
Reynard,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,Phones are very busy in the mornings which is off putting. I've found that it is best to come up to the surgery to book appointments as its easier. I've had to wait about a month to have todays blood test.  Overall though they are doing a good job and I'm happy with the care and treatment provided . It's just getting through to the surgery thats the issue.
Reynard,Can always get appointment when needed,8/25/2019,5,"The staff here are amazing. I am pleased with the GP and nurse practitioner, I feel this surgery listens more to me with my child's conditions."
Reynard,Can't fault the service,1/25/2019,5,My whole family is registered here. We joined when we moved to the area seven years ago. They are very good when it comes to the children. My son was poorly this morning and when I phoned in there were no appointments but my doctor called me back later and invited us in to see him this afternoon. You can't fault that service!
Reynard,Can't fault the surgery,6/1/2022,5,"I have great continuity as I seen the same GP each time which I find really beneficial. The staff are great, helpful and friendly and it really is a good surgery where appointments are available when they are needed."
Reynard,Can't praise them enough,1/25/2019,5,"I can't praise this practice enough. I use this and Mildenhall branch depending on where I can get seen most conveniently. I prefer it here as it is very easy to park and the staff (both here and at Mildenhall) are all very, very good. I find it a nice friendly place and people smile!"
Reynard,Care is good,1/30/2023,4,The care is good and staff are helpful and friendly. It would be nice to have a better idea of when a doctor would be calling and if they could open on Saturdays it would be really helpful especially for those who work.
Reynard,Cheerful bunch of people,1/25/2019,4,They all seem to be a cheerful bunch of people and a smile always helps. I think much about the practice is first class but I do find waiting for up to 3 weeks for a routine appointment to be a bit of a problem. I think the consultation time allowed is insufficient but I guess that is general and not specific to here.
Reynard,Consistently excellent service - thank you!!,7/8/2019,5,A caring and professional team headed up by a fantastic senior doctor. I cannot fault my consistently high level of care at both Reynard Surgery and White House Surgeries. I am grateful to have this care on my doorstep!
Reynard,Delayed,10/26/2021,4,Have found getting a face to face difficult and have been asked to take pictures but they weren't clear enough so it has delayed things. Staff have been excellent though and it's nice that some of the restrictions have been lifted so you can go in the surgery and wait.
Reynard,Difficult arranging a blood test,1/30/2023,3,"I've had problems arranging a blood test and it has taken 3 months in total. Not being able to get the appointment meant that my medication wouldn't be released by the pharmacy, so I then had to go back to the doctor to sort it all out as I have to have my medication.  I chased 2 or three times during this period and was told I would be contacted but wasn't. The waits on the phones aren't too bad and it is easier than going online."
Reynard,Difficult at times,1/30/2023,5,"Getting appointments, either face to face or telephone call backs can be difficult at times however the staff are good and it's just the availability of appointments that can be an issue. Staff are helpful and accommodating and it has always been a good surgery. Its just  a little frustrating but considering the current situation its understandable."
Reynard,Dr is amazing,9/30/2022,5,They are always contactable and have a good relationship with them and they know us well. It gives us confidence. Its a great surgery we've never had any issues.
Reynard,Drs are lovely,12/10/2022,4,The phones are very busy and when it takes so long to get through it is off-putting and frustrating. My mum isn't calling because she believes she won't get through. I've used e-consult and it just kicks you out and you have to call the surgery anyway. It feels more of a rigmarole than it used to be. Drs are lovely and great with the kids and once you are in to see them it's great. It would be nice to be told when call backs are likely to happen just so you can plan a little better.
Reynard,E consult works really well,10/26/2021,5,"The e consult system works really well, I got a call back quickly and have arranged an appointment for tomorrow. The staff are very helpful and friendly and it all works really well."
Reynard,Easy to get an appointment,7/25/2016,5,"Fast diagnosis - hospital - physio.  I signed on to the surgery and within 1 week had an appointment with my doctor.  He diagnosed OA hip and referred for x-ray.  Newmarket hospital appointment within 2 days.  1 week later called back to surgery for results, same day appointment.  Prescription & PT arranged.  very smooth, professional service"
Reynard,Econsult didn't work,10/26/2021,3,I completed an econsult and was told the form required would be sent out to me. It hasn't arrived so I've had to come to the surgery to pick one up which is disappointing. Getting through on the phone at the moment can take some time but the care provided by staff is very good. I think the closure of the Mildenhall branch is an issue especially for those who do not drive.
Reynard,Econsult worked well,10/27/2021,4,"I used econsult and it worked well, I was given an appointment for the next day. At times it is difficult to see a doctor face to face although I have seen the nurse. I like the new electric doors, makes it much easier to get in to the building, just need a second set for the next doors now."
Reynard,Even better over time,1/25/2019,5,I have been a patient here for over 25 years. It was a small practice which is now much bigger due to the increase in population locally which has been substantial. They have always been quite helpful and I have to say the practice has improved over time. I have no issues at all.
Reynard,Everything else is A1,1/25/2019,5,"The only thing that is less than first class here is the pharmacy in my experience. We were told a prescription would be ready to be collected after 4.00 and in the event it wasn't ready till the next day. In truth had we been told it would be the next day we would have been fine about but in the event we had to make two journeys. Everything else here (location, staff, reception, parking and clinicians) is A1. I would say the stand out thing is the very positive staff attitude."
Reynard,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"The busy phone lines are a little frustrating at times but generally they are very good and appointments are available whenever they are needed and once you get through. The staff are also great, very supportive."
Reynard,Excellent,10/27/2021,5,Not had any problems and the telephone system being used now seems to be much better. Staff are excellent and explain things really well and are always pleasant and cheerful.
Reynard,Excellent service provided here,3/27/2020,5,"SueM - No faults here, they provide an excellent service to me and my wife."
Reynard,Fantastic surgery.!,8/2/2022,5,"I think I never had such caring and attentive GPs.  Mostly with my kids,(but also with us)   even if they are super busy, they always find a spot to see them,  making sure nothing is wrong, and as a mum that is super important. I feel safe and I feel secure with them.  so thanks very very much !"
Reynard,Found access difficult,10/26/2021,1,"I've found it difficult as you have to wait in the whole for a call back from a doctor, surely an am or pm slot at least could be given to make it easier to plan. I'm in considerable pain waiting for a call back so I don't see that the econsult service works very well. You're not told who will be calling you either, would be much better if there were timed slots for call backs."
Reynard,Friendly staff,8/25/2019,4,Friendly staff and helpful. Online appointments work well for me.
Reynard,Good continuity,9/30/2022,5,I rarely use the surgery and have no problems getting my medication. There is good continuity when I do need an appointment and I've found that econsult has worked well with quick responses and it sorts out the issues too. A very efficient good surgery
Reynard,GP listens well.,8/25/2019,4,They seem to be able to get an appointment on the day. Very friendly and helpful. GP listens well.
Reynard,Great support,10/26/2021,5,"I've found the staff at the surgery really supportive. My doctor was great throughout my pregnancy when I needed some mental health support. Whenever my baby has needed to be seen they've seen him straight away. I've contacted the surgery using econsult and it worked really well and I've had a phone consultation too which worked really well too. There is an assumption when you call that you are able to use online services like econsult, which I can, but not everyone is able to and this needs to be remembered."
Reynard,Happy overall,7/2/2019,4,Parking today was very bad here - it isn't usually that bad. I have had to come back for an appointment today because I feel things weren't properly explained last week-hence the four stars for explanation. I am happy overall though.
Reynard,Happy overall with surgery,3/27/2020,5,I rated this 5 stars because I am overall happy with the surgery and I cannot identify any issues.
Reynard,I don't know how they are still so good,1/25/2019,5,"I don't know how they are still so good. There have been so many new houses built locally and so many new residents but still the service is so good. I may have to wait a few days for an appointment now (than I did a few years ago) and on a busy day I might be 10-15 minutes late being called in. However, if I am really off colour they always fit me in and sort me out. Great!"
Reynard,I feel I am lucky,7/2/2019,5,"I prefer to come here (Reynard Surgery, Red Lodge) rather than the other practice (Whitehouse at Mildenhall) just for the parking. Staff are friendly and helpful at both and doctors and nurses are all good so I choose for convenience. I realise I am lucky to have this luxury from what I hear on the news about NHS services."
Reynard,I really can't fault it,7/2/2019,5,I really can't fault it. I use here and Whitehouse Mildenhall depending on which has soonest appointments. The best thing here is the parking which is very convenient. All the staff are very friendly.
Reynard,It's been fine to date,3/30/2020,4,I am a new patient to this surgery and so I have limited experience here but I find it to be a good surgery and to date its been fine.
Reynard,Like the phone consultations,10/26/2021,4,I find it's good when they phone you for the consultation as it saves visiting unnecessarily. I'm confident that I'll be offered a face to face with a doctor after speaking to them if its needed. The only issue with the phone is that you have to call first thing and by the time you get through the appointments are limited.
Reynard,Link hard to see,8/25/2019,3,I booked my appointment online but I found that the link to get appointments was hard to see
Reynard,Long phone waits,6/1/2022,4,"There are long waits on the phone to get through to reception in the morning and when you do get through I have been told there are no appointments available that day and call back tomorrow. I have seen the nurse and she has been very good, supportive and caring."
Reynard,Look after me very well,6/8/2016,5,They look after me very well and I get appointments within a few days when I need to go.
Reynard,Love this surgery,9/30/2022,5,"I'm really sad that I am moving house soon and will be leaving the practice. They have been brilliant here, caring and helpful and the staff are all great."
Reynard,Lovely surgery,10/27/2021,5,Everything is prompt whether it's getting through on the phone or waiting for a call back it all works really well. Perfect staff really great at what they do.
Reynard,My GP has been excellent,3/30/2020,5,"I am very happy with this surgery, my GP has been excellent, my GP has even come out every time I have needed it at home, whenever I have needed them they have always been there. This is a very good surgery."
Reynard,New patient but impressed so far,10/27/2021,5,"I've been really impressed so far. We only moved to the practice recently but staff have been great and it was easy to get my their flu vaccination as the surgery actually called to arrange it, really pleased."
Reynard,No problems,9/13/2018,5,"It all works well and I've had no problems at all getting appointments and the triage system works well. Econsult is good to use ad enables quick access and support. There's good communication with doctors and they explain issues well.  I've always had appointments with the most appropriate person in the team.I have had issues with the NHS app, it's not working well at the moment so I can't see the messages and have needed to call the surgery for them to read them to me. Staff are trying to help but it appears that its an app issue."
Reynard,Not as good as it used to be,4/12/2018,3,"On the question of getting an appointment when I am unwell. I have to 'phone in at 8.00 and I have been on for over an hour. When I did get through there were no appointments left for that day, which I suppose I should have guessed during the call. This practice isn't as good for me as it used to be but there have been 500 new houses and lots of new people in the area with no extra capacity at the surgery. Good doctors and nurses but big demand!"
Reynard,Nurses and other staff great,10/27/2021,4,"It can be difficult to see someone face to face and with my condition I really would like someone to see me. The phone line does have queues at times but nurses and other staff are great, friendly and part of the community."
Reynard,Overall attitude is very good,7/2/2019,5,"The overall attitude of staff is very good-my score of 3 stars reflects a single episode last year with the management rather than staff. I have scored 'waiting' quite low as well as there is always a minimum of a 10 minute wait but I have waited much, much longer. Those issues aside I am very satisfied and happy to be a patient here."
Reynard,Overall very good.,7/2/2019,4,I was an hour and a half late here once. There was probably a reason but no one told me though I was given an apology by the doctor-my blood pressure soared! I only come here if I can't get an appointment at Mildenhall and overall I suppose I would rate the service overall as very good.
Reynard,Parking is difficult at times,3/30/2020,5,"Getting access to the surgery by phone is very difficult and parking can be difficult at times, but overall it is a very good surgery, I am pleased to know about the introduction of eConsult as another option to contact the surgery."
Reynard,Parking is helpful,7/2/2019,3,"I have given a very low score for being seen on time because in my experience you are always at least 35 minutes late being called in, though the nurses tend to be more timely. My 'explanation' score is also a bit low and that is around one particular consultation with a nurse. I was told by the nurse that she would explain something later in the consultation and that didn't happen. I had to ask and I might well have forgotten. I use both surgeries (Whitihouse and Reynard) as routine appointments are about a week, I go wherever is quickest. Parking at Reynard is helpful though."
Reynard,Perfect,12/10/2022,5,"It's always been perfect here as they get you in quickly and there are really good staff, really can't fault the surgery, it's amazing with great doctors and nurses. Nothing needs to change."
Reynard,Phone and econsult work well,6/1/2022,5,I find that phone and econsult work well for the situations I've had. The only issue is getting to the surgery when specimens need to be bought in. I don't drive and have mobility issues so getting here is difficult. I'm happy to see any of the GPs and I see the most appropriate person for the issue I have.
Reynard,Prefer to call,6/1/2022,5,"I've been invited in for a blood test today and more recently but haven't needed any actual appointments for some time. I prefer to call the surgery but I'm happy that there are other options available to get appointments. Care is always good, staff are great and it all works well for me."
Reynard,Quick to be seen,10/27/2021,5,"Everything is good. Very quick to be seen and there are no issues, it's brilliant here. Staff are lovely, very polite and cheerful, nothing needs to change."
Reynard,Really great surgery,10/26/2021,5,They see you and will always fit you in if you have an issue and I'm really happy with the surgery its great.
Reynard,So far so good,3/30/2020,4,I am a new patient so cannot comment too much 'so far so good'.
Reynard,Staff are great,10/26/2021,5,Absolutely brilliant. I've always got appointments when I've needed them and have had great communication with the surgery since my hospital discharge. They've arranged for me to have a check up and xray and will see the doctor again in a few weeks.
Reynard,Staff are lovely and medical staff brilliant!,3/27/2020,5,Since I've had children they have always given priority to them. Getting access via the phone does take time. But the staff are lovely and the medical staff are brilliant. eConsult sounds a good idea.
Reynard,Staff friendly,1/23/2023,5,I tend to come up to the surgery to book appointments as its easier than getting through on the phone and I live very close by. Staff are very friendly when talking with them. I had a chat with a GP about getting my prescription done on a 3 monthly basis rather than monthly as its for a medication I'm on for life and this now happens. Since moving to the surgery I haven't had a face to face appointment with a doctor but all the telephone consultations I've had have been great.  The online prescription service works well as do the text reminders that come through
Reynard,Staff great,1/23/2023,5,"I can't complain about anything, they are always available when needed and the staff are always great. Its a good surgery."
Reynard,Support to myself and my family is excellent,10/21/2021,5,"We are new to this practice but cannot fault it. Disability welcome meeting with the GP was a good start. Nurse today was excellent with my [child]. 
we always get a pleasant welcome. 
now i have found the rear car park, parking is easier."
Reynard,Surgery can be flexible,3/30/2020,4,It can be a challenge to get an appointment but they can be flexible if people cancel appointments. I am interested to know about online and eConsult as an alternative to phoning the surgery.
Reynard,Ten years on.....,4/19/2023,5,"I moved to Lakenheath in 2011 and registered with The Reynard surgery. I worked in Red Lodge so it was an obvious move. My first encounter was when I found I had a low heartrate. The Doctor suggested having an ECG. I expected the appointment to be weeks ahead, but was told to come back in the afternoon!
This is the kind of service that is so rare now, that since I moved to Brandon in 2021, I still use the Reynard as I have complete confidence in all the staff and their facilities."
Reynard,The surgery is good,6/1/2022,4,I don't need many appointments with a clinician but my prescriptions are all done well and on time. I have no issues as anything that I've needed the practice to address has been done by staff quickly and efficiently.
Reynard,This surgery has improved over recent years,3/30/2020,4,"I feel this surgery has improved over recent years, reception staff are better now too. Overall I am happy with surgery but you do have to wait a long time on the telephone to get through to the surgery."
Reynard,Treated like an individual.,8/25/2019,5,Able to get an appointment easily. I've been at this surgery for 35 years and I feel I am treated like an individual.
Reynard,very efficient,8/25/2019,5,Very efficient here. I can get an appointment easily.I have diabetes and can get appointments to suit my lifestyle.
Reynard,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"Very good to get an appointment, I find it all works well for me. Staff are wonderful and really professional, its a brilliant surgery ofering great care."
Reynard,Very Good Surgery,3/30/2020,5,"It is a very good surgery, I like it here, I prefer this one to my last one, having a radio playing makes a difference to the atmosphere. I find making an appointment is fine its just getting through on the phone which is a challenge."
Reynard,Very happy with the service,1/25/2019,5,I use both here and Mildenhall (White House) depending on where I can get the first appointment. I'm not aware that I can book online which I think would be useful. Only gripe is that I can sometimes be 10-20 minutes late being called in but given the nature of of the demand I think that is understandable. Overall I would say that I am very happy with the medical service.
Reynard,Very thorough and informative,7/2/2019,5,"I have given high marks as I value this service but it isn't without issues. Getting an appointment is probably the main thing for me. It takes 3/4 weeks to get to see my doctor and a nurse practitioner appointment is about two weeks. Emergency on the day appointments are usually available if I am really poorly. My doctor is very thorough and informative, which is why I wait the 3/4 weeks rather than seeing someone else."
Reynard,"Very, very helpful",1/25/2019,5,"I don't come much at all for myself, I will usually be bringing one of my children in if I do come. I phone in for appointments because it is usually an 'on the day' need rather than a routine appointment. Reception are very, very helpful at fitting us in and doctor and nurse all seem to be very professional."
Reynard,Will try online booking,8/25/2019,4,"My experience is that I can hardly get an appointment when I call in. I will try online booking in future. There is one doctor who can be abrupt, rest of staff are lovely."
Reynard,Works well,1/30/2023,4,I tend to use econsult as it's easier to use however on this occasion the system suggested I call the surgery when I was completing it and I've been given an appointment with a GP when I spoke to reception.  All in all it works well and staff do their best to explain everything well.
Reynard,Would prefer blood tests here,8/25/2019,3,I need regular blood tests and sometimes it is difficult for me to get to the transport to Mildenhall or Newmarket. I would prefer it if I could get this done at the surgery.
Rookery,A bit frustrating,9/13/2021,4,It can be a little frustrating on the phone when you are trying to contact the surgery for an appointment as there are so many people calling the queue can be quite long.  I needed so cream following treatment at Addenbrookes but it needed the doctor and I had a nurses appointment. Rather than just coming to see me the nurse had to go back and forth and even took photos for them to see.
Rookery,A bit mixed,6/30/2023,4,My first experience of getting an appointment at the surgery was very good but  when I submitted an econsult later on I didn't get a response so today I've called. I then had a call back and have been invited in as I needed to be seen before they would do a fit note for me.  I wanted to leave a compliment online but the website seems to focus on complaints not compliments.
Rookery,A good surgery,7/3/2019,5,Staff are friendly and I've been able to see someone when needed. I do prefer to see a specific GP if I can for the issue I have and I've still been able to get an appointment with in the week.
Rookery,A good surgery,4/29/2022,5,"It works really well for me as I can get suitable appointments in a good time frame. Doctors are good and I don't have any issues with the practice at all. When we were away it was really helpful that the doctor arranged for a prescription to be sent to a different pharmacy so we could pick it up.  The pharmacy at the practice are also great, so helpful and friendly."
Rookery,A Real Family Practice,3/15/2018,5,I have been with the Practice for 8 years.I have been treated fairly and honestly.GP's are accessible to discuss health problems and concerns about Medication. Nurses and HCA's receptionist's are excellent as well.
Rookery,A very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"The receptionists are really helpful and my GP really understands me, I have a good relationship with them and it's nice to see someone who knows you. Having said that I'm also happy to see any of the GPs if its urgent, they are all good."
Rookery,Able to get face to face appointments,10/12/2021,4,Been able to get face to face appointments when I've needed them and it's generally been ok. I do feel that the face to face appointments are a little more limited but I've had referrals for tests and all of the issues that I've had have all been addressed.
Rookery,Accommodating staff,10/12/2021,5,I had a telephone consultation at the end of last week and the doctor wanted to see me but as I needed to arrange transport they accommodated this and gave me an appointment for after the weekend. Its as good as it can be and its a good surgery with helpful staff.
Rookery,Accomodating staff,8/19/2022,4,I was invited in for an annual review and needed to have a blood test before the appointment. The doctor has called to say I need to come in to discuss something and they'll do the review at the same time and they were able to book the appointment there and then.  I'm really happy to see any of the staff but do feel that reception is a barrier to getting an appointment. It's unclear how things work and why they are asking so many questions. I arrived to collect my medication two days early but they hadn't been prepared yet even though the prescription had been in for a while. I can't understand why they're not prepared in advance of them being picked up rather than at the last minute.  Staff were very good and got my medication ready the next day when we were going away.
Rookery,Always given time by my doctor,2/25/2020,4,"I am impressed with the quality of conversation with my doctor, I have never felt rushed and never fobbed off. I have been able to keep the consistency of the same GP which has been useful as I have recently been diagnosed with a new condition and the consistency has been helpful, I find that the ability to book my appointments on line means that I can maintain this consistency."
Rookery,Appointments good to get,8/19/2022,5,"Getting appointments has been fine, I went through the triage process and have now been given an appointment with a doctor. They are already running behind by nearly 1 hour which is a little frustrating but I'm happy to see any of the GPs as they are all good."
Rookery,Appointments tricky,3/1/2023,4,"Today was very good and I was given a  quick appointment but I've had difficulties in the past. They were very good with the Covid jabs, I'm immunosuppressed and had no problems.  When I was shielding I had regular blood tests done at home which was really good."
Rookery,Brilliant,9/13/2022,5,"All works very well. I've been in a few times recently and each time spoken to a GP and been given clear advice or an appointment. The consistency has helped with the issue 
I have and I've been given all the help I've needed. I do prefer to speak to someone on the phone rather than using econsult which in the past that has worked well too. Because I tend to get through on the phone to the surgery easily there isn't really a need to go online and use econsult."
Rookery,Busy surgery,6/30/2023,4,I've had no real issues getting appointments although I do hear from friends who have only been able to get phone calls. It is busier than it used to be and I do see different doctors.
Rookery,Can't fault the service,8/8/2018,5,"I can't fault the service that I get. Appointments are ok to get, receptionists are friendly and clinicians are good! I do worry how I would get out if the lift conked out while I was here (surgery is on 1st floor) but I suppose someone would rescue me!"
Rookery,Can't fault the surgery,6/7/2022,5,"I really can't fault the surgery staff and how they have cared for our family. Whenever I've called for advice or an appointment they've always called me back quickly and we've been seen by a nurse or a GP. We've had long and short term issues and all have been dealt with quickly, The only issue has been when you have an appointment and are prescribed medication the communication with the dispensary isn't always great. On one occasion I waited an hour with a toddler to find out they hadn't told me that the medication wasn't in stock. If they'd just thought of telling me that would've been fine and understandable but to wait that long and not be told isn't great. It could run a bit better as you do have to chase medication at times."
Rookery,Care is good,3/1/2023,4,"I mainly see the same GP but it can mean a bit of a longer wait to see them. Care here is very good and I get on really well with my doctor, its just getting to see them that is the issue."
Rookery,Care is great,4/29/2022,4,"When you do see a GP they are very good, so nice, but getting to see them is difficult. I called and then spoke to a GP who asked me to send pictures in but because I missed the call back as was at work I was then told I had to rebook  which would mean more of a delay.  Getting an appointment in advance is more difficult so I feel there are barriers to being seen. The nurses however, are excellent and so good at the care and treatment they provide."
Rookery,Children seen,10/12/2021,4,"Getting the children seen has not been a problem at all, they are dealt with quickly and the triage system works well as having the call back  allows you discuss the issues before coming in if its needed. The dispensary are very good at sorting out any issues that arise. Our son has a lot of medication and sometimes they need changing quickly and they do this well."
Rookery,Clinically it is fine.,1/26/2019,2,Lack of timeliness is the main issue for me. I am currently 45 minutes being called in today. My appointment was 9.30 and it is now 10.15. A routine appointment with my choice of doctor will take about three weeks but it would be sooner if I was happy with any doctor. Clinically it is fine though.
Rookery,Conflicting GP advice,2/25/2020,4,"I do not get good GP consistency which is disappointing, I see different doctors about the same thing and when one doctor says one thing and another doctor says something else it does not help with building trust."
Rookery,Delay today is exceptional,1/26/2019,4,"I am an hour late being called in, I will probably get a brief apology but it will be empty words, not a proper explanation. My appointment was 10.30, it is now 11.30, how can they be so late so early in the day? The delays are every time I come in though today the length is exceptional."
Rookery,Delighted they have a wheelchair,7/1/2019,4,Practice wheelchair: we are delighted that the practice has a wheelchair. Without it we probably couldn’t get here as it is on the first floor. That said the wheelchair does have one dodgy handle and one footrest is missing-I don’t like complaining but it isn’t really very safe. The practice overall is pretty good. My husband is on palliative care and we feel well supported.
Rookery,Difficult to get an appointment,9/22/2016,4,"My doctor is very good. I do find it difficult to get an appointment at times, if I want a specific doctor you can have to wait up to 3 weeks."
Rookery,Dispensary could be better,9/17/2019,4,"Sometimes the dispensary don't have the medication ready and that can be frustrating. 
A bell or just the acknowledge you are at the dispensary window would be better."
Rookery,Do get through in the end,9/13/2021,4,"There are quite long waits on the phone when trying to get through but you do get through in the end. I've waited for call backs and because you are not told when it is likely to be I have occasionally missed the call, it would be helpful if the Dr could leave a message to say they've called so you can call the back straight away. Other than that I'm happy with the care and treatment provided."
Rookery,Doctors are excellent,9/17/2019,4,"I do find the waiting on the phone to speak to the reception frustrating, I waited 16 minutes this morning and there is no music or message to give any indication where you are in the queue it just rings. 
The doctors here are excellent
I am quite happy with the surgery overall."
Rookery,Drs and nurses are all great,1/26/2019,4,The doctors and nurses are all great in my experience but a lack of timeliness is a real difficulty for me as I have to take time out of work to attend for an appointment.
Rookery,Drs are good,8/8/2018,3,"Getting an appointment can be difficult, currently we 'phone in' but I may take a look at the online booking. We are usually late being called in, 20 mins being average. According to the booking in screen today we were next to be seen when we booked in at 10.45 (for an 11.00 appointment). No one has come out and we are still waiting and it is now 11.05. That said, the Drs and treatment are very good once you get in to see them."
Rookery,Drs are very good.,8/8/2018,3,The Drs are very good though this is my first visit for three years. I got an appointment ok-I booked online which worked well for me. It is very warm in the waiting room but to be fair it is very hot outside.
Rookery,Drs. all pretty good,8/21/2018,4,The doctors I have seen have all been pretty good. They have always diagnosed me well and been able to offer treatment/solutions. Getting an appointment is the least good thing here. I wait two weeks for a routine appointment but that is partly because I choose to wait for a particular GP
Rookery,Easy to get appointment,9/11/2018,4,I've had a pre arranged appointment today so was asked to come in but I've found it easy to get appointments when needed. I'm confident that I see the right person for the condition and they have ensured that tests have been carried out quickly. I do feel at times it would be easier to have a chat face to face at times rather than on the phone but on the whole it works well.  Reception staff are very good and always happy.
Rookery,E-consult works well,3/1/2023,4,"I've found that e-consult works well with all issues being addressed well. I've also spoken to reception and have been given an appointment with a nurse straight away. Reception staff are friendly and helpful and, although the phones are busy, the staff are good and the care and treatment provided is great."
Rookery,Excellent,7/3/2017,5,They have listened to me very well and took action very quickly when I raised the issues I was facing
Rookery,Excellent,11/17/2016,5,"I write about the care given by doctors and delivery of my medicine each month to my house. In the past I have been a nurse, chiropodist and studied archaeology .  I am 81 years old with heart disease and require medicine to keep me well, which is delivered to me.  I would say to peope: listen to what your doctor says..
In my young days I nursed patients in the East Anglian hospitals.  We are lucky people because all the doctors and nurses are helpful to patients"
Rookery,Explain things well,10/12/2021,5,Getting an appointment with a nurse has been easy enough to do and my diabetic nurse explains everything very well and is brilliant. My prescriptions are always ready on time too.
Rookery,Fair but experienced lack of care,10/11/2016,3,"I had a cough for a few weeks - was told it was a virus and no treatment .  I suggested could go to chemist for some cough mixture.   The reply was yes go and get it if you feel it would improve things, that is what most people are doing these days.  
Not the response I expected at 80 years old"
Rookery,Fairly happy,10/12/2021,4,I've been fairly happy with how I've been able to get appointments. This time its not urgent so I'm not too worried about the time it has taken to get an appointment.
Rookery,Fantastic care,8/8/2018,4,I received fantastic care following my heart surgery at Papworth-they couldn't have done more for me. I can book double appointments when I need they. Really great.
Rookery,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,5,I've not been at the surgery long but registration went smoothly and I've found that the phone has been answered quickly when I've called. I've been triaged  and then given a choice about who to see. I have a follow up appointment with the same GP I saw last time which is great and has really helped. Staff have all been nice and friendly each time I've had contact with them.
Rookery,Generally I can get an appointment,9/17/2019,4,I can generally always get an appointment. Location of the surgery could be an issue with some elderly patients.
Rookery,Getting an appointment could be improved,9/17/2019,3,The waiting to get an appointment needs to improve. It is hit and miss with the times of getting an appointment.
Rookery,Getting in is the issue not the care,3/1/2023,3,Most of the contact I've had with the surgery has been by phone and I would prefer a fae to face appointment as I've found that issues aren't always addressed adequately with medication just handed out.  I've also had difficulties getting a specific medication as when it's needed I have to have a conversation with a GP but getting one can be difficult.
Rookery,Given choice,6/30/2023,5,"I called this morning, had a call back from a GP who invited me in for an appointment. I was given a choice of who I would prefer to see and I was happy with how the conversation went on the phone.  I've also used econsult in the past and that has worked really well when I needed to submit photos.  Even when I've called at 9.30 in the morning I've still been able to get an appointment the same day. It's definitely better now that when you call in you're in a queue and don't have to keep redialing."
Rookery,Good explanations for GP,9/17/2019,4,"I always get an appointment when I need one. I find it quick and helpful. Good explanations for GP.
Sometimes not all of the medications are ready for collection at the same time so I have to make another trip."
Rookery,Good overall,2/25/2020,4,"Not much to say other than my experience has been good overall here, no complaints."
Rookery,"Good surgery, dispensary could be more polite",9/17/2019,4,This is a good surgery but you can't get the same GP unless you are willing to wait 2 weeks plus. It would be better if the dispensary would acknowledge that you are waiting at the dispensary desk 'that's just being polite'.
Rookery,Good today,10/12/2021,4,"Today I've been through the phone triage and it's worked really well and I have been given an appointment straight away. Previous attempts to have an appointment haven't been as easy at times, I was asked to send photos and do an online appointment which just took longer than needed."
Rookery,Happy,10/12/2021,4,I'm happy with everything at the moment. The phone lines are busy but you do get through and get appointments when they are needed. Staff are also good at explaining things when you are talking to them. I had my booster vaccination at Mildenhall which was really well organised.
Rookery,Happy with doctors and nurses,4/29/2022,5,"I haven't needed many appointments but when I've had call backs they come back to me around the time suggested , which works well. I'm happy with the doctors and nurses and I feel that you see the most appropriate person for the issue you have. Until recently I wasn't aware that GP+ appointments are available or that there was another service offering cervical screening at different times of day. When I tried to book mine it took a while to get the appointment, I didn't know of the other service so just waited."
Rookery,Hard to get face to face,12/4/2022,3,"Hard to get appointments since Covid, mostly you talk on the phone with the GP but I find the appointments useless."
Rookery,Has worked well,9/13/2021,4,"The system to get appointments has worked well for me however, I would like to be given an appointment with a doctor as a matter of course rather than having a telephone chat before being able to see them if I am in pain. However, I am confident that if I spoke to reception I would get an appointment with a doctor if I needed one."
Rookery,Have always been great for my daughter and I,2/25/2020,5,"They have always been great with me and my daughter. However you can sometimes wait for up to one and a half hours at the appointment. Usually the medical treatment is very good here, but yesterday the doctor prescribed me the medication Codeine for pain without seeing me just from speaking with me, I have now needed to ring back today to see a doctor as I feel unwell, I'm not comfortable that the doctor prescribed medication without seeing me."
Rookery,I am happy with doctors and nurses overall,1/26/2019,4,"When I do come in I am virtually always late being called in and it can be up to 30 minutes.Nurses seem to run closer to time than doctors. I am happy with the doctors and nurses overall, it is a pretty good place. Because I have an ongoing condition I can always be seen pretty well straight away."
Rookery,I get frustrated,8/21/2018,2,The doctors are brilliant. Getting an appointment is difficult. I get frustrated at the long delays in being seen. I no longer have a named GP.
Rookery,I never have a problem getting an appointment,8/8/2018,4,"I have been registered here for 20 years or more, I used to go to the Molton branch when it was there. It was great when I had my babies. I've never had a problem getting an appointment here and the referrals to specialists is good. I am able to book with the same doctor all the time and I value the continuity."
Rookery,I wait regularly 30 mins+ at appointment,2/25/2020,4,"I have had a couple of issues but otherwise they have been overall good here. There were a couple of times that I waiting in the waiting area and they forgot about me, I think it was a communication issue at the time. I do wait regularly 30mins or more at appointment."
Rookery,I wouldn't change anything,6/18/2019,4,"I've been coming here for a long time and I am very pleased with this surgery, I wouldn't change anything."
Rookery,If anything I'd improve getting appointments,9/17/2019,3,"I think they are better with children treatment than adults. Appointments here are difficult to get sometimes, the doctor will ring back and today it worked fine but sometimes it's challenging. Face to face interaction with reception staff is better than on the phone. You can have to wait quite a while to get to see the doctors, up to 45 minutes sometimes. If I could change anything it would be to improve getting appointments."
Rookery,It is a really good practice,8/8/2018,4,"This is a really good practice. Really, really good with mental health problems. Couldn't have helped me more-I don't think I would be alive without them"
Rookery,It is good here,8/8/2018,5,I have been a patient for 40 years though part of that time I went to the Molton branch so now i am a bit older it isn't quite so easy to get here. It is good here-I phoned this morning and I have got an appointment for the same morning-you couldn't ask for much more than that!
Rookery,It's different at the moment,9/13/2021,4,I miss not being able to see a specific doctor and I find if difficult to know if something is urgent and whether I need to be seen more quickly.  Generally though I'm happy with the care given although I do feel its more difficult get an appointment now.
Rookery,Lady on phone I felt was rude,2/25/2020,4,"I felt the attitude of the person who answered the phone today was rude in her approach, I am a professional person myself and I would never talk to a patient like I was spoken to this morning. I saw the doctor and this aspect of the visit was very good and very thorough, once you get past the reception the surgery isn't at all bad. Unfortunately I end up talking about more things with the doctor than I probably am supposed to but that is mainly because it is so hard to get an appointment, if more appointments were made available I would not need to take a list to the doctor."
Rookery,Look after me very well.,8/21/2018,5,"They look after me very well. I have been registered here for 40 years. For instance, I had an appointment today and drove back from work allowing myself an hour for what ought to be a 40 minute journey. There was massive congestion because of an event at the race course so I was 40 minutes late but they were very understanding and are seeing me anyway."
Rookery,Looked after very well,6/30/2023,5,"I spoke to a nurse on the phone yesterday and was given an appointment for this morning which was great. The phones aren't too bad, you don't wait long and I've been able to get appointments when needed. Staff are very good, they explain issues very well and have been incredibly supportive."
Rookery,medics poorly prepared before consultation,9/17/2019,3,"Communication with chasing things can be quite frustrating, I was told 2 days ago that I was going to get a call back about my son's medication and I'm still waiting. I feel I am waiting at appointments too long - up to 30 minutes. I wish the medical professional could be a bit more prepared before I go into the consulting room as having to explain things that they already know is frustrating and can be insensitive."
Rookery,Minor surgery taking place again,9/13/2021,4,The surgery is absolutely fine. I was due to have treatment before covid hit and it was then stopped but I'm in today for minor surgery as the GP is now offering the service again and I've been seen quickly. At times it can feel difficult to get past reception to be able to get an in person appointment.
Rookery,More difficult in the past,3/1/2023,4,"In the past I've found it more difficult to get seen and have been asked to go to the pharmacy first. Today I spoke to a GP and was invited in for an appointment, I was happy with the discussion and pleased I'm now being seen. They are always very good to get the children seen.  On my last visit I was given an appointment but when I arrived I was told there was no record of the appointment but staff squeezed me in which was great. I have found that it can depend who you see to how you are treated, one doctor is dissmissive so I try to avoid them if at all possible."
Rookery,More than happy,4/29/2022,4,"I rang this morning and then spoke to a GP when they called me back, they then invited me down for an appointment. I'm more than happy with how the system is working and with how staff are with me, they explain issues well and are so helpful."
Rookery,My doctor is lovely and very understanding,8/8/2018,3,I am currently 35 minutes late being called in for my appointment so that's not so good as I have my young daughter with me and she is a good girl but becoming a bit restless now. I had a breakdown at work last 9 and I am still not right. My doctor is lovely and very understanding but I don't feel as if I am improving and I am still waiting for specialist care.
Rookery,My doctor is very good.,8/8/2018,5,The loo could do with an update-the sanitary wear is a bit jaded. We can be late being called in-in fact that is the norm but we value the extra time with the doctor when we need it so I guess you can't have it both ways. There is one individual doctor that we don't rate but the system allows us to book with one of the others except in an emergency
Rookery,Never any issues,8/19/2022,5,I called first thing and spoke to a doctor and someone else and was then invited in to see someone this morning. I don't know who I'll be seeing but feel its all worked really well today so very happy. Staff are great and I never have any issues.
Rookery,No issues,7/10/2018,4,"I really like that I can see the same doctor on a wednesday as they have a clinic. I really trust the doctor and I'm lucky that I can call and arrange appointments when they're needed. It would be nice if the website could be up to date around closure dates for holidays as I looked to see if the dispensary would be open and it implied it was, although I was surprised by this it was closed when I got here."
Rookery,No issues,10/12/2021,4,No long waits to be seen and the care is good
Rookery,No problems,4/29/2022,5,"I've had no problems getting appointments, either telephone calls or in person with a doctor and both have worked well.  The call backs can take a little time but they will always call. The nurses particularly are very good, very caring and will spend time with you."
Rookery,No problems getting seen,3/1/2023,5,"No problems getting seen especially for the children they are always seen when needed. On the day has worked ok with call backs happening quickly with in about 1/2 hr.  I spoke to the doctor and they have given me an appointment .  I'm happy to see any of the doctors, they are all good and have clearly read my notes before seeing me. I'm completely happy with the surgery and there are no problems getting seen."
Rookery,Not a bad surgery,3/1/2023,4,"Online econsult works well, especially when I'm working and can't take phone calls or wait on the phone.  For routine issues you have to call on the day which is difficult when I work an hour away from the surgery, it would be good if it was possible to book certain things ahead of time. I would also prefer it if the phone system had  a queue system as at least you'd know where you were in the queue.  Staff have always been great."
Rookery,Offered different appointments,4/29/2022,5,"I've had differing appointment styles and all have worked well for us as a family, they're with the appropriate member of staff who are always lovely and helpful. I really can't fault the practice as when we need advice and care we get it."
Rookery,Online appointments not always suitable,10/12/2021,3,It does appear there is a real reluctance to give face to face appointments with a GP. My mother has been given appointments which are then turned in to an online appointment which was not suitable for the issues she was experiencing. After explaining that this was not appropriate we have now been given a face to face appointment. It would've taken less time to just have a face to face in the first place.
Rookery,Online booking is pretty good,8/8/2018,4,The waiting room could do with updating and it is very warm during this hot spell. The receptionists can be a bit rude but this seems to be when they haven't got an appointment to suit. I realise they can't magically create vacant slots but maybe a bit more training on how to deal with people with a bit more empathy? I find some doctors more attentive to my symptoms than others so I only now book with the doctor who listens to me. The online booking system  is good but my preferred doctor isn't always on the online booking system so I sometimes have to 'phone in.
Rookery,Only offered phone calls,4/29/2022,4,I do feel that face to face appointments with a doctor should be more freely available as I've only been offered phone calls. They have sorted the issues out so I suppose it's not too much of a problem.
Rookery,Phone calls feel rushed,8/19/2022,2,"I do not like the phone consultations as you have limited time with the doctor on the phone and it often feels like they are trying to rush through it.  This then affects the care provided because things are done so quickly and there is no discussion. The lack of time spent on issues then means I have less confidence in the decisions.  If they are busy the attitude of staff is not always great and I think that is where you notice it on the phone.  I've submitted some paperwork for completion but it seems to be taking quite a long time to get it completed, already nearly 2 months."
Rookery,Phone consultations can be more problematic,8/19/2022,4,I do find at times the phone consultations are more problematic for me as I do not speak English as a first language but I do manage. When I have a face to face appointment it is easier. I was in hospital following an accident and they arranged for the surgery to contact me to arrange this appointment with a GP.  They called to let me know when to come in and it's worked well. I also find the NHS app works well.
Rookery,Phones are busy,10/12/2021,3,The phone lines are busy in the morning. I've been told that a doctor will call me back by a certain time but 4 hours later I've still been waiting. This is difficult as it means that I can't leave the house. I've been able to get a face to face appointment but it wasn't particularly easy to get.
Rookery,Polite staff,3/1/2023,5,The staff are polite when I speak to them on the phone and they have been able to give me an appointment starightaway which was great. It seems calmer now compared to the last time we came to the surgery.
Rookery,Rang Friday-got appointment for Monday,1/26/2019,5,I re-registered here last year after a seven year period living away from Newmarket. I rang last Friday and got an appointment today (Monday) which I consider pretty good. I’m not keen on the care navigation thing at reception though
Rookery,Really good,10/12/2021,4,"The surgery is really good, I did an econsult which advised I call the surgery, I did and have been given an appointment straight away. Most staff are lovely but on occasions have felt unsupported and not listened to."
Rookery,Reception staff appear to be under pressure,2/25/2020,3,"Sometimes waiting at appointment can be often up to an hour. The reception staff appear to be under pressure and their attitude can often be brisk with patients. I have celiac disease and I feel that I know my condition better than the doctors here, it would be helpful for them to have better understanding of the condition."
Rookery,Receptionist not being understanding,2/25/2020,4,I had a problem recently with a receptionist not being very understanding. I often have to wait up to an hour at the appointment which can be frustrating.There was an occasion when I really did not feel that the doctor understood me when I described my symptoms.
Rookery,Respiratory Nurse is Superb !,2/25/2020,3,"Toilets are very shabby and not what I would expect in a doctors surgery. I regularly wait at appointment 30-40 mins but have waited longer than that too. The nurse in the respiratory clinic is superb ! I did have an issue recently with a doctor not signing off one of my prescriptions in time for me to collect at Tesco pharmacy, I was so desperate that Tesco pharmacy had to lend me a tablet, I made a complaint to the surgery about this, as the surgery staff knew the urgency and they let me down on this occasion I felt."
Rookery,Sadly not very customer focused on the phone,2/25/2020,4,"I find the reception staff on the phone to be not very customer focused with their attitude, it almost feels like the moment the phone is picked up they are annoyed the way they answer it. The doctors I have seen I find are very good and their attitude a far more patient focused than the front desk. Unfortunately you can wait up to an hour or more at the appointment this can be frustrating. But if the reception staff was improved it would make things much better."
Rookery,Seems easier,6/30/2023,3,I don't use the surgery much but it does seem easier now as my more recent appointments have been face to face after speaking to a doctor on the phone about the issues.  I feel the waiting time on the phone is also better as there are times when it can be quite quick to get through. The last time I had an appointment I did get missed and ended up waiting an hour and a half nearly to be seen but that was a one off mistake.
Rookery,Sick notes only accessible here via online,2/25/2020,4,"I am able to get an appointment here as I need them, today they were able to fit me in as an emergency. I was frustrated earlier this year though, I had a scan on my shoulder and it was discovered that I had a tear and was told not to lift anything until healed. My work understandably said they needed a doctors note to verify and so I came to the surgery to ask the reception staff who were adamant that sick notes could only be sourced online now, this was very frustrating to me as I am not that good on the computer."
Rookery,sound in waiting area could be improved,9/17/2019,4,"I can usually get an appointment when I need one. I have seen the surgery expand and I like the triage system and they call back.
The sound system is not good in the waiting area for people who are hard of hearing."
Rookery,Specific doctor who I value and trust,1/26/2019,4,"I have waited two weeks for this appointment to see a specific doctor who I value and trust. I could have had a quicker appointment but no choice about who I would see. I never go in on time, I m 35 minutes late today. They don’t do blood tests here-have to go to community hospital."
Rookery,Staff are friendly and approachable,8/8/2018,4,"The staff are friendly and approachable but the waiting room could do with a bit of a makeover and air conditioning would be great just at the moment (during the abnormally long hot weather). There is usually a delay in being called in to be seen and today the Dr. apologised for the delay which I appreciated. Parking has to be paid for in advance and I get anxious if I am 40 mins late being called in that I might run over my parking time and get a ticket. I wouldn't want to get hung up on the delay thing though because I consider the medical care to be very, very good."
Rookery,Staff are good,4/29/2022,4,Staff are good and explain everything to me but I do find speaking on the phone difficult at times as I struggle to hear.
Rookery,Staff attitude on the phone is not up to mark,2/25/2020,4,"The staff who answer the phone are not always up to mark, when I speak over the phone the attitude could be much better. I have found some GP's are better than others with explaining and giving time to their patients, there is one doctor who holds the door with expectation for me to leave, I do feel rushed with that particular doctor, it can feel embarrassing at the time."
Rookery,Straight forward,8/19/2022,4,It's straight forward to get appointments and I've booked this one in advance. I do find discussing mental health and wellbeing issues on the phone difficult but after today's appointment and chat I feel in a much better place now.
Rookery,Superb,8/19/2022,5,"The whole surgery have been superb for my own health and care and that of another member of the family who has been given amazing mental health support, for which we are so grateful. I called this morning and I've been given an appointment with in hours of speaking to them."
Rookery,Surgery is fine,10/12/2021,4,"I have no real issues, there is a little bit of a wait on the phone and reception explained it may be a bit of a wait for a call back but I spoke to a GP quickly and was given an appointment for today. The surgery has always been pretty good."
Rookery,Surgery is fine overall,9/17/2019,4,The staff are lovely. Waiting at appointment time is variable. The surgery is fine overall.
Rookery,Surgery needs to grow,9/17/2019,4,"I can always get an appointment when I need one, and also for my daughter.
I find the staff to be helpful and professional.
If I could change anything I think more doctors would be helpful"
Rookery,Swamped with patients,2/25/2020,4,"Generally a good surgery but I have seen an increase in patients, they seem to be swamped with patients now ad the GP consistency could be much improved."
Rookery,Telephone triage is really good,1/26/2019,3,I am half an hour late (so far) being called in today. Last time I was in I waited 30 minutes with no one else in the waiting room! It makes things very difficult as I have to take time off work to come in. That said the telephone triage system is pretty good. When I need an appointment via this pathway I usually get an appointment within a couple of hours. Myself and my family have all come here for years.
Rookery,They are pretty good otherwise,1/26/2019,4,Being seen on time (not) is the big thing here. I also have to wait 2- weeks for a routine appointment with a specific doctor. All that said it is pretty good otherwise.
Rookery,Thorough and kind,9/17/2019,5,Thorough and kind. I find the staff always have enough time for you and they listen well which is good. The doctors are not over clinical in their communication which is helpful. If we need to be referred it happens quickly.
Rookery,Triage a bit drawn out,10/12/2021,4,The triage process is a bit drawn out but I did get  a call back from the doctor quite quickly and was then given an appointment today. I prefer this system to the one where care navigators asked me why I needed an appointment. I also like being able to ask to see someone specific at the surgery.
Rookery,Triage works,9/13/2021,5,The triage system works well and I can take calls at work which is good. The e consult service works really well for me as working shifts means I can't spend hours on the phone trying to call the surgery. I can write everything I need to say down and wait for the reply form the doctor.
Rookery,Triage works well,9/13/2022,4,"Been able to get appointments when needed and the triage has worked very well with a chat on the phone and follwed up with an appointment 1 week later. I'm happy to see any of the GPs.  I have a long term condition and it would be much better if I could get my medications every three months rather than every month but this isn't possible, it would surely cut down on the work for staff."
Rookery,Triage works well,4/29/2022,4,"I've not struggled to get appointments when I've needed them, it's all been good and there are no areas I feel the surgery need to improve but then I don't come in very often."
Rookery,Triage works well,4/29/2022,4,Triage works well but getting a face to face appointment has been difficult. In most cases I don't need to be seen but there are occasions when I feel I do need to come in and I do find this difficult at times as it's net seen as necessary. Staff generally are very good and overall the surgery are doing a good job.
Rookery,Triage works well,4/29/2022,5,"The triage process whereby you talk to a doctor first has worked really well today. I needed an emergency appointment so spoke with the GP nd they gave me an appointment, so its worked really well. The doctors take the time to explain issues well when you're talking to them to which is great."
Rookery,Very good,9/13/2022,5,A friendly surgery and it's been brilliant to get appointments. This is a pre arranged appointment with a doctor and is a follow up. The doctor I'm seeing is very nice and explains things so well. The surgery staff are flexible and offer a lovely personal service and I've never had any issues over the years.  The only thing I'd change is the bench seating in the waiting area and have a high armed and backed chair
Rookery,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"The surgery has been very good with me over the last year, so supportive. I can't fault them."
Rookery,Very good,8/19/2022,4,"The care provided is good, it's just you are asked to arrive on time and there is an emphasis that if you don't there will be consequences but if appointments run behind there is no apology or explanation."
Rookery,Very good,10/12/2021,5,"Very good to get appointments, most of mine are booked ahead of time which works well. Staff are great and explain things well and nothing really needs to change, it all works very well."
Rookery,Very good practice,6/11/2015,5,it can be a long wait to see the GP of ones choice but otherwise excellent
Rookery,Very happy,4/29/2022,4,"I spoke with a GP this morning and they've arranged an appointment which is great. I'm happy with how the conversation with the GP went and what will happen next. I do still worry that for non urgent issues you may have to wait quite a while to be seen.  My husband has had telephone calls that haven't always addressed the issues and have then required follow up calls, so it doesn't always save on time having a telephone call."
Rookery,Very kind and supportive,8/21/2018,5,I have some emotional issues. I get very stressed and anxious about any kind of social interaction and visiting the surgery is very difficult for me. I hate it! I must say that the nurses are all very kind and supportive. I don't think they could do any more to help me which makes it much easier.
Rookery,Very pleased,8/19/2022,5,"Since returning from abroad I've been very happy and pleased with the surgery as the process in place works well. You call, have a call back from a doctor and then they invite you in for an appointment if it's needed.  I've had health checks since being back and the staff have been great whenever I've spoken to them"
Rookery,Very satisfactory,7/1/2019,4,I have been registered here for a number of years and it meets many needs pretty well. I don’t have to wait too long for a routine appointment and the staff are a pretty cheerful lot. I haven’t ever felt that I had a medical need that they couldn’t sort out and my only gripe is that I can’t use the pharmacy.
Rookery,Waiting 2-3 weeks for a general appointment,2/25/2020,4,"I can sometimes wait up to an hour at the appointment, they say they are running late. I have to wait 2-3 weeks for a general appointment. Overall they have been a good surgery."
Rookery,Working well at the moment,9/13/2021,4,"The system is working well at the moment. I use econsult and that is great, makes it so much easier to contact the surgery when you're working. Language can be an issue but normally a family member attends with me to translate."
Rookery,Works well,3/1/2023,5,Happy with how quickly I got an appointment today and the care provided has been very good. Whenever I've needed the surgery its all been fine and works well.
Rookery,Would prefer continuity of GP,9/13/2021,4,"The majority of the time it all works very well but I would prefer continuity with a GP for longer term/ ongoing issues but for anything urgent I'm happy to see any of the GP's. I have had a few issues getting a sick note, I found the system in place confusing and seemed to make it more difficult than needed."
Rosedale,25 years at this surgery,6/10/2016,5,"For more than 25 years I have been a patient at this surgery and it has been a reliable and good service. Some new doctors need time to settle in, however.

Waiting times are not too bad, they have got worse over the years. Doctors are always happy to answer my questions and I have never had any problems with my care."
Rosedale,4 week wait,9/1/2019,3,Appointment system means that waiting to see same GP for an ongoing medical condition can take up to 4 weeks. I find this far too long and feel the surgery needs to think about how it can be better.
Rosedale,5 appointments later,11/12/2019,3,"I had 5 GP appointments and a trip to A&E before they got to the issue I had.
One GP was awful stating he does not need to examine and does not know why I am here. They just kept changing the medication.
I’ve now finally been referred for surgery as the 5th time I saw a GP here who really listened and had a student doctor in with her, so was likely to be trying to show vigilance. So this was much better.
I do not use the online system as I don’t use computer’s and they therefore talk me through things.
This whole experience wasted so much resource 5 appointments, 4 hours in A & E. 4 prescriptions. Thorough first time please."
Rosedale,A bit of a wait at appointments,7/3/2018,4,"This surgery is really good for its care. The only criticism is that it is quite a wait at appointments. I do not mind if you are informed and as it happens most of the time, you expect it."
Rosedale,Absolutely disgraceful,9/23/2020,1,New patient trying to get repeat prescription firstly sent it to old chemist now can’t get through on phone to sort it so I will have to go out to chemist
Rosedale,All good,9/1/2019,5,"May be I am lucky, but I am happy with the service here.  No they do not run on time, but who does?! I do not mind as I have nowhere to go."
Rosedale,All staff extremely helpful,10/31/2019,5,Each time I have been to the surgery always found it a good experience
Rosedale,Always been very good,3/29/2018,5,Surgery has always been very good. I get appointment when I need one and I find the staff respectful.
Rosedale,Always good when I need it,6/10/2016,5,"I do not have to go to the doctors very often but when I do I find the premises clean and the staff are very pleasant. I have been lucky getting appointments when I need them and they usually run on time.I feel that they seem to care how things are with me, which goes a long way with me."
Rosedale,Amazing,5/26/2022,5,I'm really impressed with the service you have provided for my father.  My sister and I have been doing our best to look after him. Everyone at the surgery has been very helpful and my father has been seen promptly on the day if needed and any queries I have sent in has been answered. Thank you so much for being a great practice.
Rosedale,Appalling waiting time of Lowestoft GP Centre,11/18/2019,1,"I have tried to call this place around 8:30 am till now 10:17 am, still their number engaged! It's very bad practice as this is the 4th time I have experienced this issue with Rosedale Surgery. Since this area doesn't have any walk-in centre also, I would imagine CQC need to evaluate all these matters before they do their next inspection and rate for the GP surgery!!!!"
Rosedale,Appoinments and waiting times are long,6/5/2018,4,To get an appointment is difficult. I called and spoke to my GP who got me in with him but still 3 weeks later.
Rosedale,Appointment booking is lacklustre,8/1/2018,3,Access to appointments has become more difficult.
Rosedale,Appointment within a few days,4/11/2021,5,I cannot fault the surgery. I called a few days ago and they gave me this appointment today. They also called me recently for my Covid booster which was really good and I am having it next week. Very efficient.
Rosedale,Appointments are difficult to get,3/22/2018,4,Appointments are difficult to get and even then do not run on time.
Rosedale,Brilliant staff and excellent treatment,3/29/2018,5,"The receptionists and nurses were brilliant. I attended Rosedale twice a week, for four months. Treatment couldn't have been better. Only thing wrong - when referred to ulcer clinic - I heard nothing - still haven't. Leg is ok now though."
Rosedale,Cannot fault it here,4/11/2021,4,I had a phone call from the GP this morning about something separately and just here to have a dressing done. I find they are very thorough and I cannot fault it here.
Rosedale,Cannot fault them,3/5/2023,5,"I cannot fault them as they saw me after a fall I had. I had my Blood pressure done, which was concerning. I got home and they called me back to see a 'health care professional'. Not sure what that actually means. I was asked to come in again and saw them. Everything they explained could have been done over the telephone as they then ordered a Blood test which is why I am back again today. This is 3 appointments in a very short time. I cannot fault how thorough they are, but felt all of this could have been assessed at the first appointment if I had seen the right person."
Rosedale,Cannot go to Crestview,7/3/2019,3,"Sometimes I am asked to go to Crestview with the children and this for me is near on impossible, just depends if I can get a lift with relative. So availability of appointments at my local surgery is the issue."
Rosedale,Change in meds with no assessment,3/5/2023,3,"This is an excellent surgery usually, although very difficult to see a GP.
With ongoing respiratory issues I have ended up calling the ambulance as the sudden change in my medication did not 'hit the spot'. I was given blue inhalers instead of ventolin). There was no assessment for this change and it was not working. 
They have reversed it now and I am back on the ventolin."
Rosedale,Consistently good,9/1/2019,5,Can always get an appointment when I need one.  Been here many years and found it consistently good.
Rosedale,Contact,10/13/2020,1,"In attempting to contact the surgery on behalf of an elderly friend, I am frustrated by the fact, apparently you do not answer your phone. My friend has no landline or internet access, consequently he asks me to make contact with his requests ( generally wanting a phone call from his doctor.) This simple task is complicated by the fact I am not him , the start page is artfully concealed and is not easy to find , it doesn't remember who I am so we have to go through the same rigmarole as to whether or not I have Covid symptoms ( I am still not him remember ! ) Once I am through with the iform I get a response which I need to submit his dob ( which I don't know, so I  made up the first time I did this) I know he (via me ) requests frequent contact, but this is a symptom of his malaise. It is almost as,though, in some perverse way you have made it impossible to contact you - that can't be right , can it ?"
Rosedale,Coordinating my care issue,3/5/2023,3,"Now 3 appointments on due to issue at the first one.
I booked bloods and a 'procedure' but at the first appointment they had not got me on the system and they tried to fit me in for the 'procedure', but I was sure I needed bloods first and as they could not do that, they made appointment for the next day could only do the bloods and so back again today for the 'procedure.'
The communication to coordinate this was clearly an issue and has meant 3 days on the trot needing to take time off work.
I prefer to use online system, but it keeps getting shut down."
Rosedale,Delay in seeing own GP,3/4/2019,4,"Everything goes OK. Staff are nice etc. I just wish it didn't take 3 weeks to see my own GP. I have had an issue come back that I am worried about and waiting 3 weeks I feel is just not great. On the day I do not expect to see own GP. A week, I feel, is reasonable."
Rosedale,Didn’t get a chance to see a doctor,2/26/2019,1,"I called up to book an appointment for a swollen throat. Took a day off work to see a doctor as it had come out of nowhere and a colleague had recently been in work with tonsillitis. The receptionist advised me to see a pharmacist. Now i did use the f word when describing how redicilous this was and she took offence. But i apologised and she never changed her tone and repeated ‘you woke up with a sore throat’ as if im a child who has no idea at what point it is appropriate to call a doctor. Considering i havent actually needed to see a doctor since this new system has come about i decided to take a trip to see a pharmacist hoping she could help but she just as unimpressed by the fact that i had been advise to see her over a doctor. 
Absolute joke."
Rosedale,Didn't help,2/2/2018,1,Twice been doctors with my baby no help or advice given went away with no knowledge of what can help them. Long waiting time and long wait on phones. Such a shame
Rosedale,Different site for bloods,1/12/2021,5,I have been sent to Kirkley Mill today by Rosedale as I missed my last blood test appointment. They got me in quicker than they would have had I only been able to go to Rosedale or the hospital.
Rosedale,Difficult appointments;Exceptional staff,3/29/2018,5,"The appointments never run on time and always difficult to get me in the first place. As a patient it is quite stressful. However, once you get to see the staff / GP, they are all exceptional."
Rosedale,Difficult to get appointment,10/29/2018,3,"I just find it very difficult to get appointments.  When I really need to see a GP it just does not happen. I get to see a nurse sometimes, but never a GP."
Rosedale,Difficult to hear,3/30/2023,4,"Once I get through on the telephone I tend to get appointment in a couple of days. My main problem, due to hearing loss is hearing them properly on the phone and at the appointment. Once my hearing gets worse, I do not know how they will engage with me, writing everything down, seems silly though. I struggle now with things enough."
Rosedale,Difficult to see own GP,7/3/2019,5,"In comparison to friends and relatives who are at other surgeries in Lowestoft I feel I am quite lucky at this surgery.  The only thing I wish could happen, is that I see my own GP when I need the continuity."
Rosedale,Don't rely on telephone consultations,5/25/2022,2,"I would advise patients not to rely on this practice's use of telephone consultations, that is unless you have nothing better to do than wait by the phone all day.  Some of us have to work and fit appointments around it but as far as this practice is concerned, that's not an option.  In my case the GP never did call in the morning as promised and by the time he/she did I was at work and couldn't take call - as they knew ahead of time.   It means not being able to renew my prescription and having to wait until another appointment's available at least a few weeks away.   Of course they're busy and need to prioritise urgent cases but if they can't call in the booked time slot then at least have the courtesy to send a text message or email or a quick call from the admin team to say they're running late and give us options to either rebook or wait instead of being kept in suspense all day.  We are human beings, not numbers!"
Rosedale,Duty of care neglected,7/9/2021,1,I’ve been trying for months to get a face to face appointment to address my severe pain and anxiety issues this practice has failed to address my problem with an injured knee correctly I’ve been told things that just are not fact I was told I’d been referred by a physiotherapist when I’ve never actually seen one this is just one example my anxiety levels are increasingly high with huge panic attacks but I STILL can not get a face to face appoinment
Rosedale,"Easy to get appointment, long wait on the day",11/20/2019,4,"Was easy to get an appointment, but waiting time way too long . Waited over an hour beyond my 10am appointment.
Very clean."
Rosedale,Emergency appointment,7/3/2018,5,"My son was bitten by a dog and I called in immediately is did not know if they would see us, but they said to bring him straight in. We waited a few minutes and I realised the time was near to when I needed to pick my other children up from school which was only a 10 minute round trip. I spoke to reception and they said they would hold my place in the queue. After we got back from the school we were seen within 5 minutes and they were excellent. I was just so please to access something locally rather than have to try and get to hospital, as that would have been less immediate and logistically difficult as I do not drive."
Rosedale,Everyone lovely,3/5/2023,4,"Everyone here is really lovely, from reception to any medical staff you may see.
I am not keen on the smear test though as it is always so painful and I know it should not be. It makes me feel like I do not want to come for it anymore, and now I am older I will discuss it with them."
Rosedale,Excellent although delays in booking appointments,11/20/2017,5,The service is busier than it used to be due to other surgeries closing.  It can take a whiie to get through for an appointment.
Rosedale,Excellent but getting an appointment is annoying,11/24/2016,5,The only thing I get annoyed about is trying to get an appointment
Rosedale,Excellent but hard to get appointments now,11/20/2017,5,Trying to get an appointment is difficult.  It has got worse since other surgeries have closed in the area
Rosedale,Excellent level of care from our Drs.,8/12/2021,5,"I would like to recommend to all patients that they use the website method of asking for help/appointments. It takes all the stress out of trying to get through by phone.  You can take time to explain your symptoms and requirements without blocking up the surgery phone lines. The dr can then see at a glance what help you need.  Since we have been doing this, we have had quick response and always accessed the help we need.  
The whole medical system is under great pressure atm.  I recommend to anyone to use the website to get the help you need and help make their job easier in these hard times.  Thank you to all at Rosedale Surgery."
Rosedale,Excellent service,8/3/2019,5,"This is an excellent service.  Moved here from Alexander Road when moved and within a day of registering I was in hospital, but surgery had all my information.  Had the paramedic out from the surgery who was excellent and 5 days later my own GP rang me to see how I was.  I got my stoma related prescriptions dealt with in timely manner and delivered quickly by the company supplier Coloplast.  So pleased I moved as things were much more difficult at Alexander Road."
Rosedale,Excellent Surgery,6/26/2023,5,"Reception staff are professional and very helpful. All clinical staff are very knowledgeable, I always feel at ease and reassured if I ever have to visit."
Rosedale,Fair but hard getting appointments now,11/20/2017,3,Access to appointments has become more difficult
Rosedale,fantastic receptionists helpful at all times,1/27/2021,5,EACH TIME i CALLED THE RECEPTIONIST WAS HELPFUL KIND AND ALWAYS GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE CARED. MEDICAL STAFF EQUALLY GOOD WHEN SEEN.
Rosedale,Feel fortunate to see someone,7/3/2018,5,We are all aware of pressures on the services. I feel fortunate to be at a surgery that sees you on the day if absolutely necessary.
Rosedale,Find it very good,11/12/2019,5,We do not wait too long of need to see GP (about 2 weeks). They keep a good check on my diabetes and seeing the diabetic nurse at the surgery is very convenient.
Rosedale,Find the surgery excellent.,12/20/2019,5,"When I've needed a rare ""on the day"" appointment I've got one, but mainly I've needed advanced appointments with midwife, and it's been very good."
Rosedale,FootFall on-line system is easy to use,4/11/2021,5,Really good service. I use FootFall and find it easy and they are very responsive.  I work in the NHS so know what we are all up against and so fully appreciate all they do here.
Rosedale,Friendly & helpful most of the time,7/12/2020,4,They call back when they say they will in good time & the ladies on the front desk are pleasant
Rosedale,Friendly and caring GP,9/1/2019,5,I really like my registered Doctor.  He is the friendliest and most caring Doctor I have ever met.  He's helped me and my children numerous times and I feel like he's always there to hear my problems.
Rosedale,Good,10/11/2018,4,"Have visited this Surgery over the last few years and have always felt I have received good treatment from the Doctors and staff.
Whenever I have felt I needed to see a doctor quickly the receptionist have arranged an appointment or a telephone call with a GP.
I would like to also mention the lady in the prescription office she is excellent at sorting out any problems one might have with tablets.
We are lucky to have such a wonderful practice with good caring staff in this very difficult time for the NHS."
Rosedale,Good,11/20/2017,4,Always helpful and caring
Rosedale,Good,8/14/2017,4,Called ill.  Said to get to doctors within 2 hours (symptoms sickness and non-eating) I had gastro-enteritis
Rosedale,Good access today,9/1/2019,5,I 'phoned at 2 pm for an appointment for a chest infection.  I am being treated for T. Cell Lymphoma and they were very good to offer me an appointment at 3.30 pm. Thank you
Rosedale,Good appointment availability,3/4/2019,4,"Able to arrange appointments when needed, same day or in advance."
Rosedale,Good service,3/4/2019,4,"Getting through on the day can take quite a while (5 minutes today*) so I walked in but was put on the list for the 'call back' and GP called me and gave me appointment for today. I think the 'call back' is excellent.

*HWS CDO explained that a 5 minute wait although it feels long to the patient in comparison to surgeries elsewhere this is very quick. Patient was then more pleased to know that it is not as bad as they thought."
Rosedale,Good service but runs late,3/4/2019,4,Really good service but runs a bit late
Rosedale,Good surgery overall when I need it,7/3/2018,4,"There is delays in the waiting room, especially in the afternoon where you get a lot of families."
Rosedale,Good team here,3/4/2019,5,Good team here
Rosedale,Got appointment on the day,9/1/2019,5,"Here with my child and I got an appointment on the day. A little late but only by 10 minutes, so acceptable.  Found the surgery suits out needs and appointment system works well as we get to see someone when we need to."
Rosedale,Great before using the current system,7/27/2021,1,"It has always been easy to book appointments and message the GP prior to the new NHS app and Airmid. The website is confusing and difficult to navigated and you can’t book appointments to suit your diary, GP’s don’t get back to you, waiting times for urgent things are long, and repeats takes longer than usual too.  Receptionist said also are not particularly friendly. If I wasn’t so happy with my particular GP at the practice I would have left."
Rosedale,Great support in a difficult time,6/10/2016,4,My husband died last month after living with Alzheimer's since 2012. The support and understanding from the GP during this difficult time was much appreciated
Rosedale,Hard to see someone on the day,7/3/2018,4,"It is quite difficult to get through and get an appointment. I am not a regular user of the surgery, so I do call only as a necessity, and it is annoying that I am questioned over it."
Rosedale,Having a problem getting anything done,3/4/2019,2,"I have an on going problem since beginning of January and have a problem getting anything done. Walk in team not helpful - takes two weeks to see a doctor although in pain and off work. Taken a week to talk to doctor on the phone for advice, 4 weeks to see a physio. Had to go private still in pain and off work. Will be changing surgery soon."
Rosedale,Helpful and efficient,1/4/2019,5,Always friendly helpful and attentive. Easy to get appointments and repeat prescriptions.
Rosedale,I do get to see GP,7/3/2018,5,"I always have been able to see a GP when I need one. My own GP booked this appointment in for though, but I would not normally get to see my own. The continuity I think is important."
Rosedale,I have had good service for over 20 years,1/17/2022,5,I have never had a bad experience from anyone in this practice
Rosedale,I have moved to another,7/3/2018,4,My son comes to this surgery still but I have moved to another as I get anxious waiting so long for the appointments when you arrive
Rosedale,I have never had any issues with this surgery,12/20/2019,5,"I needed a prescription, but got a phone call after I put in the request to offer me an appointment on the same day. Very good."
Rosedale,I needed to see a GP for depressive symptoms,9/18/2019,5,I was able to see a GP the same day & she was lovely. She listened to me & helped facilitate my recovery - despite the 10-minute consultation period each patient has - I felt very looked after. Thank-you
Rosedale,It is crazy one cannot get through by phone,4/26/2021,1,You phone and are put in a queue with 17 or more others and then wait up to an hour before you get somebody to answer the phone. It is not very good service.
Rosedale,Lack of continuity with doctors,6/27/2017,3,I find not seeing the same doctor difficult
Rosedale,Long wait for routine appointments,3/4/2019,4,If possible appointment in general could be a bit sooner. (Routine appointment currently about 3 weeks wait)
Rosedale,Mainly good service,7/3/2019,4,"Apart from running a bit late the surgery, I find overall, good.  Can get appointment when need one, which for me is mainly what you need out of your surgery.  It is a free service under pressure, so feel people need to be more realistic about what they get from it."
Rosedale,Mixed experience here,4/11/2021,3,"I have had mixed experience throughout this year. Early part of the year I ended up after a couple of calls seeing Nurse Practitioner who said she'd get the GP in as they were needed, but she returned without one and I was then left worrying. Turned into wrong diagnosis and medication that 3 months later the GP changed when I finally did get to see one.  But positively I found a lump and immediately I was referred for mammogram and turned out to be a cyst but that was all very efficient.  Today my appointment with GP is through Footfall that was made 2 weeks ago. This time I am pleased that the 'system' worked as gave me what I thought I needed."
Rosedale,Mostly very good,11/24/2016,5,Usually very good.  Sometimes difficult to see a certain doctor
Rosedale,Need more flexability,7/3/2019,3,"You need more flexibility than just 'on the day' only as an option, it is ridiculous.  Had GP say to me to tell reception that I need a follow up in 7 days and to book it with them.  Reception then said I had to call on that day.  It is clear that the 'Left hand does not know what the right hand is doing'."
Rosedale,New patient,9/1/2019,5,"As a new patient from a surgery that was closing, I have found so far that the treatment and care are very good."
Rosedale,No emergency equals 2-3 week wait.,7/3/2018,4,"Surgery has been very good. If you don't say it an 'emergency' though, it can be 2-3 weeks before you see someone. You get asked extra questions now too, which I find difficult. I consider 'emergency' to be a 999 call"
Rosedale,No faults,7/3/2018,5,This surgery is excellent. I cannot fault it.
Rosedale,No follow up,4/11/2021,3,"Had some blood tests and been told they are ok by reception. I asked if I could have a copy of them and was told I have to write a request for them and can take up to 28 days. If seeing the GP they just print them off there and then, so I find it a bit ridiculous. Also, where is the follow up? What next after these being ok as there is still something wrong???"
Rosedale,Not amused,8/15/2018,1,"My appointment was cancelled but when I arrived there, the receptionist said I didn't have an appointment.
It seemed that the ear syringe was not working so the appointment was cancelled. I asked if they could refer me to another surgery but they would not."
Rosedale,Not what it used to be,6/10/2016,4,"The standard of the premises' cleanliness is not perfect but of acceptable standard. I find the staff pleasant on the occasions I have visited. Waiting times to get an appointment are pretty long, which is ok in some situations, but when I am feeling terribly ill I find it distressing trying to convince anyone that I need an appointment urgently."
Rosedale,Nurse can't be bothered to call you  back,10/25/2018,1,I'm a lorry driver working away all week. Phoned about holiday vaccinations. Nurse can't b bothered call back it's been 4 days. Absolute patient disgrace.
Rosedale,Ok but issue with a prescribing,11/24/2016,3,"On the whole quite ok.  Dr. called out, no prescription for one whole day! Dr. called to home.  Said he had prescribed for mother but when we called it had not happened.  They were important as she had an urine infection issue. It got sorted out in the end."
Rosedale,Ongoing good care,11/12/2019,5,Not in very often but I honestly feel this surgery looks after my needs very well. I find the reception team polite and helpful. I didn’t know about ‘Footfall’ so I will now definitely look at that.
Rosedale,Online system very good,11/12/2019,5,"I use the system for my repeat prescriptions, and it works very well. I have had to have much more regular blood tests of late here to get my warfarin right, as my ‘level ‘ was far too high when I was at James Paget having my check up (heart related)."
Rosedale,Overall very good,11/24/2016,4,If I needed an urgent appointment they are very good at getting a doctor to see me but to see my own doctor I can have a 2/3 week wait unless I'm lucky.  Overal I think they do a very good job for my care
Rosedale,Overall very good,6/6/2016,4,"Just like everyone else I speak to, it is difficult to get an appointment when you need one. When you get the care, it is very good."
Rosedale,"Polite, efficient and caring",1/3/2019,5,"Both my wife and I have been ill recently.  The receptionists were very pleasant and caring.  We always got appointments on the same day, and on two occasions within an hour.  The doctors were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble"
Rosedale,poor service,12/31/2019,1,very poor service - can never get a doctor's appointment. Apart from one doctor the others are very poor in
Rosedale,Poor service going around in circles,7/8/2021,1,Trying to book an appointment is a nightmare. The practice fills out a form for you over the phone. You send photos in to be triaged and you do not hear anything for days. I sent an email just to be told did I fill in a form online. Why is this process so hard for people just to see a GP? I understand Covid etc but this is not an excuse for poor service. Please sort out your booking system for a GP!!
Rosedale,position of sign in desk is not great,3/4/2019,4,"I would make the suggestion that the sign in screen needs to be elsewhere as it's position right where you see reception is far too close, for privacy purposes."
Rosedale,Progressing with my condition.,12/20/2019,5,"Feeling like I am getting somewhere with my condition since moving to this surgery.
Although I see different people, they know where I am at."
Rosedale,Quick response and good advice,1/27/2021,5,"I requested support via the online form, this was answered very quickly. The nurse practitioner was very helpful and gave sound advice, which she followed up by calling me back. Very supportive throughout."
Rosedale,Quiet,3/4/2019,4,"New here as moved into the area recently. Got appointment today for blood tests easily. In comparison to London, this place is extremely quiet."
Rosedale,"Quiet, calm atmosphere",12/20/2019,5,"Private settings and very friendly staff. Can always get an appointment at a convenient time.
Good link to pharmacy."
Rosedale,Really happy,9/1/2019,5,"I am only able to say that I am very happy with the service, as I get appointments when I need them, but I do rarely use the service."
Rosedale,Really Professional Practice,9/28/2022,5,"Recently attended for joint flu/Covid booster injections.

The booking process was online. We were contacted with appointments less than a half hour after enquiring. 

We were in the surgery for less than 10 minutes. A very efficient process.  All staff were really friendly. 

Both injections were well done. I hate needles. The nurse was brilliant.  I didn't feel it, although arms were mildly stiff later.

This appointment,  like all others I've had, was very well run by professional staff.

Very impressed. 

Thank you."
Rosedale,"Reception staff,  untrained,  obstructive",3/27/2019,1,"Unable to obtain appointment to see nurse until registered,  so I registered,  then told unable to make appointment as will not be on their system for five days!!!!!!"
Rosedale,Receptionists are poor,9/20/2019,1,"Ordered something my partner had before on repeat prescription and not done after a week had to go in and chase them up! District nurse changed my partners prescription took new item in to receptionists showed them they wrote down all details this was last 13/ 9/19 went in today NO PRESCRIPTION,NO RECORD OF ME BEING IN THERE!!! VERY POOR RECEPTIONISTS"
Rosedale,Receptionists not helpful,11/15/2019,1,Receptionists not helpful!!
Rosedale,Registering for online services complicated,11/23/2020,2,"I have tries previously to register for Rosedale Surgery Carlton Colville online services but failed. I now see you can upload proof of identity I.e. A driving license which is great but once you have submitted all your details the system tells you to present identification to the surgery to obtain a code?  This is daft, bureaucratic in the extreme and unnecessary, how for goodness sake are OAP's supposed to deal with a system such as this? Also the website is cluttered complicated and not easy to navigate."
Rosedale,Running late,9/1/2019,3,"This surgery is always running late.  It is 30 minutes today.  If you are given an appointment you expect to be seen within a reasonable amount of time of that appointment.  If you operate a 'drop-in' waiting is fine, as there is no expectation. Maybe they should consider this."
Rosedale,Saw us straight away,7/3/2018,5,"This surgery has been consistently good. You can sometimes wait a bit on the telephone to get an appointment, but the majority of the time once you get through you can be seen on the day if necessary."
Rosedale,"Seeing my own GP, long wait for appointment",11/20/2019,3,"Booked this appointment three and a half weeks ago, and it is 30mins behind. Was quite confusing as I received 2 texts with different times on as my reminder for it. I am seeing the GP of my choice, which is probably why it took much longer to get the appointment."
Rosedale,Sees her dedicated GP,9/1/2019,4,"My mum who I care for is here and she gets seen by a dedicated GP every time, as she insists on it and they are very good at ensuring that happens.  It does however mean there is a longer waiting, which she does not mind.  It is explained that the demand means there then is a longer wait."
Rosedale,Speedy appointments,3/4/2019,5,Phoned on the day for my little girl and they got me in quickly. Very happy.
Rosedale,Staff are lovely,6/28/2022,4,"The staff at this surgery are always welcoming and helpful. There can be a wait at your appointment and you are informed of this when you check in, although it is not always accurate. Mine said 10 minutes and it has been 20 so far."
Rosedale,Takes ages to get appointment,7/3/2019,4,"You have to wait ages to get an appointment, as of course there are many people trying to ring at the same time in the morning. But that is the time you are told to call.  I did eventually after 4 days of trying, get through after being in the queue for a good 20 minutes.  Then when I am here currently, they are 30 minutes behind time. It is just a frustrating process."
Rosedale,The surgery seems to have got better,12/20/2019,4,"I do not use it much, but have got appointment today when needed.
It always feels nice and clean and staff are lovely."
Rosedale,Too easy for the practice to refuse treatment,2/8/2021,2,I am finding Rosedale surgery stand offish and impersonal. I am being regarded as a number not a person in need of treatment and the correct medications. And if trying to ring up I will be 6 foot under before I got through.
Rosedale,Too long wait for appointments,10/18/2018,3,"I have recently had problems with high BP and palpitations.  On trying to see the Dr, every time I phone or call in for an appointment I am told its around three weeks to see someone.  If I push for a quicker appointment I am booked to see a nurse.  Although they are very competent and check my problems they then say I have to see a Dr which means rebooking again!  The only alternative is to ring for an ""emergency appointment"" on the day.  This is a ludicrous situation as although I wouldn't class my problem as an emergency, I would like to have this attended to within a couple of days.
A further example on this system has been my recent palpitations.  I had a 24 hour ecg at the hospital on 10th/11th 9.  Was told the results would be back at the surgery within a couple of weeks.  I rang in two weeks to be told the results were back and normal.  As I was still having the problem I asked to see a GP in the next few days. Was told next available appointment was three weeks ahead.  No other option but to ring the next day and got emergency appointment.  Saw GP who said that my results were not even back!  After several more enquiries I was told my results are now back and they would contact me when the Dr had looked at them.  I receive a voice mail to say ring the surgery.  I return the call to say the ecg was normal but if still having palpitations I could book a ring back appointment.  I said I was still having them so the receptionist booked the next appointment for a Dr to ring me.  This is 5th November (more than two weeks from today).  All this waiting increases my palpitations!"
Rosedale,Total care,7/1/2019,1,"Doctors at this surgery thinks its acceptable for the receptionist to give me my blood results over the phone change my medication and talk about my medical conditions is ok! even though I explained  changing my medication at this time would leave me in pain!  not offering me a phone call from the doctor till 17th of Jan or face to face till the 27th Jan, I find this totally unacceptable and rather disappointing that this could happen!"
Rosedale,Unbelievably poor service,7/11/2019,1,I live 3 hours away from the surgery and have been trying to arrange tests for my elderly mother- this has proved something that this practice is incapable or as I suspect not interested in arranging- despite waiting weeks for a call or indeed an email I have today been sarcastically advised to arrange the mental assessment and the blood tests myself - absolutely disgusting service
Rosedale,Understanding,4/15/2020,5,"I am delighted to recommend the doctors and staff of this surgery. They are calm, welcoming, understanding and caring."
Rosedale,Very efficient using FootFall on-line system,4/11/2021,5,I used FootFall this morning and they rang me within an hour to see me. Really easy to use and very efficient.  Seeing the GP today after that.
Rosedale,Very good,11/17/2016,5,On the whole they are very good.  If you phone on the day and it's very important they will try to see you on the day
Rosedale,Very good experience,2/13/2021,5,It was very friendly and efficient
Rosedale,Very good experience,12/2/2021,5,It was very friendly and efficient
Rosedale,Very good service overall.,12/20/2019,3,Need a bit more time as older and need more explaining.
Rosedale,Very good surgery,4/11/2021,5,The surgery is very good. Have had good continued support for me and my family as we go though cancer treatment at Norfolk and Norwich. I put a online form in this morning and we were given an appointment straight away. System works brilliant. My only issue can be our prescriptions.
Rosedale,Very helpful and understanding,1/29/2021,5,"Some people in the medical profession do not seem to listen to what you are saying, but both Dr the pharmacist have listened to what I have to say and have been most understanding and endeavoured to help with our problems."
Rosedale,Very positive - lucky to have this surgery,12/10/2018,5,"I have visited several times over the past 3 years and have been seen by 3 doctors (when mine was away for some reason). All have listened and considered carefully before recommending treatment which I believe has been the best for me. I go away feeling cared for and properly advised. The surgery is professionally and positive and seems to be constantly monitored serve patients needs and comfort. There is plenty of parking, a pharmacy is on site and the surgery close to shops, including a supermarket. We are very lucky to have such a good surgery in town, with good regular doctors and excellent administration."
Rosedale,Very Sympathetic Doctors,9/1/2019,5,Very Sympathetic Doctors and Nurses here.  But it is difficult to get appointment with a Named Doctor.  You do not know who you are seeing until you are called.  So this means in turn that they are not so up to date with medical history.
Rosedale,Very thorough and I trust them,3/4/2019,5,I came to the surgery twice a week to get leg dressed. Nurses know me very well and are lovely. They 'keep an eye' on me. I had a bad cough and they demanded that I stay and see a doctor. The COPD nurse saw me and then I saw a GP. Had steroid and antibiotics. Very thorough and I trust them.
Rosedale,Waiting times getting longer,11/20/2019,3,On previous visits explanation has been poor. Waiting times seem to have got longer. I recognise pressures but appointment times should be kept to as best as possible. Would be good to be told why if 10-15mins behind.
Rosedale,Young doctor I saw was lovely.,7/9/2018,3,Well whilst asked to sit in the corridor whilst my prescription is printed. I heard two members of staff slagging the Doctors and the surgery off. Using swear words.
Saxmundham,1 hour behind at 10 am,12/14/2018,3,"How at 10 am can a GP be 1 hour behind?  With a small child it is difficult to keep them occupied.  No point asking reception why they are late, as you get a brusk response and it doesn't change anything."
Saxmundham,All fine for me,12/14/2018,5,"I know there are issues here, but I take them all on board, as the surgery is doing all they can.  I am retired so do not worry about how long I have to wait.  I understand others in a different situation will feel differently."
Saxmundham,All very good.,11/3/2016,5,All very good.
Saxmundham,Always get to see someone,8/23/2018,5,"Whenever I have needed to see someone on the day or 'in an emergency', as they call it, I always have been able to. I cannot fault the service at all."
Saxmundham,Approachable staff,12/14/2018,5,"Friendly and approachable staff. The Waiting room is comfortable and so are the treatment rooms.  It can depend where you sit though.  The chairs that are back to back do knock each other, so you can get an annoying nudge in the back."
Saxmundham,Asthma assessment,9/14/2018,3,"The appointment today is a pre-booked one for my assessment on asthma, so I got sent that.  In general the surgery is very good and most of the time you can get an appointment if urgent, on the day.
Really running behind though. This is quite normal for the surgery though."
Saxmundham,Be nice to communicate why running late,8/23/2018,5,"The surgery overall is excellent. The one thing I would ask, is if appointments are running more than 15-20 minutes behind, that patients are informed. I have sat for an hour in the past and had to ask them as I thought I had been overlooked. They are all lovely staff though and do tell you, but only if you ask, which often you feel awkward in doing."
Saxmundham,Brilliant surgery. Always very helpful.,8/13/2019,5,"Wonderful, caring, knowledgeable staff who always help as much as they can despite being under intense pressure."
Saxmundham,Can run behind,8/23/2018,4,"Overall the service is good, but can run behind on the day. I do understand, but it would be good to know that this is the case."
Saxmundham,Can't get an appointment,8/19/2020,3,You are just met with excuses
Saxmundham,Can't get an appointment with 'my' GP.,2/10/2019,4,"I don't use the GP that much: with MS I tend to go via my MS Nurse. But if I do want to see a GP, it's nigh on impossible to get an appointment with 'my' GP. Continuity of care from same person would be nice. Flipside of this is that you get different viewpoints, not just from one person's opinion or experience."
Saxmundham,"Caring, professional",10/24/2021,5,"Fortunate to have been looked after by Sax Health, efficient, dedicated and professional staff.  [...] impressed all by smooth, fuss-free covid vaccination programme."
Saxmundham,Concern for future of the surgery,4/25/2018,4,Overall this surgery is good. Getting appointments can be an issue on the day some times but in the main ok. The future of the surgery my be different as I can see it becoming overrun due to new houses in the area.
Saxmundham,Concerned,11/16/2020,2,"Visited the surgery this evening for my flu vaccine. 
I noticed that the GP was not changing his PPE or washing his hands in between patients.  Slightly concerned as we are in a pandemic."
Saxmundham,Continuity would be nice,8/23/2018,3,"I would like to have continuity of seeing out GP. Calling on the day and being told I have 'no chance of seeing my GP so try in the afternoon, though you have next to no chance then either', by the staff member on the end of the phone, is very frustrating. also always told we can only talk about 1 thing when that 1 thing doesn't take up the whole allocated time. When I did see the GP and told them I was told to only discuss 1 thing with them, they said I can talk about another too. So being told one thing by one person and different by another is quite annoying and unprofessional."
Saxmundham,Could work on their communication,12/14/2018,4,"The surgery needs to communicate with patients better.  There are mixed messages. They spend money on expansion, yet the surgery is still overrun, so spending that money has made no difference.  The carpark is full of people who are not here, or they are hear waiting too long so instead of 1 car you get 4 due to the lateness of the appointments."
Saxmundham,Currently a 4-5 week wait.,12/1/2017,4,"Currently a 4-5 week wait to see a specific doctor but emergency ones are available.  Online prescription ordering is really great, you can see which ones are needed and whether its been ordered or being processed.  The pharmacy has been really helpful if anything has gone wrong and aways checked that the medication doesn't run out"
Saxmundham,Diabetic service excellent,4/25/2018,5,"Always can see GP when I need to. My blood tests that I have 6 monthly are made in advance. I get to see the diabetic nurse at the same time of the results and I speak to the GP too.
I also use the footcare service in Aldeburgh which is very good too."
Saxmundham,Didn't feel listened to.,4/25/2018,4,"The surgery staff didn't really listen when I was struggling with symptoms, and they kept guessing but never referring me to an appropriate service to get a diagnosis. I self-referred to physio, who I saw in May 2017 and after seeing 3 different people I finally got a hospital referral and a diagnosis. This was almost a year later. Very frustrating for me."
Saxmundham,Difficult to Park,12/14/2018,3,"There is a clear need to look at the carpark situation.  I have been here when there are barely any patients in, but the carpark is full.  A camera and a sign stating it is for patients only would be helpful I think.  A good deterrent. 
Appointments are running very behind today.  It is normal for them to be about 20-30 mins late, but today it is longer than that, which also impacts the parking."
Saxmundham,Difficult to see the same doctor twice,6/9/2016,4,Difficult to see the same doctor twice. eg. on last 3 occasions have not been able to see my nominated doctor
Saxmundham,Difficult to see the same Dr,6/9/2016,3,Difficult to see the same doctor in reasonable time
Saxmundham,Difficulty in making appointments,9/10/2020,1,They have a very negative approach when you attempt to make an appointment with a doctor. This has been a long time before the pandemic. They do not do blood tests nor take blood pressure as they have now stopped annual  health checks (In my case a 3 yearly health check). The reception staff has a tendency to be neither courteous nor terribly helpful. Doctors don’t seem to stay there long! Not a good nhs service.
Saxmundham,Dodgy technology but good patient care,3/4/2019,5,"Today I am here for my regular diabetes check. They are running behind, however the nurse has come out and told me she hasn't forgotten me, but her computer is playing up so she will come out and get me when it's done. Only took another couple of minutes and she came back to get me."
Saxmundham,"efficient, explanatory and friendly",9/2/2021,4,"There is only triage by phone available at the moment. However, the doctor took time to explain what the pain I experience in appropriate detail and suggested self referral - let me know that we can self refer  to a physiotherapist.  The physio quickly emailed me with some exercises."
Saxmundham,Everything is fine for me.,6/9/2016,5,"I do not use the surgery very much.  When I do need it, everything is fine for me."
Saxmundham,Excellent,8/23/2018,5,This surgery has always been excellent and take care of all my needs.
Saxmundham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Continual good service
Saxmundham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,good overall
Saxmundham,Excellent access to nurse practitioners,8/9/2016,5,Excellent access to nurse practitioners.  They go to doctors if necessary.  Make appointments easier
Saxmundham,Excellent care,12/16/2020,5,"I have recently registered with the practice and have had a recurrence of a long-term illness. I was treated very promptly, with kindness and compassion from everyone. Thank you, Saxmundham Health."
Saxmundham,excellent with an issue,6/14/2016,5,slow to get an appointment
Saxmundham,Excellent.,6/19/2019,5,Seen the same day as request for an appointment. The paramedic and doctor were thorough and clear in the examination and explanations they gave. The treatment worked.
Saxmundham,Facilities are limited,12/14/2018,4,The impact of appointments running over time means you end up with more people in the surgery and therefore the carpark than need be.  Spaces are very narrow and hard to get out of my car as I am elderly and need to open the door fully.
Saxmundham,fair,6/21/2016,3,Always a long wait but not the fault of the doctors but the lack of surgeries
Saxmundham,Fair but long waiting times and no toys/books,3/20/2017,3,When I need to bring my chidren it is difficult waiting for ages past my appointment time as they want something occupy them.  They used to have some toys and books but that all seems to have gone
Saxmundham,Fair but service is struggling,3/20/2017,3,This service is obviously struggling.  They need to put money into expanding it or have another one in the town with more houses being built.  Waiting at a booked appointment is always more than half an hour
Saxmundham,Fair but very long waiting times,3/20/2017,3,My appointment last week ran almost an hour late.  It's hard to know whether to stay sometimes as I have children that need picking up from childcare
Saxmundham,Fast and friendly practice..,10/30/2019,4,I have had cause to call twice recently and both times I have been seen on the same day and had a fast and friendly service... Excellent thanks!
Saxmundham,Fast friendly service,12/20/2021,5,I need regular prescriptions and sometimes I need extra medication. Whenever I place a prescription request it is dealt with quickly and with understanding; staff know the surgery procedures well and take time and care to ensure that I understand what needs to be done and how long it will take. They always make sure I get my medication in time. Staff are always happy anad friendly and I feel very comfortable contacting them and asking questions
Saxmundham,Faultless Covid vaccine delivery,12/20/2021,5,"For all 3 doses it was very well organised, I was contacted very promptly and an appointment made to suit me. There was no waiting, all went smoothly, staff were informative and everyone was cheerful.  (name removed) was present on all 3 occasions which were Sundays. I couldn't have asked for more."
Saxmundham,Find it hard to see the same Dr,6/9/2016,2,Just find it hard as I need to see same doctor due to my ongoing bad health. Frustrating to try and get appointment
Saxmundham,First class,11/3/2016,5,"My Doctor is first class, only problem is the long wait."
Saxmundham,Friendly,12/14/2018,4,"I find that the surgery has a friendly approach.  All staff are kind to me and welcoming.  I get appointments, but they are advanced ones rather than on the day."
Saxmundham,Friendly & professional,2/5/2020,5,"I am a new patient that joined the surgery just before the lockdown and major covid outbreak. It was simple and very easy to join the surgery and have my records transferred from my original doctors surgery. I am on regular medication monthly and this has been an easy transfer and continuation of supply with no issues. this surgery has a dispensary within the surgery so when you put a prescription in online, when you go to the doctors to normally collect just the prescription paper you can just pick up the medication, cutting out the middle man and an additional waiting stage.

the staff are all friendly in despite the difficult situation they are currently facing. All the staff remain very helpful and informative providing a professional and friendly service."
Saxmundham,Generally good,3/4/2019,4,Apart from taking 15 minutes to even get through to reception to get an emergency doctors appointment my overall experience within the surgery is really good.
Saxmundham,Generally good but staff under pressure,3/4/2019,4,Generally very good service but surgery and staff seem under pressure. Sometimes feel like they don't have time to deal with things properly or feel like it's an inconvenience. Regular dispensary delays means multiple repeat trips.
Saxmundham,Generally good.,11/3/2016,4,Most GP's seem to only be available for part of the week. Good service if you don't mind which doctor you see otherwise a 3 week wait on average. However all GP's are very good.
Saxmundham,Get appointments but always run late,2/5/2019,4,Get appointments OK. They just run way behind at appointments.
Saxmundham,Good,7/3/2017,4,Generally the doctors are very good and will spend time with you and listen to what you have to say.  Getting an appointment with your won doctor is very difficult.  I'v just tried to get an appointment and the first one I was offered was 6 weeks ahead.  I will now try to see another doctor.  If you need a doctor on the day they will fit you in
Saxmundham,good,1/19/2016,4,Luckily I do not need to attend very much.  Have a lot of respect for the surgery
Saxmundham,good - appointment slow,6/14/2016,4,getting appointment very slow
Saxmundham,Good care,2/5/2019,3,Nothing but good care here. However getting an appointment and then waiting in surgery for that appointment can be a bit extreme.
Saxmundham,Good coordinating of one visit,4/25/2018,4,When I get my letter for my annual diabetes check. I make my blood test appointment in time linking it to also seeing the diabetic nurse which for me makes a difference. It is good to be here once for the same service.
Saxmundham,good intentions but under resourced,5/15/2018,2,"They generally have the best intentions, however they regularly lose referrals, or simply are operating beyind their knowledge base, and do not know when to refer to specialist. Or maybe do not want to risk being told off they are spending too much on ""unnecessary"" referrals. Either way, they are causing more harm by ignoring both people with specialist chronic conditions and people needing specialist referrals. It's short term thinking to close the tap like this. If it's because they need CPD that again is a cost thing. They need to buy time and training to improve their care. Well intentioned and most staff very empathetic. With more resources, they could be really excellent."
Saxmundham,Good overall,12/14/2018,5,"The surgery when you come, is clean, the staff are polite and the Doctors/Nurses are excellent.  Getting the appointment and waiting at the appointment are the issues.  They are now dealing with more and more patients due to the expansion in population.  They are doing the best they can in the circumstances.  I try to do my bit, and only come when I absolutely need to."
Saxmundham,Good overall,7/16/2015,4,"Whilst the surgery is good overall, my only issue is the wait you have at your appointment.  Today things are running 30 minutes late. As I am an anxious person, I find this difficult. No one tells you and it would help me if when I check in it said it is running behind by '?' minutes. I could then prepare myself better/take a breather outside"
Saxmundham,Good service,3/4/2019,5,Always quick to deal with any questions I need answering and never have to wait to long for my appointments.
Saxmundham,Happy with service,5/29/2015,5,"Staff always treat me well, I can get an appointment when I need one and as quickly as I would like."
Saxmundham,Horrendous waiting times,5/8/2015,4,The appointment system needs changing. Non urgent appointments  should be after emergency morning ones.
Saxmundham,I can come along and wait if I like,4/25/2018,5,"The Surgery does give me the option to come along and sit and wait if so wish. I have done that, and it can mean waiting a while, but I do always get to see a GP, and I only do this when absolutely necessary."
Saxmundham,I prefer to see a dr not talk down the phone,6/9/2016,5,I prefer face to face not being telephoned for medication issues.  The toilets need updating
Saxmundham,Kind and Helpful,4/25/2018,5,"When I have need to use the surgery, which is not very often, I have always found everyone to be on top of their game, kind and helpful. Can not ask for much more really."
Saxmundham,Lack of communication via Reception/Doctors,7/2/2020,3,"I was advised to call Dispensary @8.30 (which I did, on the dot) to speak to (name removed). I was placed on a phone message that went on for 18 minutes... Why give the advise to call @8.30. When there is clearly no one there in Dispensary to answer the phone? Update: I waited 20 minutes for someone to answer my call (there was a meeting, and they couldn’t answer, they explained. Why wasn’t I advised the day before to call (name removed) at home where she is working? I’m sorry, but communication is the only irritating issue I find wrong with the practice. And that’s easy to work on."
Saxmundham,Late going in today,12/14/2018,4,"Getting appointments takes weeks and then you wait more than 30 minutes on the day you come.  No communication about why this is, as the surgery opens at 8 am and this is only 10 am."
Saxmundham,Long Wait,7/19/2016,4,GP surgery long wait for appointments.
Saxmundham,Long wait for telephone to be answered,3/4/2019,4,Phoned for appointment. Had to wait 18 minutes before anyone to speak to.
Saxmundham,Lovely people,12/14/2018,5,We find everyone helpful and cheerful. We just find the surgery overrun which makes getting to see a GP difficult.
Saxmundham,Medication changed,9/14/2018,4,"Since moving here I would like to have a medication review. I am on numerous tablets, yet some have been changed without really talking to me. The surgery itself is excellent in the circumstances and I am concerned by further houses are going up."
Saxmundham,Medication delays so use another place,9/14/2018,3,"We have started getting medication from 'Pharmacy 2U' as the prescriptions were taking too long when we put them in at the CO-OP. More than 5 days. (Healthwatch team explained the GP surgery is aware of this and patient can query it direct with the surgery as they are ensuring that they are sticking to the timescales that they have to for the CO-OP)
Patient response - They just know they had to wait too long and had to find a solution. It would also be difficult to put in the repeat at the Surgery instead of the CO-OP and then pick up from the CO-OP and that is why they choose to use the service."
Saxmundham,Monitor could tell us if running late,9/14/2018,4,"It would be good to know if the GP/Nurses are running late.  Perhaps using the screen or the 'check-in' monitor to say time wise or how may people are in front of you would be a good idea, if it has that facility."
Saxmundham,Monthly medication amid COVID unaffected,11/25/2020,5,"Due to ongoing health issues, l need monthly prescriptions which have always been very efficient before COVID happened - now in the middle of the pandemic - it is exactly the same - wonderful service with a smile. Yearly checks to monitor my health are now done by telephone, which is easier for both parties."
Saxmundham,More local chiropodists,7/10/2015,5,Wish their were more local chiropodists we are only recommended one at moment.
Saxmundham,Never had any problems here,2/5/2019,5,"Never had any problems here. I expect things to run late, but feel a service under pressure needs understanding from patients."
Saxmundham,"No choice, so impact high",12/14/2018,4,"As there is only one surgery, there is no choice for people other than to access this surgery.  Many houses have gone up, however although the surgery has expanded I am unsure if any new GPs/nurses have joined the staff.  What shows me that this is unlikely is the amount of time it takes to get an appointment, and the waiting time when you are here.
It is a difficult situation."
Saxmundham,Online system not great though,12/14/2018,5,"The online system showed the next date for appointments was December 31st but when you click on it there was no appointments.  This however was far too far away so I had to call in instead.  I managed to get a cancellation. It is running 20 minutes late so far today for me.
If they want more people to sign up to online system, there needs to be more on there."
Saxmundham,Only one worry.,11/3/2016,5,My only one worry is the number of new houses being constructed locally and the difficulty we may have seeing our own doctor fairly speedily.
Saxmundham,Overall happy,5/18/2015,4,"Having a high level of cholesterol, prescribed statins, however, no follow up check or appointment ever offered unless I request one.  Surely it should be routine to be offered a 6 monthly or annual check up.  Otherwise very happy with care from the surgery."
Saxmundham,Overall just average,12/14/2018,3,"Staff are fine and everything is pretty average.  However, waiting in the surgery is regularly more than 30 minutes, which I can do nothing about, but it does bother me."
Saxmundham,Overall this is good,12/20/2018,4,"I find the surgery mixed in my experience. Sometimes you wait 10 minutes past your appointment, which is ok, but more than 20 minutes is pretty bad.  I was in at 10 am and it is more than 30 minutes today, yet no one tells you this is the case when you turn up."
Saxmundham,Phlebotomist,12/14/2018,4,"A good service that I find much more convenient.  I think that maybe one day could be allocated to drop-in's for short notice need, rather than having to travel to the hospital. Running a bit late today, which is unusual."
Saxmundham,poor,9/30/2019,2,Child had 3 ear infections that they have diagnosed.  He has had many more that they said are viruses.  When he has had 6 in a year they will pursue it further. I know as a Mum that each time he has an ear infection they refuse to diagnose more.  His balance is affected.
Saxmundham,poor,9/30/2019,1,"Saxmundham Health, refused antibiotics for a lung infection, knew from a previous pneumonia scar. Having the antibiotics refused many times caused the infection to linger. As a spirometer test came back fine the treatment kept being refused. In the end got antibiotics and it finally cleared up. Felt like not being listened to."
Saxmundham,Quality of care,12/14/2018,5,"I always receive the best quality of care, support and discretion.  Always polite etc.  Could do with more nurses and doctors as waiting list to see my own doctor is normally 3 + weeks.  By this time its too late. I only like to see my own doctors as he knows my problem best of all."
Saxmundham,Quite happy with surgery,12/14/2018,3,I am quite happy with surgery.  My GP fits me in but takes quite a while to get to see them.
Saxmundham,Reception,12/14/2018,2,I felt that my concerns were not taken seriously and not given proper advice from the Doctor.
Saxmundham,Refused a GP appointment,12/14/2018,4,"When I had a reaction to a change of medication that my GP had made, reception refused to give an appointment to me, saying I had to see a pharmacist.  All they did was to recommend stopping the tablet and then to see the GP again.  It took another month to get to see the GP.
The message in the surgery says 'you will NEVER be refused a GP appointment'. Well that just is not true!"
Saxmundham,Repeat medication for elderly,8/23/2018,4,"This Surgery is good, but needs to think about how they help patients who struggle with their memory and their need to put in their repeat medication. I support a 90 year old who runs out of tablets because they forget to put in their repeat prescriptions. I have had to try and get it in an emergency and the pharmacy gets annoyed. So they should be thinking of a way to help this work better. surely it would be a 'win, win'."
Saxmundham,Rude staff! and waiting around...,8/21/2019,2,I had to wait for an appointment for over 40 minutes and other people that arrived whilst i waited were getting called in. Some of the staff are very rude! and was told certain things would take place on a day which did not happen not happy with there service! If anything they completely messed me around! made me very unhappy
Saxmundham,Running late,12/14/2018,4,"Running about 20 minutes behind so far.  I am in for a blood test today, but I expect it to be late.  We have become used to it.
All very good, and they look after me with my multiple issues."
Saxmundham,"Staff not interested in patients, pharmacy",5/17/2019,1,"Dispensary staff not interested in welfare of patients, refuse to issue medication, day need to get from a pharmacy even when told pharmacy does not have any, 45 minute delay while waiting to see doctor still not been able to get my medication and now the surgery have lost the new prescription that the doctor wrote, the staff should be replaced asap"
Saxmundham,Stopped the service,1/24/2019,3,"I went to book my next appointment for ear syringing and was told they were no longer doing it.  I was given a choice - pay £60 and attend the Hearing care centre clinic at Framfield, or just keep trying to clear it myself with the oil. I have a friend who is still offered this service in her surgery.  Feels like a post code lottery.  It is unfair to withdraw something without notice when another place does still offer it."
Saxmundham,Take the time to listen,6/9/2016,5,Very happy with my surgery.  Lovely doctors who take time to listen to you.
Saxmundham,There is a lack of variety in appointments,6/5/2018,2,My partner needed an appointment and he had to either go in that day or in 3 weeks
Saxmundham,"They are busy and rushed, little time to care",9/10/2019,3,"Very difficult to access appointments. Parking can be difficult too, as it's so busy. When you see medical staff they are great but have less time to care and you feel rushed."
Saxmundham,Too many patients,6/15/2016,1,Children - good.  Adults- awful.  Stack them high. no personal touch.  Too many clients lead to poor service
Saxmundham,Treated Well,7/10/2015,5,"Treated very well, kindly and patiently"
Saxmundham,unable to book appointment,6/7/2016,1,"6 is apparently fully booked (current date 7th 6); and not yet taking bookings for July.
Only option is to phone for an appointment on the day saying it's urgent"
Saxmundham,Uncaring and not interested,8/17/2019,1,"Not concerned with the reason for I’ll health, just the symptoms.  No feeling of caring."
Saxmundham,Useless,9/18/2020,1,"Every visit is nearly poor I feel like a broken record how many times do I have to say I have no email or Internet (have borrowed someone's phone to post this on my behalf) cause you may listen then 
Not everyone wants to make appointment by email or order there meds via email I certainly don't and won't. As for phoning to get appointment, receptionist acts like a doctor and wants to know what's wrong and I feel that there deciding my fate when that's for the gp to decide not someone sitting on reception even though I say it's personal; so much for confidentiality between a doctor and their patient. I will be registering at another surgery as I feel this is wrong. 
Have only had one good experience with one member of staff, the only one I see smiling every time I'm at the surgery and I would rather deal with her than anyone else at the surgery as she took the time to find out what was going on for me."
Saxmundham,Very pleased with the NHS services here,6/19/2015,5,"Since moving here nine years ago, my husband and myself have been very pleased with the NHS services here. 
Hospitals.
Dentists.
Doctors.
Clinics."
Saxmundham,Very professional,10/1/2020,5,"Friday afternoon - a long queue of people waiting for the dispensary.
Clearly they were under-staffed for whatever reason- but a woman at the front of the queue who was determined to ensure that the whole of the waiting room should hear that she was “very important” and that she was unhappy.  Despite being reassured repeatedly that everything was being and indeed had been done to ensure her prescription would be sorted, the lady continued to berate the member of staff quite unnecessarily.  The member of staff was a consummate professional; remained calm and helpful and managed to keep the rest of the queue happy whilst also managing the reception desk.    Well done.  You deserve a huge vote of thanks from the Practice Manager - and I speak as a former Director of one of Suffolk’s Health Trusts ."
Saxmundham,Very thorough,4/25/2018,4,I am pleased today as I have rang up this morning and got an appointment immediately. So I am very pleased with the service up until this point.
Saxmundham,Waiting an hour today,12/14/2018,3,I waited 20 minutes on the telephone to get an appointment and had to wait a long time when I arrived ( 1 hour). Floor in the waiting room looks quite dirty.
Saxmundham,Waiting at appointment half an hour,9/14/2018,4,"You can be waiting at an appointment for half and hour. Today I am in for a blood test, this was booked very quickly, which is not always the case, but very good this time around."
Saxmundham,Waiting nearly 4 weeks,12/14/2018,4,I have had to wait almost 4 weeks to get an appointment to see our own Doctor.  Then on the day having to wait from 30 minutes onward past appointment time is ridiculous
Saxmundham,waiting times are frustrating,6/9/2016,5,Waiting times for an appointment can be frustrating but under the circumstances (re new houses) the surgery does very well.
Saxmundham,Wonderful Modern Surgery & Dedicated Staff,4/22/2020,5,Not one specific experience. A multiple of experiences and needs catered for at all times with first class attentive care and explanation.
Shotley,A bit muddled at the moment,1/8/2022,4,It feels a bit muddled at the moment. I dropped off a sample but it was sent off with the wrong paperwork so I've had to come in again to re do it which has delayed things a bit. I understand that a lot of staff are new and they normally very good but it is noticable at the moment that things aren't as they usually are. Normally it's brilliant to get appointments but this does seem to be a bit more difficult in the last month too.
Shotley,A good surgery,1/8/2022,4,It's a good surgery generally but I've had issues on two occasions with my prescriptions going missing from the box. Quite often you get to the box to put yours in and someone else's is sticking out the top which isn't great.
Shotley,Able to book an appointment,11/25/2022,4,I called to arrange an appointment with a nurse earlier in the week and after speaking to reception they arranged one for today which was with a good timeframe. Staff explain issues very well but mental health support is now more limited since the loss of the GP who used to see me.  I try not to use any online systems if I can help it.
Shotley,Amazing staff,5/12/2018,5,"Such a great surgery, staff are amazingly good, they explain things so well and take you seriously. The care is very good and there is nothing they could do better."
Shotley,Amazingly quick,11/25/2022,5,It's amazing how quickly you can get an appointment here. I called this morning and have been given an appointment with a doctor. I've never had any issues here and referral and care provided by staff have been great.
Shotley,Appointment availability,1/8/2022,4,"There are times when I have called the surgery that I've been cut off by the system when calling first thing. Appointment availability is a bit of an issue when trying to see a doctor. I had a review booked but it had to be rearranged, which was fine, but when I came for the appointment I should've had a blood sample taken but the appointment had been booked too late in the day for that to be done. This  meant that I had to arrange another appointment to do them, again having to call the surgery and go through the process again."
Shotley,Appointment changed by the surgery,4/29/2015,2,I had an appointment to see the doctor about my leg but the receptionist called and asked me to move the time which I did. But when I turned up the doctor only wanted to talk about Alzheimer's and said to book another appointment next week for my leg. The appointment was done in such a way that it just made me worry more rather than addressing my leg problem.
Shotley,Appreciate home visits,4/29/2015,4,For most of my appointments I go to the surgery however when I was really unwell my doctor came out to me and did a house visit. The nurses also do my monthly blood tests at home and they are lovely.
Shotley,Booked an appointment easily,11/25/2022,5,I called first thing and spoke to reception who were very helpful and they arranged an appointment for me to see a doctor within hours.  From this experience it is working well and I've been able to get seen when needed. The staff are lovely and so helpful when you need to speak to them.
Shotley,Can't fault them,5/12/2018,5,"Really can't fault the surgery. You can always get appointments when you need them, it can take more time to see a specific GP but generally if you need to be seen you will be seen on the day."
Shotley,Care very good,5/12/2018,5,"The nurses come out to me at home which is great, the care and advice is very good and I really appreciate them visiting, especially to do my blood tests. Overall its a very good surgery."
Shotley,Excellent although there is one doctor I don't want to see,9/21/2017,5,A very good surgery; very pleased with the care we've received.  There is one doctor who I'd prefer not to see but it's not a big problem
Shotley,Excellent and easy to get appointments,9/21/2017,5,Excellent surgery.  Everything works well; can get appointments when needed and can go to either surgery and see the doctor I prefer
Shotley,Excellent and nice staff.,1/8/2017,5,Nice people.  Listen to you and what you have to say.  Always see same GP.
Shotley,Excellent and really like online booking,9/21/2017,5,Really like the online booking and being able to order prescriptions as well.  A good surgery
Shotley,Excellent but hard to get to. Staff very good,9/21/2017,5,Like having the two surgeries.  I do find getting to the surgery difficult as I rely on other people but the reception staff are very accommodating and helpful and make sure I can get appointments when I have access to transport.  Care is very good.  I see the same GP most of the time.
Shotley,Excellent. Always get appointments and like 'phone consultations,9/21/2017,5,Always able to get appointments when required.  Really like the telephone consultations as getting to the surgery is difficult for me.  It saves time for the doctors
Shotley,Excellent. Friendly staff and easy to get appointments,9/21/2017,5,"Generally a very good surgery with friendly staff, especially reception.  Easy to get appointments when I need them.  All works well for me"
Shotley,Excellent. Online appointments are great,9/21/2017,5,Very happy.  Surgery is good.  Rally like the online prescription and appointment system; saves going to the surgery and booking online means you get to see the clinician of your choice.
Shotley,Felt listened to. Good explanation,6/21/2019,5,Good explanation by doctor. I didn't have to wait long for my appointment. I felt listened to. The doctor helped me.
Shotley,Friendly and helpful,11/25/2022,5,"Normally you can get appointments on the day for doctors and to see the nurse for a specific regular test I book ahead so what they need can be ordered in, so I've found the system in place is working well for me. I have no complaints at all and feel very lucky to have the surgery. The staff are friendly and helpful and they look after me well."
Shotley,Generally a good surgery,12/14/2017,4,If you want to see a specific GP you have to wait longer but generally they are a good surgery. Would prefer it if they could be open lunchtime.
Shotley,Generally a good surgery,12/14/2017,4,Generally a good surgery. If you can't get an appointment on the day in the morning the doctor will call back to see if you need to be seen. A clean and tidy surgery but the waiting room is quite small but not much can be done.
Shotley,Get to see my own GP,5/12/2018,5,"I mainly see my own doctor and get most of my blood tests done at the surgery but because I need to be taken to my appointments it can be difficult to get blood tests at suitable times, if this happens I can go to the Riverside though. Very happy with the care."
Shotley,Good staff at the surgery,4/29/2015,5,"The staff at the surgery especially the receptionists, nurses and pharmacy staff are good a. They listen to what you are saying and do all they can to be accommodating."
Shotley,Happy with my doctor,4/29/2015,5,Overall I am happy with my doctor and I like his attitude. But last year I was called on the phone and asked about being resuscitated but I didn't feel this was some thing I wanted to decide while on the phone. Getting to appointments is difficult so the doctor often calls me to discuss things so I don't go in unnecessarily.
Shotley,Happy with staff,11/25/2022,4,"The biggest issue is getting through on the phone which takes a while and is difficult when you work early in the morning and it can then be difficult to get back for on the day appointments. I'm very happy with staff and never have any issues, just wish there was an alternative to calling the suregry.  They are very busy but I'm glad I've been able to get an appointment and have been seen."
Shotley,Helpful and accommodating,5/12/2018,5,I really appreciate the surgery and the staff there. They are so helpful and accommodating and do all they can to fit you in. I get on very well with my GP but at times it is nice to see a female doctor. I can get my blood tests done at the surgery which is really good.
Shotley,Helpful staff,11/2/2019,5,"Very pleased with the surgery, they do a very good job. Appointments are easy enough to get and although you generally see who is available you can also wait longer to see a specific doctor. Staff are helpful and reception staff do what they can to get you seen quickly."
Shotley,Love the surgery,1/8/2022,5,"All the family come here and they're brilliant. Staff are great, really polite and accommodating and will spend time with you to discuss issues. Appointment times and availability is good and when you need an appointment they are available."
Shotley,Never know which GP you will see,12/14/2017,3,You never know which doctor you will see but you do get an appointment when you need one. Would prefer better continuity. Not too bad getting an appointment. The 10 minute appointments don't give them enough time to discuss issues.
Shotley,No issues,1/8/2022,4,I have regular blood tests which are fine to book and I'm seen quickly. I use both online and the phone to contact the surgery depending on the situation and both options work well.
Shotley,No problems,11/25/2022,4,Friends say that they sometimes can't get seen on the day but they are normally seen the next but I've not had any problems getting an appointment when I've needed them so I'm very happy.  It is concerning that you can't always get the appointment at Holbrook which would be a bit easier.
Shotley,Nurse is brilliant,1/8/2022,4,I have regular blood tests and try to see the same nurse if possible as they are brilliant at taking blood from me. I do feel that other staff could be more skilled when taking blood.  I've not needed any actual appointments with a doctor recently but feel it would be difficult to get one and have avoided contacting the surgery as a result.
Shotley,Overall very good,5/12/2018,5,Continuity with GPs doesn't always happen and it would be nice if it could happen more. Overall the surgery is very good and doctors and all staff are friendly and approachable.
Shotley,Oxygen supply - good referral,12/5/2016,5,"Obtaining oxygen cylinder for asbestosis COPD. Told it was not available from doctor, found out it was from county council health centre. Would send papers to Dr for him to refer. 'Phoned and told doctor."
Shotley,Personal touch,11/2/2019,5,"I like that the doctor comes out to call you in for your appointment, its a nice personal touch. I really like my doctor alot, they are good and explain things well."
Shotley,Pleasant staff,1/8/2022,5,"It's a very good surgery, everything is quick and easy and appointments are available with in a few hours of calling the surgery, so it's all great. I do my prescriptions online but tend to call the surgery to arrange appointments as I  prefer to talk to someone about the options."
Shotley,poor,3/16/2016,2,needs update and redecoration
Shotley,Quick to get an appointment,1/8/2022,4,"Other than there being slight delays when you're waiting for an appointment at the surgery everything is fine. We've called this morning and were given an appointment straight away with a doctor and we've been in a number of times this week, the staff have been great at all the appointments we've had."
Shotley,Really like my doctor,5/12/2018,5,The surgery is great. I really like my doctor and although I don't get to see them every time it works well and I like all the doctors at the surgery.
Shotley,Reception,1/8/2022,4,"I've noticed that there have been issues with the Holbrook reception recently but I called yesterday and spoke to a doctor which was great and really quick too. I've come in this morning and seen someone and overall it's been very good, its just noticable that staffing on reception is a problem.  It's concerning for patients especially older people like my parents when the practice needs to briefly close a reception at one of the surgeries."
Shotley,Test results letter made me worry,4/29/2015,4,"Following blood tests I received a letter to say I had abnormalities in the results and that they needed to see me, when I went to the appointment it was only showing slightly low in salt which they will not do anything about. This could have been said over the phone and I wouldn't have been worrying."
Shotley,They do their best,5/12/2018,5,I get to see the same doctor all the time and staff do all they can to fit you in as quickly as possible. Normally I can get my blood tests done at the surgery but if its difficult there is always the option to go to the Riverside.
Shotley,Today has been fine,11/25/2022,4,"Today has been fine to get an appointment but recently it hasn't always been so easy. I recently called the Holbrook surgery and the phone just rang and rang there was no message or anything, in the end I just gave up. I have a feeling the surgery may have been closed but I'm not sure.  It would be good if the surgery could communicate why there are problems at the moment and how they are addressing them as I'm not sure why it is so difficult to get an appointment at Holbrook now. Once seen the care is good it's just getting an appointment especially at Holbrook thats the issue."
Shotley,Under pressure,11/25/2022,4,It all seems under pressure at the moment and I think I've probably made my situation worse by staying away and should've come in sooner. I am concerned it is more difficult to get seen by a GP but I would be happy to see other professionals like a paramedic if that was available. I just don't understand why its so different since the pandemic. If the practice could explain some of the issues it would help understand the difficulties being faced.
Shotley,Very busy phones,11/25/2022,4,I normally attend the Holbrook surgery but there are fewer appointments available there. I phoned at 8 am and the phones were very busy and I kept being told to call back. In the end I joined the waiting list and had to listen to the really bad music for a while. Once I spoke to reception though they were great and I was given an appointment with a doctor who is caring and approachable.  There are now longer waits to get prescriptions and if I put it in on Monday it won't always be ready by the end of the week.
Shotley,Very good,11/25/2022,5,"It's a friendly surgery and pretty much can get an appointment on the day you want. The staff and doctors are great, really helpful. I've had my medication reviews done every six months which seems a little too frequent and they've been done by phone and online which has been ok. The system could be simpler and I've come close to running out of my medication while it's all being processed. I would actually prefer to do more things online if possible."
Shotley,Very good surgery,1/8/2022,5,"Overall a very good surgery the only small issue is when medication reveiws are done by the pharmacist. The process is long and drawn out and it seems to take more staff time and contact than in previous years. Now to arrange a blood test you have to call reception, ask to speak to a GP, wait for a call back for them to say yes you need a blood test. You then have to call the surgery back again to book it and the medication review too which all seems to add to the numer of times you have to contact staff, especially reception who are under extreme pressure. I do also worry whether the pharmacist will know much about my condition too."
Shotley,Very good. Easy to get appointments,12/14/2017,5,Very good. Get to see the same doctor all the time and appointments aren't difficult to get.
Siam,25 years spent at this GP,1/2/2021,4,"Always been with Siam Surgery since I was Born. I have had many long waits whilst feeling ill from being a kid to an adult as well as on time appointments. 

The long waits whilst being ill with tonsillitis for example are very horrible - I sometimes felt that being so ill feeling I should have been seen quicker or before those who were not ill (these would have been ermgency appointments not pre-scheduled). For example when I have been for contraception reasons I don't mind waiting and wouldn't mind a child who is very ill to go first (I realise this is not this particular surgery fault as its a standard form for a GP practice to go by appointment times but maybe this could be past on to those who make the rules as a change needed in future). 

Most of the doctors here have been good with the occasional one not listening to my troubles and just assuming what is wrong with me before I have had a chance to explain myself. But overall mostly good treatment."
Siam,4 star,5/8/2015,4,Disappointed
Siam,45 minutes on hold,1/30/2023,4,I was twelfth in the queue and spent 45 minutes on hold which is difficult when I have to work but I spoke to reception and was given an appointment virtually straight away with a doctor. I really like the doctor I'm seeing as they care and listen.
Siam,A friendly surgery,9/16/2016,4,A friendly surgery. I did miss my appointment due to the bus being late but was told I would just need to book another appointment.
Siam,A good doctor,4/12/2015,4,The doctor told me useful information and what to do for the future.  He was a good doctor.
Siam,A great service,10/14/2021,5,"A great service and the procedure for the flu clinic was great too. The staff and system worked so well, thank you."
Siam,A little concerned,10/14/2021,5,A little concerned I can't ask for a face to face appointment at the moment but do understand that they are increasing these appointments.
Siam,A pleasure to come here,10/24/2019,5,Its a pleasure to come here. I wish there was a water machine though.
Siam,Able to get appointments,6/27/2017,5,"Never had any problems at this surgery as we're able to get appointments whenever we need them. We've had very good asthma care for our child, with regular reviews and great advice from the nurse we see. Very pleased with all the care received."
Siam,Able to request specific doctor,5/13/2022,5,I was on hold for 20 minutes yesterday but it wasn't too bad. I was able to request to see a specific doctor today which is really good. I use the online access as and when but do prefer to call. The doctors are lovely and all the staff are perfectly great.
Siam,Absolutely brilliant,4/2/2022,5,"I simply cannot fault Siam Surgery. I’ve been a patient with them since the year I was born. Receptionists are always lovely both face to face and on the telephone. They can go above and beyond to help you out. All of the doctors are brilliant, friendly and fair. I do not understand why people can be so awful to them! Thank you Siam Surgery."
Siam,Accessible and easy to get to,3/15/2018,4,Accessible and easy to get to. Generally find it ok to get an appointment when needed and the phone system.
Siam,Accomodating staff,1/30/2023,4,I had a pre booked appointment with a nurse today and staff were really accomodating and fitted the appointment around my work and it was quick to get.  The phones are busy but there are lots of people calling and needing help.
Siam,All good,11/10/2021,4,"The flu vaccination clinic has been great, staff were all good too. Generally there are small admin delays at the practice but nothing serious and I'm fairly happy being able to get appointments when needed."
Siam,All so nice and I feel very well supported,4/26/2018,5,"They are all so nice, nothing is too much trouble and they listen to you. Very well supported by staff. However, picking up prescriptions means multiple visits to the pharmacy as they run out at different times, would be helpful if medication could all be for 30 days."
Siam,All very quick,10/15/2021,5,"An efficient flu clinic that ran really smoothly, really can't fault how it operates. Getting normal appointments has also been fine for me, you do need to speak to a doctor but they'll see you if needed."
Siam,All well organised,10/15/2021,5,"Very efficient process, everything was explained well and I was seen before my appointment time."
Siam,Always get seen on time,6/7/2018,5,Always get seen on time and when you call in the morning you always get an appointment. A pharmacy at the healthcentre would be much better.
Siam,Always good,1/30/2023,5,"The surgery has always been good. The phones are busy but that to be expected and appointments are available when I've called so its all worked well for me. Staff are polite, helpful and explain issues well, I've never had a problem and found it a very good surgery. The GP I tend to see is fantastic, I'm confident in her approach and she really discusses issues when trying to decide what to do next.  Doing repeat prescriptions online works well too."
Siam,Always helpful,10/24/2019,5,They are always helpful here and you never feel that you are being a nusance. The reception staff are lovely. I wouldn't change anything here.
Siam,Always helpful and easy getting appointments,3/30/2017,5,Always helpful and get appointments when needed
Siam,Always quite nice on the phone,7/4/2020,4,"It is quite easy to get an appointment and I like the fact that you do not have to wait very long for the phone to be answered. The staff are always quite nice on the phone, I cannot think that any improvements need to be made really."
Siam,Amazing,10/13/2021,5,"Amazing how quick the flu clinic was, really great. Staff have also been great at running the sessions and it has worked very well."
Siam,Appointment easy to get,12/10/2022,5,I called this morning. It took a little while to get through to reception on the phone but it wasn't too bad. Reception arranged for me to have an appointment with a doctor later in the morning so it's been great today as it normally is.
Siam,Appointment system works very well,4/26/2018,4,You can ring up and get appointments when you need them.
Siam,Appointments are difficult,6/15/2016,4,Getting an appointment is difficult. I went with a severe reaction to a wasp sting and I was initially told I couldn't be seen but eventually I was given an appointment.
Siam,Appointments can be difficult,4/26/2018,4,"There are mixed messages given by reception. Some have said there are advanced appointments available, others not. Getting appointments is difficult and there are times when you are told to call back the next day."
Siam,Appointments can be difficult; Drs are good,4/26/2018,5,"Can be a bit difficult to get appointments but generally once in with the doctor, they are good."
Siam,Appointments easy to get,9/22/2016,4,Appointments are easy to get and the doctors are great
Siam,Appointments fine to get,5/13/2022,5,"I've had no issues getting appointments but I do feel at times they just give you medication and don't fully look in to the issues you are presenting with. I come regularly to have my legs dressed and the nurses are lovely, they are very good, so friendly."
Siam,Appointments limited,9/12/2018,4,There are limited appointments available and you can only book on the day so you can end up waiting about a week to be seen. Staff are very pleasant and friendly. I would prefer a turn up and wait system like Bildeston.
Siam,Appointments need to be more punctual,6/4/2020,3,"The waiting at appointment is frustrating. I loose money as I have taken time off work to attend an appointment, I would appreciate the appointments to be more punctual. It is not a bad surgery though, I think there is only one doctor here who seems to give less time to me as a patient, all others give plenty of time."
Siam,Attention to waiting times is okay,6/4/2018,5,"You can see a doctor, you don't have to wait. Phone system works well and you get through ok. A call waiting system would be an improvement so you know how long you're likely to have to wait."
Siam,Been challenging,10/1/2022,4,"I had a phone consultation but felt I needed to be seen in person, I've now been given an appointment with a doctor but it has been quite a challenge to be seen though."
Siam,Been very good,1/30/2023,5,"The staff are understanding and try to get issues sorted quickly. Appointments are available when needed and usually with in the week.  Staff are good and I get to see the same doctor most of the time. I don't feel that anything needs to improve at all, it all works well."
Siam,Better to have pharmacy on site,10/24/2016,4,"It would be much better to have the pharmacy on site.  Public transport is not regular enough.
Although it's a great facility, you can't organize appointments for the different services all for the one day and when this combined with the difficult transport situation it makes it so difficult"
Siam,Blood tests easy to arrange,5/13/2022,4,I call to make appointments for my blood tests really easily. There's sometimes a bit of a wait on the phone but the staff are good and arrange the appointments for when they are needed.
Siam,Booking ahead is more of a challenge,7/4/2020,4,"This is a good surgery. I have found that booking ahead with appointments is more of a challenge, I am a patient that needs an injection once every 3 months but the surgery only allow patients to book 2 weeks in advance, so I have to make sure that I make a note on my calendar to ring the surgery 2 weeks before my injection is due otherwise I run the risk of potentially missing the date, I wish there was a system that allowed me to book my injection appointment at the end of each injection visit."
Siam,Booking appointments can be a mission,6/4/2018,5,"Can be a bit difficult to get appointments but generally once in with the doctor, they are good."
Siam,Booking appointments is fine,6/4/2018,5,Can get an appointment quite quickly. Tend to book by phone which is easy enough. Generally works well and don't have any issues.
Siam,Brief explanations,9/22/2016,3,Some doctors are very brief in their explanations.  The way issues are explained should be in more detail and at times they lack empathy
Siam,Brilliant,11/10/2021,5,"Everything for the flu clinic has run smoothly today and I thought it was a great idea to combine with general health checks, many people haven't had checks for some time due to covid. The staff were helpful, cheerful and kind while doing the injections."
Siam,Brilliant flu clinic,10/13/2021,5,"A really brilliant  and efficient process , in and out with in two minutes. The staff have been really great."
Siam,Brilliant surgery,10/24/2019,5,"This surgery is brilliant, I cannot fault it. The reception staff are very helpful."
Siam,Busy phones,1/30/2023,4,"I called to arrange a doctors appointment but it is a little frustrating sometimes when calling due to the phones being busy.  Appointments are available for non urgent issues with in the week and considering the current situation nothing really needs to improve, it would be nice to be able to book appointments online again."
Siam,Busy phones,12/10/2022,5,The phones are busy in the morning and I got cut off this morning too. I called back and had to wait 12 minutes and the music is very loud.  The staff are excellent and they've fitted us in to be seen this morning as we're very worried about something.
Siam,Call backs have addressed issues,1/20/2022,4,I'm not having any issues getting appointments when they are needed and I tend to call the surgery to book. The call backs I've had have all addressed the issues I've had and when needed I've been offered a face to face appointment which worked well too.  Staff are always friendly and easy to talk to.
Siam,Calling the surgery can take a while to get through.,10/24/2016,5,"Calling the surgery can take a while to get through, it just rings and rings.
Really can't fault the service at all.
Sometimes when I'm called by the doctor I can't hear my name very well.  I would help if they spoke louder,"
Siam,Can always get an appointment.,4/1/2019,5,"You can always get an appointment when you need one, I like that reception staff ask why you need an appointment as it means they can get you to see the most appropriate person. Over the last year its definitely got easier to get appointments which is good. Its also good that there is more promotion of the things like flu vaccinations so you are aware of what is available, continue with the health promotion."
Siam,Can call easily for appointments,5/9/2018,4,Generally I can get appointments when I need them. Its better with the new system whereby you can phone in the morning and get an appointment in the afternoon.
Siam,Can choose doctor,5/9/2018,4,You can choose which doctor you'd like to see and then keep seeing them which is good. Once you find a doctor who listens and understands it works better. The asthma care is a bit difficult as all appointments are during school hours and there are only limited days available. It would be better if an out of school hours service was available to prevent taking the children out of school regularly. Its not difficult to get appointments at the surgery generally.
Siam,"Can get appts, communication lacking",6/4/2018,3,Can get appointments when we need them. Generally works very well for me. Do feel through and not listened to by doctors.
Siam,Can't fault the surgery,5/13/2022,5,"They do everything really well, appointments are available when needed, I have a good rapport with all the staff and you get to see the right person at the right time which is what you need."
Siam,Can't understand why the surgery has moved,10/24/2016,1,"Can't understand why the surgery has moved and accessing it is difficult as I'm no longer allowed to drive.  
Medical profession has let me down;  they don't take my concerns seriously,
It would help to have a path coming in from the road rather than having to go right round the corner to get into the health centre"
Siam,Care isn't as good as previous years,6/21/2018,3,I can get appointments when I need them. I do feel that the care isn't as good as years ago and getting to the surgery is very difficult.
Siam,Care provided is good.,10/24/2016,4,Feel that the health centre should've been a hospital like the one in town.  Care provided by the GPs and nurses has been good and never have problems getting appointments
Siam,Caring staff,5/9/2018,5,"Very efficient, you can get appointments when they are needed and staff are very very good, they have a caring nature. There's nothing that needs improving at this time."
Siam,Certain doctors here are very good,10/24/2019,4,There are certain doctors here who are very good. I am happy with this surgery. The transport is not good to and from the surgery. I think there should be more clinics here to include minor injuries clinic.
Siam,Choice of doctor,1/30/2023,5,I tend to walk to the surgery to book appointments as we live locally and its easier to do than calling.  For this appointment I was able to choose who to see and I'm seeing the doctor I would prefer.
Siam,Come to the surgery to book,1/30/2023,4,We come up to the surgery to book appointments as getting through on the phone can be difficult. We came up last week and have a non urgent appointment booked for today which is five days later.  Luckily we haven't had anything urgent as we would be unsure how it would be to get one more quickly.
Siam,Comms and continuity is awful,6/4/2018,2,"Don't feel listened to and dismissed, don't feel that they care. Been a few times and still don't feel heard. The continuity has been an issue. Doctors don't seem to read notes prior to appointments."
Siam,Concern about diabetes care,10/24/2019,3,"I am concerned about the diabetes care for my husband, he has not been seen in over a year, surgery says its his responsibility to keep up to date. Refused test strips for blood glucose machine to check blood levels as he shouldn't be testing! even though he had a near diabetic coma earlier this year and ended up in hospital."
Siam,Continuity can be better,6/4/2018,5,"Very good surgery, convenient and very helpful staff, can get appointments. Continuity is an issue and it means that you get differing advice."
Siam,Coping well,1/18/2022,4,I've had telephone and face to face consultations and both have worked well for the circumstances. The surgery seem to be coping well all things considered. Most staff are good at explaining issues but it can slightly depend on who you see.
Siam,Delay when seeing a nurse,10/24/2016,4,"The location of the surgery is good as is the care provided.  Having the pharmacy on site would be much easier.
Getting appointments is generally ok.
Nurses tend to run behind time by quite a lot."
Siam,Difficult to get an appointment with a specific Dr.,10/24/2016,4,It can be a little difficult to get an appointment with a specific doctor.  I don't feel I get the right information; it can depend on who you see.  Waiting times are quite long.  Depending on who you see changes the information they provide and I sometimes have to ask
Siam,Difficult to hear when you are being called.,10/24/2016,5,"When the the waiting area is busy it's difficult to hear when you are being called.  Can't fault the service, my care has been great"
Siam,Disorganised at times,5/9/2018,3,A bit disorganised at times and it can take a week to get an appointment.
Siam,Doctor has been very good,7/27/2018,5,The doctor has been very good and due to the difficulties we experience they have agreed that information can about the need for the appointment can be given to the doctor before the appointment to help understand the issues that need to be discussed. The have been very accomodating and helpful and this system has been a real benefit. The receptionists have been very accomodating too and will always try to fit you in when you need an appointment.
Siam,Doctors are unaware,6/4/2018,5,No issues generally but I do feel that doctors are unaware of the severity of the challenging behaviours my son can exhibit and therefore don't communicate with as well each visit.
Siam,Doctors need to be more understanding,6/21/2018,2,Attitude of doctors needs to change and be more understanding. A doctor spoke to me in a bad way that hurt my feelings.
Siam,Doctors okay,6/22/2018,5,Doctors are okay but the location of the surgery is out of the way and difficult to access. If you work it is difficult to get an appointment that is after work.
Siam,Don't feel listened to,6/20/2017,2,"I don't feel listened to at all and feel fobbed off, even though I have concerns. I've asked for explanations but have been told not to worry but I want to know."
Siam,Don't feel valued or listened to,6/4/2018,1,"Been given wrong information about what has been wrong and feel very fobbed off. Took a personal call in my appointment and then prescribed a medication that was contradicted. Don't feel listened to at all or supported in any way. It's been months with no answers, were told that he had a condition only for the next blood test results to contradict with no explanation. Don't feel they listen at all and they hardly spend anytime with you."
Siam,Don't have trouble getting appointments,10/24/2016,5,Quite a good surgery; the doctors and nurses and don't have trouble getting appointments.  Waiting times for appointments are normally about 10 - 15 minutes which is ok
Siam,Don't use much,5/13/2022,5,I don't need to use the surgery much but I've called this morning and been given an appointment straight away. The staff are always happy to help and as a new patient I've been nothing but impressed.
Siam,Drs are helpful.,10/24/2016,5,Doctors I've seen have been very helpful
Siam,Easier now,10/1/2022,5,"It was previously more challenging but I've been able to get an appointment and when I've asked to see a GP I've been able to do that too. Getting through on the phone does take time and is a little frustrating  but staff are good and it tends to run smoothly, including the flu vaccinations and text messages about them which were great."
Siam,Easy to arrange,10/1/2022,5,As a new patient the transfer from our old surgery has gone smoothly with no issues and I was able to arrange to have my vaccination today so its all been good so far.
Siam,Easy to get appointments,10/24/2016,4,It's a good surgery and it's pretty good at getting appointments.  Normally I see the nurses.  They have been very good and one particularly has been very thorough.
Siam,Easy to get appointments,9/22/2016,4,Never had any problems getting an appointment and I'm happy to see any GP available.  Generally it works ok for me
Siam,Easy to get appointments.,10/24/2016,4,Never struggled to get appointments.  They've always been very good with the children.  Just generally a good surgery;  there is nothing that really needs improving
Siam,es - good,9/22/2016,4,Reception staff can be a little impatient with you. I don't always feel I'm listened to by my GP.  At my last appointment I wanted to raise a second issue but wasn't allowed to raise it and was told I needed another appointment. Explanations can be too brief and not enough information provided.  They tend to look at the screen rather than me as the patient
Siam,Everything works well,10/24/2016,5,"The service meets my needs, everything works well"
Siam,Excellent,1/30/2023,5,No problems getting appointments at all. Its a very smooth process and almost immediate appointments and they are on the ball with check ups. Appointments run to time and I'm really happy with the staff. I don't feel that  anything needs to be improved.
Siam,Excellent,11/10/2021,5,I saw the nurse practitioner after calling and was really happy with the whole appointment. Thank you
Siam,Excellent,10/4/2017,5,Happy with the surgery.It's nice to have everything under one roof.  Nothing needs changing.  It all works well.
Siam,Excellent,10/4/2017,5,I have a good relationship with the nurse I see and my condition is controlled well.  Everything is good
Siam,Excellent,10/4/2017,5,Met my needs so far.  A little bit of a wait to see the nurse
Siam,Excellent,10/4/2017,5,Able to get appointments when I need them and everything is good at the surgery
Siam,Excellent,10/4/2017,5,Only been once before but everything went well when getting the appointment and during it.
Siam,Excellent,3/30/2017,5,Doctor we saw was great and reception were great too by getting us seen straight away to sort out a problem
Siam,Excellent,7/3/2017,5,I tend to see the parkinsons nurse who is great.  I see her every 6 months and she is very supportive and caring.  I get all the information I need from her  as when I've visited other GPs they haven't been that intersted
Siam,excellent,9/14/2017,5,All staff are fantastic.  Today the doctor was spot on time and the diabetic nurse is always great.  The only difficulty is getting to the surgery as I'm now reliant on family to take me to appts whereas previously I could walk
Siam,excellent,9/14/2017,5,If I didn't have a car it would be very difficult.  If you are reliant on buses it can be a 4 hour round trip.  Buses are hourly from the surgery.  It would be better to have a surgery here rather than having to go into town
Siam,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"Not seeing the same doctor all the time means you have to repeat your history and there is little continuity.
A little concerning when you are reliant on taxis or buses and you are trying to combine appts as it only takes a small delay for you to miss the bus"
Siam,excellent,9/14/2017,5,.  Reception have been good and we  never have problems getting an appt.  Some staff could be a little more understanding.  There are times when you have to wait but we understand some people need more time than others.
Siam,excellent,9/14/2017,5,"The staff at the surgery are great.  I'm confident in the diabetic and asthma nurses.  I try to keep with the same doctor for continuity and I've managed to get appts when needed.
Having a pharmacy here would make it much better"
Siam,Excellent,7/12/2015,5,Friendly. Good experience. Helpful
Siam,Excellent,7/12/2015,5,Very friendly staff and always reassure me.  Always leave me with a clean feeling mouth.  I still get stickers and I am a teenager!
Siam,Excellent,9/10/2015,3,My doctor is excellent.
Siam,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,There are nice nurses to do the blood tests.  I see the same doctor all the time which helps as it means I don't have to explain things all the time
Siam,Excellent all round,10/4/2017,5,Doctors take time to talk to you about the issues .  They listen and spend time with you.  Don't think the surgery could do anymore especially when dealing with the children.  Explanations are very good.
Siam,Excellent care and peasant environment.,10/4/2017,5,Excellent care provided.  Pleasant and nice environment at the surgery.  Organised surgery
Siam,Excellent care but could do with better signage,3/30/2017,5,some clear signage would help patients coming in to the building to make sure they know where to go. The care and treatment is very good
Siam,Excellent flu clinic,10/13/2021,5,"A really great experience, it worked well and was great to have the health checks at the same time."

Siam,Excellent staff,10/4/2017,5,Staff are good and treat you well
Siam,Excellent surgery,1/2/2023,5,Its an excellent surgery and I really can't fault them at all.  I prebooked my appointment with a nurse and it was easy to arrange and get at a convenient time with the lovely nurse. Reception staff are really helpful and the clinical staff are so lovely.
Siam,Excellent with a lovely atmosphere,10/4/2017,5,Always been very good to me. As a patient it is sometimes difficult to know what questions to ask.  There is a lovely atmosphere at the practice with smiley faces and very helpful
Siam,"Excellent, can usually get appointments",10/4/2017,5,Can normally get appointments quite quickly  Surgery is generally okay
Siam,"Excellent, friendly staff and supportive doctors",5/1/2017,5,Never had any problems.  I can't fault the surgery at all.  All staff are friendly.  At a really difficult time the doctors were amazingly supportive.
Siam,"Excellent, no complaints at all",10/4/2017,5,A really loveley surgery.  Runs to time.  Easy access.  Very fortunate to have this surgery.  No complaints whatsoever
Siam,"Excellent, no problems with appointments",5/1/2017,5,Tend to book by phone but don't have problems getting appointments and everything works well for me
Siam,"Excellent, wonderful staff, great nurses",5/1/2017,5,"Excellent, wonderful staff.  I visit regularly to have my wound dressed and the nurses have been great.  I can't think of anything that needs changing"
Siam,Excellent.,5/1/2017,5,Generally use the online system to book appointments but today I have an appointment where I have to wait my turn.  On a couple of occasions I've been told by reception that no appointments are available only to go online and see if a sooner appointment is available
Siam,"Excellent. Friendly staff, GP's mostly very good, good explanations",5/1/2017,5,"Very friendly staff.  Most of the doctors are very good.
Very good explanations"
Siam,Excellent. Plenty of parking and very good staff,3/30/2017,5,"I like that there is a lot of parking.  It won't be so good when we can't drive.  Very good staff, no problems"
Siam,Excellent. Staff are friendly and can get appointments,10/4/2017,5,Very good when I've used it.  On the whole I can get appointments when I need them and I get the time needed. Staff are very friendly and approachable
Siam,Excellent. Staff helpful and my condition is well managed.,10/4/2017,5,I don't come very often but when I do it's been good. Mostly see the nurse and my condition is managed well. Generally the surgery works well for me and staff are helpful.
Siam,Exemplary service,10/24/2019,5,"The surgery is exemplary. The staff are very helpful in trying to find an appointment, an excellent referral made recently to the hospital. There isn't anything that I have found that is bad, its only been good. The chemotherapy bus that comes to this location is brilliant, its a real asset."
Siam,Explanations are good,5/9/2018,5,"The surgery is very good, the service you get is great and you can get to see a doctor and they explain things well."
Siam,Face to face appointment available,10/1/2022,5,"I asked for a face to face appointment with a GP to discuss hospital test results  and I had no problem getting the appointment. I see the practice nurse who monitors my blood pressure but getting to the health centre for appointments is not easy due to the lack of buses, I understand that's not in the control of the surgery though. It would be great to have the addition of a minor injury service at the centre."
Siam,fair,6/21/2016,3,I feel at times that nurses do not listen to my concerns.  I feel that my condition has changed but I am not being listened to.  On a number of occasions I have not had the correct number of medication on my repeat prescription.  I have raised this over the years but it has not been fully addressed
Siam,fair,6/21/2016,3,"I have had problems with my prescription, where all 3 items are coming up on different dates.  Prescription has been lost a few times between here and pharmacy.  This meant that I ran out of medication as I needed the prescription re-issued.  Because of the number of tablets prescribed each month it means I'm a little short of one and have too many of the other"
Siam,Fair but getting an appointment can be hard if you specify a GP,10/4/2017,3,Being able to get an appointment is difficult if you want to see the same doctor.  They are always good when you see them bu i would like to see the same GP more often
Siam,Fairly easy to make an appointment,7/4/2020,5,"Appointment making is fairly easy, you do have to wait on the phone a little while before they answer, but I do understand as they are a busy surgery. I always ask for one particular doctor and I am often prepared to wait to see him but they can usually arrange this. It works well for me here I do not have any concerns."
Siam,Fairly quick to get through,10/1/2022,4,"I called earlier in the week and was given an appointment with the nurse practitioner. It was fairly quick to get through on the phone, even on a Monday. It is quite a good surgery and the staff are good at talking to you."
Siam,Fantastic surgery,5/13/2022,5,"I get to see a doctor or nurse with no problems at all. I speak to reception and they are able to book an appointment for me. The nurse practitioner is kind, compassionate, lovely and very good at what she does. It all works well for me, I don't tend to use online services as phoning works so well."
Siam,"Fantastic, very helpful",10/4/2017,5,The surgery is fantastic.  They do all they can to help you out and will squeeze you in when you really need an appointment
Siam,Fast process,11/10/2021,5,The flu clinic was really fast and efficient and everyone was friendly and explained what was going to be done.
Siam,Fine,12/10/2022,4,"Fine at the moment. I've been able to get an appointment with the nurse with no problem at all and I haven't had to wait long for it either, the nurses are really lovely too.   I've had real problems with tonsilitis for a long time it was not being addressed by the suregry. In the end I went through 111 and ended up being referred to hospital that way and have since had them removed. I do feel I should've been listened to more by doctors at the practice."
Siam,Fine with the majority,6/4/2018,5,Always really friendly and efficient. Generally got through on the phone to book appointments ok. Not having advanced appointments does make it more difficult but the staff have been great. I have had difficulties with notes being viewable from Colchester.
Siam,Fine with the surgery,6/4/2018,5,No problems with the surgery can get appointments easy enough. The cardiac nurse has been very good with good links with community services.
Siam,Flu clinic runs so well,10/13/2021,5,"The session was really great, no issues and it runs so well. For general appointments there can be a bit of a wait to get through on the phone but considering the situation it's not too bad at all. Thanks very much for everything you are doing,staff are great."
Siam,Flu clinic was good,11/10/2021,4,"The flu clinic was excellent, booking was no issue at all and I was sent multiple reminders by text which is a great idea. For general appointments, getting through on the phone can be a bit of a wait."
Siam,Flu clinic went well,10/14/2021,5,The process in place for the vaccinations went really well and the interaction with staff has been great. I've not needed to visit the surgery for an appointment recently but all contact with the surgery has been great.
Siam,Flu clinic went well,10/13/2021,5,"The surgery is good, I tend to get to see the doctor I prefer and I don't have concerns about getting an appointment."
Siam,Flu clinic went well,11/10/2021,4,"Everything went well it was a very quick process, efficient ans friendly. Compliments to all staff involved."
Siam,Flu clinic worked well,10/13/2021,5,"The process has worked so well for us, very smooth. All staff have been great, thanks"
Siam,Flu clinic worked well,11/10/2021,5,"It's been brilliant and worked so well. The turnaround was quick, its just a bit of a long walk round the building with the one way system in place."
Siam,Friendly and kind,3/2/2017,5,The nurse has been friendly and kind to me
Siam,Friendly helpful staff,4/1/2019,5,"There are good staff who are friendly and helpful. Appointments are easy enough to  get when you need them which is good and you get plenty of time when you are in you appointment and don't feel rushed. I'm very happy with the surgery generally, it does what you need and well."
Siam,Friendly nurses,4/1/2019,5,My leg ulcers are being treated and I have regular visits to the surgery. The nurses I see are all very nice and friendly. Most of the time I need more urgent appointments when I do need them but I'm always given an appointment which is great. Although my legs are treated at the leg ulcer clinic the ulcer on my arm has to be treated at a different appointment which seems a bit silly.
Siam,Friendly staff,5/13/2022,5,I have to book monthly appointments with the nurse and have no issues getting the appointments I need. I do prefer to phone the surgery and talk to someone to arrange things and this works well. The staff are always friendly and helpful and I really can't fault the surgery.
Siam,Friendly staff,6/10/2016,5,No problems with good friendly staff
Siam,Friendly staff,6/10/2016,5,"No problems, with good friendly staff."
Siam,Frustrating,1/13/2023,2,"Comment is not about recent contact rather it is my frustration in gaining access to service. I waited two hours and 10 minutes to have reception answer the phone. A week later I phoned at 1:30 pm for another appointment, only to be told surgery was closed for training in the afternoon via answer machine."
Siam,Generally can see a doctor when you want,6/10/2016,4,Generally you can see a doctor when you want but not necessarily who you want. Depending who you see treatment explanation can vary and it also depends if you ask questions.
Siam,"Generally excellent, can always get an appointment",5/1/2017,5,Apart from one very bad experience everything has been very good.  If you really need an appointment you will always get one.  Good with the children.  I needed to cancel an appointment one one occasion but was unable to get through on the phone to do so
Siam,Generally good,11/10/2021,5,"Getting general appointments is all good, the only issue is you have to wait a bit on the phone trying to get through to reception. The flu clinic was a great experience, and has worked well and was a smooth process from booking through to today. A big thank you for staff who are amazing and great."
Siam,Generally good but sometime need more explanations.,10/4/2017,4,"The majority of the time it's good.  On a few occasions it's not been so good, normally due to a lack of explanation.  Waiting times vary at times but not unexpected.  It would be nice if staff could explain things fully to ensure that I understand what is happening and what the next steps are."
Siam,Generally the service works for me,5/1/2017,5,Some doctors don't seem to care when you see them but others are good.  Generally the service works for me and I can get an appointment.  The online phone system and text reminder service works well and is helpful.  Depending on who you see it can make a difference and how interested staff are in what is happening
Siam,Generally works well for me,4/26/2018,4,Find it easy to make an appointment. Staff are friendly. Generally works well for me.
Siam,Getting appointments can be difficult,3/5/2018,3,"Tried to book an appointment last week, but none were available, so I ended up going to A&E at West Suffolk Hospital. I wasn't offered an appointment at all with any practitioner."
Siam,Getting appointments never a problem,9/16/2016,5,Its a real shame we are losing a great GP. Getting appointments is never a problem.
Siam,Getting through is difficult,10/13/2021,3,"Getting through on the phone is difficult and I've been cut off three times, it's incredibly frustrating. We have had issues with my husband on the run up to his operation, we couldn't get him seen by a GP to sort out issues and there are times when seeing a GP is needed."
Siam,Good,7/3/2019,4,"LD health check letters didn't arrive this year but were chased.  All ok now as appointments arranged.
In a previous year all appointments were on the same day one after the other which made supporting service users very difficult."
Siam,Good,10/4/2017,4,"Doctors and nurses have been very good but when you try to book an appointment some of the staff can be quite abrupt and sharp. When you are told by staff to come back next week but reception don't seem to want to help. The location of the surgery and parking is good. Online booking does help at times.  However there are times when no appointments are available for weeks and some clinics are also not available online.  The appointments regularly run behind by up to 1/2 hour, in the extreme it's been 45 minutes"
Siam,good,7/3/2019,4,"Diabetic nurse is very goo, explains everything. lots of advice around diet as well.  Having a pharmacy on site would be much better and make sense.  Transport is a particular issue especially if you can't drive.  I didn't get a text reminder for this apt but normally do.  If people have a later appt. the buses stop too early to get home.  Having a weekend surgery would be great"
Siam,good,7/3/2019,4,The doctor I see most is very good and I like the continuity.  Calling at 8 am will mean you will get an appt.  Getting to and from the surgery is expensive - £11 round trip and if the pharmacy was here too rather than in town it would help
Siam,good,7/3/2019,4,I have ongoing issues so try to see the same doctor to get continuity with my care.  But if this is not possible I am happy to see another doctor.  It's a nice personal service that supports our family.  Text reminder service is good and works well
Siam,good,7/3/2019,4,The nurse has been excellent.  I see her every month - so friendly and I feel at ease with her.  If you ring at 8 am you will get an apt that day.  If you want to see a specific doctor it can be a bit more of a delay
Siam,good,7/3/2019,4,"It would be nice to be told if there are delays.  Generally it's a good surgery but you may have to wait for your appt.  Getting an appt. on the day is not a problem.  Explanations can be a little vague at times.
A few months ago I had an ECG and the nurse was great, explained everything and was really reassuring"
Siam,good,7/3/2019,4,"I have a complicated condition & not seeing the same doctor all the time means you feel you are having to go over everything that has been tried before.  Not having continuity makes it more difficult.
At times it feels like they just give me tablets and move me out of the door.  It would be good to be able to book in advance so I can see the same doctor so that it is less frustrating going over everything.  Different doctors also have different ideas which means you get an inconsistent approach"
Siam,Good,7/12/2015,4,I had a blood test but the day after I had to go back because they messed up my test
Siam,Good all round service,4/1/2019,5,"The GP's are friendly and approachable. Generally you can get appointments when they're needed, if you need an emergency appointment you'll get one the same day, sometimes you have to wait for a call back from the doctor who then decides if you need to go in. Doctors also call with blood test results and they provide good explanations and information during consultations. It can take time to get through at busy times when you're on the phone."
Siam,Good but need a pharmacy and more toys for children,5/1/2017,4,A larger building is great and increased services a bonus.  Not having a pharmacy is problematic for patients and it would be better if there was a play area/toys for children
Siam,Good but transport a problem so is seeing a GP of choice,5/1/2017,4,Transport is quite difficult and costly when you visit regularly.  It's sometimes a bit of an issue getting to see a doctor of your choice
Siam,Good communication here,10/24/2019,5,The staff are so helpful and they do not keep you hanging about. Also good communication here.
Siam,Good doctor,7/4/2020,4,"My doctor is very good, he always seems to sort things out for us. I really don't think any improvements are needed."
Siam,Good experience,5/13/2022,5,"I'm a new patient, I called the surgery last night and was given an appointment for first thing this morning which was really good. All my contact with the surgery has been very good since I moved to the practice, very impressed so far as the reception staff have been helpful and friendly."
Siam,Good experience so far,4/1/2019,4,The experience I've had so far has been good. The nurse practitioner I've seen has been very caring and gave good explanations. Appointments are fine to get and have all been on the day I've called.
Siam,good overall,8/14/2015,4,I've been at the surgery for years and if I need to see a doctor I can always get an appointment
Siam,Good staff,1/2/2023,5,"It's pretty good to get appointments. This one was pre arranged to see a doctor following an earlier appointment.  Staff are very good, very attentive and explain issues well. I really can't fault the surgery."
Siam,Good waiting times but felt wasn't listened to,10/4/2017,4,"On my last visit I didn't feel I was listened to brilliantly but hope today will be different.  Very quickly seen, very little waiting around"
Siam,Good with getting appointments,6/4/2018,4,You can ring up and get appointments when you need them.
Siam,"Good, can get appointments when needed.",10/4/2017,4,Generally a good surgery where you can get appointments when needed.  It all works well for me
Siam,Great,11/10/2021,5,I don't come often but when I do it's great and I'm confident that when I need appointments I can get them.
Siam,Great job,10/13/2021,5,All went so well this morning and there's nothing that needs to be changed to make it better. All the staff and volunteers have done a great job.
Siam,great team,9/29/2019,5,"The receptionists are the front door to the Surgery and need to know the essence of the problem in order to signpost me to the most appropriate person to treat me (Dr/nurse/physio etc). In this way, appointments are not wasted by seeing someone inappropriate. All treat my health in confidence and I have no issues with this at all."
Siam,Great to include health checks,10/13/2021,5,It was a great idea to include the health checks at the flu clinic. The whole practice is good but the nurses are really great as they are so supportive. Referrals on to hospital have also been done very well.
Siam,Happier with the new health centre,5/17/2018,3,"Happier with the new health centre, much more convenient. Getting appointments is very difficult, there is no continuity but the doctors are very good. It's only the appointment system that is letting them down. Not had care navigation explained or reasons for questions"
Siam,Happy to see most medical staff,4/1/2019,5,The attitude of staff is good and they're all very helpful. I can usually get an appointment when I need one and I'm happy to see most of the medical staff but do try to see the same doctor who knows me and I have a good rapport with. I don't feel that anything at the surgery needs to change.
Siam,Happy with administration,6/4/2018,5,"Get appointments when I need them. Booking process works well, don't mind who I see, generally works well, all fine."
Siam,Happy with staff,4/1/2019,5,"Generally very happy with staff, they are good at fitting you in for appointments when you need one. Its all very good and well run, I don't feel rushed in appointments even if they are running behind."
Siam,Happy with the service,12/14/2018,5,"You can get appointments with a specific doctor when needed, so I'm happy with the service provided."
Siam,Has worked well,1/20/2022,5,I'm a new patient and everything has gone very smoothly. I've been invited in for my diabetic check up and they've sorted out some medication issues I had before moving here. The flu jab session here was also very well run.
Siam,Helpful staff,5/13/2022,5,Nothing needs to change at all at this surgery. I tend to contact the surgery mostly online and this works really well for me and is convenient and easy to use. My annual check up was booked online which was easy to do and the diabetic care pathway is great. I'm seen regularly and given good advice and I know I can always ring the nurse if I have any  concerns or questions.
Siam,Helpful staff,4/1/2019,5,A good surgery where staff are friendly and helpful. You can always get appointments when needed and the care and treatment is good.
Siam,I get appointments easily,7/4/2020,4,"I can get appointments as I need them easily, I phone one day and they give me an appointment either the same day or the next day, very good service. I find that they are usually on time with the appointments I don't find myself waiting very long, staff are always welcoming here, I have never had to question or complain about anything."
Siam,I got an appointment straight away,10/24/2016,5,"Do feel that I'm not getting to the bottom of my problems. I got an appointment straight away.
The system works generally ok."
Siam,I use the on line booking for appointments,10/24/2019,5,I use the online booking for appointments and it works well. I usually wait about 2 weeks for an appointment.
Siam,I would visit all apart from one doctor,7/4/2020,4,"It is easy for me to get an appointment when I need one, the doctors are very good apart from one, they do not listen to me well enough and so I would avoid that doctor."
Siam,Impressed with the efficiency of this surgery,7/4/2020,5,"I am impressed with the efficiency of this surgery, it is run very well. The front desk staff have an excellent attitude. They are able to provide good consistency of being able to see the same GP which is important to me. Getting through on the phone is fine."
Siam,In 32 yrs they have always looked after me,7/4/2020,5,"I have been coming to this surgery for 32 years and they have always looked after me well, as I am a patient considered to be higher risk I always get an appointment when I need one, I really don't think they can improve for me."
Siam,In and out quickly,5/9/2018,5,"I'm satisfied with the surgery, you're in and out quickly which is good and it all works well for me."
Siam,It runs smoothly and well.,10/24/2016,5,Most of the time staff are really great.  It runs smoothly and well
Siam,It's a nightmare trying to get an appointment,2/8/2021,1,"The reception team can be really rude and standoffish, and it's a nightmare trying to get an appointment. The only problem is the other surgery in Sudbury is even worse, otherwise I'd register elsewhere!"
Siam,I've always had excellent service from all,1/3/2018,5,I have a few health problems and I find whoever I've seen has been very understanding and caring.
Siam,Lack empathy,10/24/2016,1,"I'll only see 2 of the doctors as the others can be very dismissive and lack empathy.  I believe the surgery should've been on the original site it was planned for.  
At times staff can be variable, but I do like the doctor I see"
Siam,Lack of continuity,5/13/2022,4,I phoned to get an appointment today and will be seeing the nurse practitioner who is appropriate for the reason for the visit. At times I do feel some of the doctors could listen a bit more as they tend to assume what the issue is. Not having continuity at follow up appointments has meant differing views and ideas and I feel it has ultimately delayed a correct diagnosis and treatment.
Siam,Like the doctors and nurses,9/16/2016,5,"Getting appointments is not a problem for me and I like the doctors and nurses, they give good explanations. I also like that blood tests are done at the surgery."
Siam,Liked the text reminder,11/10/2021,5,"I like the fact that I got a text reminder that said how much it costs when a patient doesn't turn up for the appointment, a very good idea."
Siam,Long wait due to travel issues,10/24/2016,5,"I like the new building;  lots of room, comfortable.  I like having the magazines as due to the bus timetable I can sometimes have quite a wait before appointment"
Siam,Long wait on the phone,1/30/2023,4,"There is a long wait on the phone to get through and when you do get through and speak to someone I've been told that there are no appointments available and to call back the next day or call 111.  My appointment today was prebooked with a nurse and was fine to get, its the more urgent on the day appointments that have been more difficult.  The staff are great but phoning the surgery is frustrating."
Siam,Lovely and Friendly,3/2/2017,3,The nurse I see is really lovely because they are so friendly.  It's a very busy surgery and I do have to wait sometimes
Siam,Lovely staff,10/14/2021,5,The flu clinic was wonderfully efficient. The staff are lovely and what I've accessed more generally at the surgery has worked very well and I have no concerns about getting an appointment.
Siam,Lovely surgery,6/4/2018,5,Nice local surgery. Always been polite with me. Great to have everything done in the one place. Works well for us.
Siam,Marvellous,10/14/2021,5,Wonderful doctors at the surgery and I have a lot of confidence in the GP I see. All the staff at the surgery are very nice.
Siam,Medical terminology make it difficult,9/16/2016,5,Use of medical terminology can make explanations a little unclear.
Siam,Mixed experience,12/10/2022,4,Its been a bit up and down when trying to get appointments. I've called with urgent issues but at times have been told that the appointment will be the following week which is frustrating.
Siam,Mixed experience but Doctors are helpful,8/30/2018,3,"Doctors are mostly helpful, receptionists have improved and are more helpful than they were. Can understand they are busy but it took nearly half an hour to get through. Call waiting would improve things."
Siam,Mixed Messages,6/4/2018,4,"Theres mixed messages given by reception. Some have said there are advanced appointments available, others not. Getting appointments is difficult and there are times when you are told to call back the next day."
Siam,More routine appointments difficult to get,4/1/2019,4,If they think its an urgent appointment you will be given an appointment. For more routine issues its been difficult to get the appointments and it can mean waiting a week to be seen.
Siam,Mostly seen on the day,12/19/2018,5,I've been with the surgery for along time. You can get through on the phone easily and most of the time you will be seen on the day. I am happy to see any of the doctors and the diabetic nurse has been very good.
Siam,My doctor gives plenty of time,7/4/2020,5,"I have always got on well here, it's a good service. I feel my doctor is very good, he always gives plenty of time, no improvements needed. The staff always seem to find an appointment when I need one and quickly."
Siam,"My doctor is very, very good",7/4/2020,5,"My doctor is very very good, the asthma nurse that I see is also excellent. They also offer the option to speak with the doctor over the phone which can be useful at times."
Siam,My GP has been so supportive,9/14/2018,5,"My GP has been so supportive, Really good-he was so encouraging for me in my efforts to lose weight (in preparation for surgery). I lost seven and a half stones and he told me he was proud of me!"
Siam,Never had a problem,1/18/2022,4,I've had no issues at all getting appointments when I've needed them. When you call reception there's a bit of a wait on the phone but it's not too bad. The staff always do what is needed and they are great so I'm happy with everything and have never had a problem.
Siam,Never have a problem,1/9/2016,5,I get all my medication and never have a problem.  I like the surgery
Siam,Never have an issue getting appointments,7/4/2020,4,"They are very good here, I never have an issue getting an appointment, my doctor is very good and he recently made a good referral for me to go to the West Suffolk Hospital with a heart issue, I have been impressed with them and I can mostly get to see the same GP which is good for me."
Siam,New doctors are very good,6/20/2017,4,"The new doctors are very good, they seem to have more time for you. More transport to help people attend the surgery would be great. The reception staff can be a little dismissive at times."
Siam,New patient,9/29/2022,5,I've recently registered at the surgery and have to say that my expereinces so far have been great and everything has been straight forward and easy to access.  The staff have been lovely from booking appointments through to the clinicians I've seen.  I've been able to book appointments in advance and see the person most suited. Very happy with the practice.
Siam,New patient,12/10/2022,5,I'm a new patient but so far everything has been great here and I've had no problems getting appointments when they're needed. I have a pre-arranged appointment with the nurse for a clinic and this was easy to arrange.
Siam,NHS service refer into a private service,10/24/2019,4,"I don't think its right for an NHS service to refer into a private service such as the Hearing Care Centre, it can be very misleading to patients. Overall this surgery is good."
Siam,Nice,5/8/2015,4,2 days wait. Book online.
Siam,Nice and friendly,3/2/2017,4,The doctors and nurses were very nice to me when I saw them last.  They were very friendly
Siam,Nice new surgery,9/16/2016,5,Nice new surgery but as a non driver it took me 4 buses and 2 hrs for a 10 minute appointment. GPs and nurses at the surgery are good and appointments are easy to get.
Siam,Nice to come here,4/1/2019,5,"Staff are very helpful, its nice to come here, there are no dramas. It might take 3-4 days to get an appointment but if its urgent I will be seen on the day. Liaison between the physio and the surgery has been very good. I did try to arrange a house visit but was told it wasn't necessary and I wasn't offered the chance to talk to a GP even though I was unable to get to the surgery as I was unable to move."
Siam,No air conditioning in the waiting area,10/24/2019,5,I can usually get an appointment here but the bus service is not very regular. I wish there was a walk in minor injuries in Sudbury. There is no air conditioning in the waiting area. The doctors and nurses are good here.
Siam,No complaints at all,12/10/2015,5,I went to see the diabetic nurse yesterday and was seen before my time and was seen and out in 10 minutes. I also had a flu jab while I was there. No complaints at all.
Siam,No issues,12/10/2022,5,I feel that the care navigation works well and getting you to see the right member of staff at the practice. I don't visit often but for this appointment I called and spoke to reception and they gave me an appointment with a doctor which worked really well.
Siam,No issues,10/13/2021,4,"Have had no issues getting appointments lately, you can call and chat to a doctor and then get an appointment to see them, so it works well."
Siam,No issues and happy with appointments,4/26/2018,5,Can get an appointment quite quickly. Tend to book by phone which is easy enough. Generally works well and don't have any issues.
Siam,No issues but communication could be better,4/26/2018,5,No issues generally but I do feel that Doctors are unaware of the severity of the challenging behaviours my son can exhibit and therefore don't communicate well with us at each visit.
Siam,No issues getting appointments,5/13/2022,5,"I asked for a face to face appointment with a doctor this morning and was given one. Generally it all works very well for me as I get to see a doctor when I need to so I have no issues. The care provided is good and the staff are great, very friendly."
Siam,No issues getting appointments,10/1/2022,5,"The phones are quite busy in the morning but I haven't had any problems getting appointments. You can ask to see specific doctors and this does make a difference as the support/ care can vary if you see different people, generally it works very well."
Siam,No problems,8/17/2016,5,I get all my medication when I need it + never have a problem I like the surgery
Siam,No problems and well integrated with VCS,4/26/2018,5,"No problems with the surgery. I can get appointments easy enough. The cardiac nurse has been very good with good links with community services. Good integrated work with VCS, including Onelife Suffolk"
Siam,No problems seeing nurse,1/30/2023,5,I call for appointments and the staff are really good and the system works well. I had no issues getting a pre booked appointment with a nurse today.
Siam,Not all doctors listen,6/4/2018,4,Can normally get an appointment on the day. Quite easy to get through on the phone. Certain doctors can be dismissive and don't listen to what you are saying.
Siam,Not having a pharmacy is difficult,3/9/2018,3,"Its difficult to get prescriptions, going in to town is problematic and it would be better to have the pharmacy up at the health centre where there was meant to be one. I can usually get appointments when you need them."
Siam,Nurses are amazing,12/10/2022,4,Calling the surgery can entail a bit of a wait on the phone but getting pre booked appointments is no problem at all. The nurses are amazing and go above and beyond what you'd expect. They consider everything holisically so the support provided is great. Phone consultations with a GP were a little less good as it has meant that medication was prescribed with out being seen. I've then needed to have further contacts with the surgery when nothing has improved. There is limited continuity but I have requested to see someone specific but it does take more time to see them.
Siam,Nurses are great,1/18/2022,5,I have no problems getting the appointments I need. I see the nurses who dress my legs regularly and they are really great. I find getting to the health centre difficult but understand that that's not something the surgery can do much about unfortunately.
Siam,Nurses friendly,5/9/2018,5,"Friendly staff who listen well to you. They are generally quick to see you and getting appointments is good too. Nurses are good, they're great fun and friendly."
Siam,Nurses good,12/10/2022,4,"Its just the phones which are busy when you try and contact the surgery for an appointment, but when you do get through there are appointments available and you are generally seen the same day in my experience. I tend to see the nurses most and I'm happy with that as they explain issues well and spend time with you."
Siam,Online appointment worked well,1/19/2022,4,"The phones are a bit busy some days but I've had an online appointment using the web cam and it worked really well and actually felt safer than visiting the surgery. I've also had call backs but have missed the last call when I didn't get to the phone in time and was told that I would need to call back to make a new appointment the next week.  The call backs are okay but I do feel they are a bit brief and rushed through and you definitely don't feel I have a personal relationship with the GP. The covid vaccination process rolled out by the surgery has been done very well, can't fault it."
Siam,Online booking is good and GP's take an interest,5/1/2017,4,Using online booking works well.  The doctors take an interest and it doesn't feel you being rushed out.  I prefer the new location.  It's a much better service
Siam,Open and accessible,6/4/2018,5,Quite happy at the moment. Have found the surgery to be very good can book appointments online or by phone which works well. You can see a doctor when needed. A very good surgery.
Siam,Outstanding,10/24/2019,5,The help and consideration given by everyone here is outstanding. The transport to and from the surgery is not easy.
Siam,Overall a good service,6/4/2018,4,"Find it easy to make an appointment, staff are friendly. Generally works well for me."
Siam,Overall good,12/10/2022,4,It's quite quick to get an appointment to see someone which is important and booking appointments in advance doesn't mean a long wait either. I feel that because staff didn't listen to me after an accident it has taken nearly 2 years to be referred for a scan and I now have an ongoing issue.
Siam,Overall good,10/24/2019,5,"It can take a while to get through on the phone, but I've been coming here for many years and overall it is good."
Siam,Pathway to physio flawed,12/10/2022,4,I have an underlying health condition but I have been going round and round in circles with referrals to OT's and physios. The pathway doesn't work well as I have been referred back to the OT's even though I've been with them for years. It causes the surgery more work as I'm now back again for another appointment trying to get it all sorted out again. It would be more efficient with long term conditions or complicated health conditions if you could see the same GP more often as it would hopefully prevent being re referred to the same services multiple times.
Siam,Phone is an issue,11/10/2021,4,The phone line is an issue and I've been cut off while waiting in the queue which is frustrating but other than that the care and treatment is great.
Siam,Phone system needs more indication,6/4/2018,5,On the day appointments are easy enough to get. Tends to work very well for us nothing really needs changing. Phoned today but phoneline was silent with no message or music to indicate whether you were in the queue or not. Explanation about why they are asking for more detail about the need for an appointment would be nice.
Siam,Poor and dangerous diagnosis,10/11/2016,1,"My 24 year old son went to see the doctor complaining of pain which started centrally and moved to the lower abdomen on the right starting the day before.  He was hot and obviousy ill.  Doctor said 97% sure not appendicitis.  If worse contact again in 48 hours.  He did not take temperature or BP or bloods.  It did not get worse.
I called 111 3 days later.  He was admitted and on the 4th day before his appendix was removed it had perforated !!"
Siam,Poor experience.,12/5/2016,1,They sometimes do not even attend when visit requested. Drs have poor attitude. 'Phones often do not work.
Siam,poor location,8/27/2015,3,I do not visit the surgery very often. Last visit not good and location is poor
Siam,Postnatal and baby checks all done,10/1/2022,5,Getting my baby's vaccinations has been fine and I've had all my post natal checks and appointments on time.
Siam,Prescriptions can be a problem sometimes,6/4/2018,5,"They are all so nice, nothing is too much trouble and they listen to you. Very well supported by staff. Picking up prescription means multiple visits to the pharmacy as they ran out at different times would be helpful if medication could all be for 30 days."
Siam,Quick and efficient,10/13/2021,5,The process for the flu clinic has been a quick and efficient process and the staff have been great and so friendly.
Siam,Quick appointments,12/10/2022,5,"I like that you can call and just book an appointment when they are needed. I called this morning and was given an appointment with a GP straight away, which was great. Staff are good at explaining issues, the only slight issue is how long it can take to get through to the surgery in the morning, I was on the phone for 20 minutes this morning."
Siam,Quite easy to get an appointment,10/24/2019,4,I've always found it quite easy to get an appointment. On the whole I am happy with the surgery.
Siam,Real difficulties getting appointments,5/1/2017,3,Real difficulties getting appointments with doctors and nurses. Tried online booking but it didn't work well.  Doctors tend to focus on the computer and can do very limited investigations into problems.
Siam,Really friendly and efficient,4/26/2018,5,Always really friendly and efficient. generally get through on the phone to book appointments ok. Not having advanced appointments does make it more difficult but the staff have been great. I have had difficulties with notes being viewable from Colchester.
Siam,Really great care and support from nurses,12/14/2017,5,Really great care and support offered by nurses at annual LD health checks. Really understanding and patient and discussed delicate issues very sensitively.
Siam,Really great system in place,10/13/2021,5,"The system in place for the flu clinic is great, it works so well and the staff are as lovely as ever."
Siam,Really satisfied with this surgery,4/26/2018,5,"I can always get an appointment, doctors are always helpful and explain things well. Really satisfied with the surgery. The nurses have been very good too."
Siam,Reception always helpful,10/24/2019,5,"The reception is always helpful, if you are pleasant so are they, they should be on better pay! good personal touch. There should be some background music in the waiting area."
Siam,Reception are good,12/10/2022,5,"Reception staff are very good so long as you are prepared to explain why you need an appointment and then you get what you need. The parking is excellent here, but the music on the phone isn't great quality and it comes and goes as it plays."
Siam,Reception are very flexible,6/4/2018,5,"You don't have to wait too long for appointments, reception will squeeze you in if you need to be seen. Not often you have to wait."
Siam,Reception helpful,12/10/2022,4,It has been really good lately to get appointments. I called last week and they were flexible  and gave me an appointment I could get to. Even through the pandemic I had no issues when I needed to be seen.  I'm seeing the nurse who is the right person for the issue and they are great. Reception staff are also friendly and chatty and so helpful.
Siam,Reception staff are excellent,7/4/2020,5,"I've been very happy here, the reception staff have been excellent. I am able to book an appointment when I need one without any trouble."
Siam,Reception staff are polite,1/20/2022,4,"Appointments are easy to get and you can either pop in or call to book them. Reception staff are always polite, kind and listen. All my diabetic checks have taken place as and when they should, the only problem I've had is with prescriptions since the change to the new system. I've had issues with items being wrong but this month it's all been fine."
Siam,Running beautifully,11/10/2021,5,The flu clinic today has run well with no issues. Staff have been really nice and thanks to all the staff for all they do.
Siam,Runs smoothly.,10/24/2016,4,The new centre is better including all amenities and it seems to run more smoothly
Siam,Satisfied with surgery,6/4/2018,5,"Can always get an appointment, doctors are always helpful and explain things well. Really satisfied with the surgery. The nurses have been very good too."
Siam,Seen on time,11/10/2021,5,"The flu clinic has worked really well, been seen on time and thank you for doing it all."
Siam,So many questions asked by receptionists,10/24/2019,4,"It feels uncomfortable to be asked so many questions initially by the receptionists. There is one doctor that I never see as I don't trust them, my concerns were dealt with by the practice at the time. Things do feel a bit slap dash here and I don't feel the care is here sadly."
Siam,Some doctors give more time that others,7/4/2020,5,"I think it would be useful to have a visual screen to call patients through as not everyone has good hearing. Some doctors could give a little more time, some give more time than others. But overall I am very happy with this surgery."
Siam,Staff are great,9/16/2016,5,Staff are great. Appointments are easy to get with the nurses and to see a GP isn't normally a problem either. Transport for people without a car is difficult.
Siam,Staff are very friendly,6/10/2016,5,The staff are very friendly. The booking in computer doesn't always work but reception staff are very good.
Siam,Staff attitude has improved,6/13/2016,4,Since the move to Sudbury Health Centre staff attitude has improved and everything works really well.
Siam,Staff can alternate with approach,6/4/2018,4,"Good to have the building, depending on who you see it does make a difference to how you are dealt with. Generally the doctors and nurses are very good."
Siam,Staff can be mixed,7/27/2018,4,"Its a clean, easily accessible surgery away from town with good parking. Staff can be a bit mixed, medical staff are great but because reception staff didn't listen to what was needed it has meant appointments with the wrong people on two occassions and has wasted the doctors time."
Siam,Staff explain things well,11/1/2022,5,I've had no issues at all getting appointments. I tend to call for them and it all works well. The staff are good at explaining issues and the communication with West Suffolk Hospital's community midwives has been very good.
Siam,Staff have a friendly approach,7/4/2020,5,"The surgery is very good, everybody is so friendly, the approach is excellent, If I have a question they do all they can to find the answer. Staff are so approachable here. We do feel very well cared for. We are actually moving out of the area soon and we will be very sorry to leave this surgery."
Siam,Staff lovely,1/30/2023,4,"This was my first face to face since 9 as all issues have been dealt with over the phone, some have been appropriate but not all.  I was given medication for most issues to see if it would work.  The staff are lovely but there does sem to be a resistance to giving out face to face appointments."
Siam,System works well,1/2/2023,5,I do struggle due to my condition to call the surgery so early in the morning so I have to rely on family to make the call for me.  I have been able to get appointments this way and staff are happy to talk to them which makes appointments easier to arrange. I find the system works well and I don't really feel that there is anything that needs to change.
Siam,The Doctor was rude and uncommunicative.,6/24/2015,2,No one was in the waiting room yet it took me an hour to be seen. How does that work?
Siam,The dr. was brilliant!,3/2/2017,5,"The doctor I saw today was brilliant, very friendly which isn't always the case with GPs.  asked me to get a blood test"
Siam,The flu clinic ran to time,11/10/2021,5,"Pleasant welcome and very helpful, a very good idea to do the blood pressure etc checks. A good experience as a patient - keep up the good work."
Siam,They explain everything to me.,3/2/2017,5,I go to appointments with my support worker.  I am happy to see any of the doctors.  They explain everything to me and my support worker.
Siam,They listen and act on things,10/24/2019,5,"They listen and act on things here, good onward referrals too, very good service."
Siam,They really care for you and listen well,10/24/2019,5,The nurses and the doctors really care for you and they listen well. The only thing is you do have to wait on the phone a long time before it is answered.
Siam,They're pretty on it,1/30/2023,5,"Lovely staff, especially the nurses, who are pretty on it. Although the phones are busy and I've waited up to 20 mins in the past the appointments are available when you do get through."
Siam,Transport can be problematic,6/4/2018,5,Transport has continued to be an issue with attending but the staff are very good and caring.
Siam,Travel is expensive to appointments,10/24/2016,3,"I asked for a home visit but was told I wasn't eligible.  Having so many appointments makes it very expensive getting to and from the surgery.  Getting to appointments by bus is very expensive, especially when on benefits."
Siam,Tried calling but phones were busy,12/10/2022,5,I tried calling but the phones were busy so I decided to come up to the surgery and spoke to reception. They have arranged for me to be seen by a doctor and I haven't had to wait that long either. I've never had a problem with the surgery they including all the staff have always been great.
Siam,Two week wait.,10/24/2016,3,Sometimes a little bit of confusion around procedures.  To see a specific doctor has been at a two week wait but when seen the care and treatment is good
Siam,Unhelpful doctors,6/25/2018,3,Doctors don’t always listen to patients. Especially regarding children .....
Siam,Use online services,11/10/2021,5,No problems getting general appointments. I tend to do things online and it's always been good.
Siam,Very accommodating,5/9/2018,5,"Staff are very good at arranging appointments at times to suit you, very accommodating. The nurse I see is very friendly and approachable. They've been brilliant, they arrange my prescriptions well and are ready when I need them."
Siam,very different experience to normal,5/13/2022,1,I've asked for and been given face to face appointments but I've felt pushed between different clinicians for weeks and don't really feel the issues I have are being addressed. I have an underlying health condition and having treatment for this new issue has meant having to come off my normal medication. Being off it for so long is really having a detrimental effect on my life and I feel it all needs looking at in more detail so I can get back on my medication. Individually the doctors are lovely but with no continuity things have just dragged on and this is so different to the care I normally receive.  I have just raised the issues with the doctor I saw and have been reassured that they will be addressing the issues.
Siam,Very easy,1/30/2023,5,I had a prebooked appointment with a GP today and it was very easy to arrange with reception following a nurse appointment. Its a fantastic surgery where it works very well and the staff are great.
Siam,Very efficient,10/13/2021,5,"The flu clinic has worked so smoothly, it ran to time and was really great. The staff also were very friendly."
Siam,Very efficiently run.,10/24/2016,5,Very efficiently run.  Never have problems getting appointments.  Tend to see the nurses who are great and offer a personal touch.  It would be great to have additional eye services available as outpatients at the healthcentre.  Accessing the surgery especially by public transport is difficult.  The reception computers didn't work today
Siam,Very good,12/10/2022,5,"Everything here is very good. If I need to be seen I've always been given an appointment and I like that I can come to the surgery, speak to reception about why I need an appointment and then get one. Staff are great, they are quick to diagnose issues and I'm happy to see any of the doctors here."
Siam,Very good,10/14/2021,5,The system in place works really well and it all runs very smoothly and on time. Staff are friendly and helpful which is great.
Siam,Very good,11/10/2021,5,"Been very good today at the flu clinic, timely throughout. Well done keep it up."
Siam,Very good,5/1/2017,5,Very good generally; reasonably easy to get an appointment when you need one.  Very helpful staff.  Sometimes explanations are a little limited and you need to know the questions to ask.
Siam,Very good - Doctors are good,10/13/2016,4,Accessing the surgery is not too bad at the moment because we have a car but when we can no longer drive it will become very difficult. The doctors though are good and it's clean and tidy.
Siam,Very good medical care,9/16/2016,5,"The administration is not quite as good as the doctors. The medical care I've received has been very good, they are easy to talk to and very supportive. I called to see if a nurse could dress a wound on my leg and they arranged for me to be seen quickly."
Siam,Very good once you see someone,4/1/2019,4,"Difficult to get appointments and you are told to call back the next day, but it can then take 5 days to be seen. Once you do get in to see someone they are very good. I don't particularly like being asked by reception why I need the appointment. If you are reluctant to say reception staff get a bit tetchy with you. Other than that they do everything well."
Siam,Very good surgery,1/30/2023,5,Excellent surgery where appointments are available quickly on the day or in a couple of days but its always great and the staff are lovely and friendly.
Siam,Very happy,5/13/2022,5,I've been able to get a mix of face to face and telephone appointments which have been appropriate for the situation and I'm very happy with everything here.
Siam,Very happy with the service,6/18/2015,5,"I'm very happy with the service, I can get appointments when I need them. I did have one occasion when I waited an hour for my appointment time but don't know the reason for it as I was on the appointment list."
Siam,Very happy with the surgery.,3/2/2017,5,It would have been nice to be told when my GP retired and who my GP now is.  Other than that I've been happy with the surgery
Siam,Very kind and helpful,12/10/2022,5,Easy to access appointments. I've seen the doctor and then after the diagnosis I've been seeing the nurse. Weekly appointments with the nurse are booked by them so there are no problems getting seen.
Siam,Very pleased however a pharmacy would be good,4/26/2018,5,Always get seen on time and when you call in the morning you always get an appointment. A pharmacy at the healthcentre would be much better.
Siam,Very quick,11/10/2021,5,Attending the flu clinic was very efficient ans nice and quick. Staff were very friendly and chatty.
Siam,Very thorough and reassuring,12/22/2015,5,Very thorough and reassuring.
Siam,Very well organised,11/10/2021,5,The flu clinic has been very well organised and so quick. Very efficient and great staff.
Siam,Waiting times can be a problem,6/4/2018,4,"Easy to register here, phoned to make the appointment, had to hold for about 5 mins. It would be better to be told where in the queue you are."
Siam,Waiting times for appointment,8/14/2015,5,Getting an appointment can take a couple of days
Siam,Waiting times in the surgery can be long.,10/24/2016,3,Staff are great but waiting times in the surgery can be a little long
Siam,Waiting times variable but care is good,12/14/2017,4,Waiting times are variable but the care is good. Some toys for the children would be nice.
Siam,Well organised,10/14/2021,5,"The flu clinic was so well organised and very efficient, I don't think anything could be done to make it better. The staff were very friendly, helpful and made it all go very smoothly."
Siam,Well organised,11/10/2021,5,A very well organised flu clinic which worked nicely with wonderful staff who were very courteous.
Siam,Well organised flu clinic,10/13/2021,5,"The process went well and it was really well organised. I do feel that the blood pressure machine is reading high, I do my own BP regularly at home and it's never been this high."
Siam,Wonderful surgery,12/10/2022,5,Called this morning and been able to get an appointment with a nurse easily. The call back from the doctor happened when expected and I've been given an appointment with the nurse. All the staff are very good.
Siam,Worked well,11/10/2021,5,"The flu clinic ran really well, so quick and thanks to all the staff who were all very nice."
Siam,Works very well,11/10/2021,5,The flu clinic this year has worked very well. It's run to time and it's great that the extra health checks were done at the same time. All the staff have been very friendly too.
Siam,Works very well and nothing needs changing,4/26/2018,5,"On the day appointments are easy enough to get. Tends to work very well for us, nothing really needs changing. Phone today but phone line was silent with no message or music to indicate whether you are in the queue or not. Explanation about why they are asking for more detail about the need for an appointment would be nice."
Siam,Works well,12/10/2022,5,"I have regular appointments with the nurses, and it all works well and it's easy to book the appointments in advance. There are times when it could be a bit quicker when actually waiting to see them, but they are good and will spend time with you if it is needed, so it's to be expected that they could run behind time a little.  I'm happy with the staff and the way they explain issues too."
Siam,Works well,10/1/2022,5,"I have an additional problem and staff are very accommodating and friendly especially the nurse practitioner I see most.  They make me feel comfortable and relaxed no matter the issue you are discussing and look at you very holistically, so I'm very happy.  Even when I have experienced a problem with medications the staff have handled it quickly and really well.  It would be great if a tea or coffee machine was available at the centre."
Siam,Would like more understanding,6/4/2020,4,"I would like more understanding around when I ring up on behalf of my husband and ask to be put through to speak with the doctor, me and my husband do not understand why this is not understood by staff particularly as my husband has given consent for me to speak on his behalf, the front desk staff do not allow me to be put through."
Siam,Would prefer face to face,11/10/2021,4,I would prefer a face to face appointment but do understand why it is limited at the moment. I've had call backs with the doctor that have resulted in a face to face but as a general I'd like to see it return to normal.
Stanton,Portacabin was a brilliant idea.,1/21/2019,5,Closing down Hopton surgery didn't help overall but the new Portacabin has brought it up to nearly where they were before. It was a brilliant idea. I live half way between Hopton and here so I used whichever practice had the first appointment (when there were still two). I can book with the same doctor for a return appointment for the same illness. Overall it is pretty good for me.
Stanton,A very good practice,6/28/2022,5,I've only just joined the practice but I've found this appointment easy to get after speaking to the GP on the phone. I've had a face to face appointment and I'm very pleased with everything so far.
Stanton,A very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,"Very supportive staff and excellent in an emergency, the doctors were spot on on 2 occasions and acted very quickly. It would help to have a text message for when to pick up medication as it would reduce the number of visits to the surgery."
Stanton,A very good surgery,6/12/2021,5,A reliable and caring practice where staff take the time to get to know their patients well. I personally would prefer a face to face appointment but I've had phone consultations and they've worked along with face to face appointments when needed.
Stanton,"A very good surgery, friendly staff and easy to get appointments",4/21/2017,5,A very good surgery with good friendly staff. Appointments are easy to get on the whole.
Stanton,All good,7/10/2022,5,I don't come to the surgery very often but when I do it is all good. I arranged this morning's blood test easily and found it was a simple process to get it.
Stanton,All good,6/12/2021,5,"The triage process works well, you get call backs quickly and actual appointments are available when they are needed too. I've got no issues with the surgery at all and the staff are very friendly so it's all good."
Stanton,All good for us,1/21/2019,5,"I live in Hopton (surgery now closed) and I haven't experienced any problems. It is all good for us, only exception is that sometimes have to wait for a few minutes but that was the same at Hopton when it was open. It hasn't been excessive and given that everything else about the practice is first class we are very happy here."
Stanton,All pretty good,8/24/2018,5,It is all pretty good here. If I ring in for an appointment I usually get one the following day but I do have to ring at 8.00! We live in the village so it is great because there is no travelling involved.
Stanton,All very good,2/13/2023,5,"Appointments are available when needed and staff are brilliant, very helpful and considering the current situation they are doing wonderfully.  There are small issues around medication and appears to be a lack of communication around them.  I have come to pick my medication up but it's not ready when it should be, I realise it's only a minor problem and it appears that the system is the issue, it all just feels slower at the moment."
Stanton,Always find an appointment,11/16/2018,5,"It isn't usual to be seen on time but they always find an appointment if any of my children are unwell. They create and appointment for them and that impacts so I don't mind waiting a few minutes to go in. In fact, this is the best surgery we have ever been at for getting appointments, often on the day. Even routine appointments are within a week. I would also say that nurses are always great with my children at injection times-they explain well and have stickers which go down well!"
Stanton,Always friendly and polite,8/16/2018,4,"Getting an appointment isn't as easy as it was at Hopton (now closed), it can take up to two weeks to get a routine appointment (though I work so it is partly around my availability). They are always friendly, polite and try to accomodate. The doctors explain things really well and I never feel rushed in my appointments."
Stanton,Amazing surgery,2/13/2023,5,"The staff couldn't be more helpful, they probably just need more staff.  They are very supportive and I feel our family has been given amazing support and care by the whole team here."
Stanton,Appointment availability is good,6/28/2022,5,At times you have to go through the triage process and speak to a doctor first and at others you are given an appointment straight away so it all works well. The dispensary does have long waits at times and standing is difficult for me so there have been occasions when it's got too much I've given up and gone home.
Stanton,Appointments ok to get,7/10/2022,4,"I've found appointments ok to get. It would be great to have a covered walkway for patients to shelter under when waiting for the dispensary as currently everyone has to wait out in the open. Alternatively, could a second window be used by patients to drop off prescriptions and one to collect or could a ticket system be put in place?"
Stanton,Appointments when needed,6/12/2021,5,"I find having separate numbers on the answerphone to call a bit difficult and would prefer a system that says press 1, 2 or 3 for different people at the surgery. I do find econsult works really well and have liked using it to contact the surgery."
Stanton,Both practices are exceptional,6/3/2016,5,Both practices are exceptional. I would be concerned about capacity at Stanton (without Hopton) if everyone had to go there as things stand.
Stanton,Both surgeries are great but.....,6/3/2016,5,Both surgeries are great but if all patients have to go to Stanton I would be concerned by potential extra waiting times.
Stanton,Brilliant,7/10/2022,5,"Been here [for many] years and there are lovely staff, they've always looked after me and I can get appointments when needed. Things have settled down now all the building work has finished.  I have no complaints at all with this surgery and don't feel anything needs to change."
Stanton,Brilliant,6/12/2021,5,A very supportive surgery. I'm able to email the surgery and get very quick responses from the doctors.
Stanton,Brilliant!,10/2/2016,5,"The surgery and staff are really brilliant, I wouldn't want to be looked after anywhere else!"
Stanton,Building improvements are good,6/28/2022,5,"The improvements made to the reception area are good, the only issue is that although the front door is automatic the one through to where the doctors are isn't and it's difficult to manage.  I've had to wait 10 days to speak to a specific GP but have spoken to them and been seen  this morning. The doctor has got the ball rolling and is looking in to the issues I'm having and she was a really lovely doctor, very understanding and supportive."
Stanton,Call backs are difficult,6/12/2021,4,Because I work in a job where I can't take phone calls I find the new call back system very difficult. It would be so much easier if I was able to book a face to face or even a call at a certain time. Once I've had care and treatment its all been very good but the system in place doesn't suit everyone.
Stanton,"Caring & considerate doctors, nurses & staff",6/8/2016,5,"Despite an increase in patients due to new homes built in the area and loss of premises in Hopton, my husband was still able to get an appointment the same day when he was concerned about a health issue. The staff here go the extra mile."
Stanton,Difficult in the past,6/28/2022,3,I found it very difficult around Christmas time to get an appointment and was told that they weren't doing face to face appointments which was frustrating.  I called 111 they said to call the surgery but I couldn't get a face to face appointment. Considering everything I'm hoping that it will get easier from now on.
Stanton,Dispensary unable to get item in,7/10/2022,4,"The dispensary have been unable to get the high energy milk in for my baby. We put the prescription on 3 weeks ago but have arrived to pick it up and its not ready and they they don't have any in stock, they are trying to get in for tomorrow. Its worrying and frustrating that we may run out or will have to reduce the amount given."
Stanton,Doctors and nurses very good,6/28/2022,3,"Getting a call back is difficult and this is the only way to get a face to face appointment. The doctors and nurses are very good when you see them. I do also feel that there should be respect from both staff and patients and not just of staff when you are talking to them, it should work both ways."
Stanton,Doctors are all good,7/11/2018,5,"I have been a patient here for about six years and they have always been very polite to me-never remotely rude. Appointments are quite quick, normally 2-3 days but it can be a little longer but never excessive. Doctors are good, really good. It is a nice little village practice, personal and pleasant. Reception staff are always bright and friendly which makes visits that little bit better."
Stanton,Dowdy,11/16/2018,4,The service is fine but the waiting room is dowdy-needs brightening up. I phone for an appointment-always with the same doctor. I don't get asked if it is urgent (though I would tell them if it was) and I usually get seen for a routine appointment within two weeks.
Stanton,Drs and nurses are good,7/10/2022,5,Waiting to collect medication today has been a bit slow and I'm waiting on xray results from August but have spoken to reception and they have explained another test is required and the person who does them is currnetly off. The doctors and nurses you see are good.
Stanton,Drs seem to change regularly,4/28/2017,4,I have been a patient for years and do go very often but the Drs seem to change quite regularly. They all seem very professional though.
Stanton,Everything is average,8/16/2018,3,The doctors appointments are always running late in being called in. I have been late being seen when mine was the first appointment of the day. Apart from time keeping everything else id average.
Stanton,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Very attentive and seen quickly. I find the triage call with the doctor works really well and I really can't fault the surgery.
Stanton,"Excellent care, easy to get appointments and no wait",4/5/2017,5,Excellent care provided.  Appointments easily obtained.  No long waiting
Stanton,excellent other than time,6/3/2016,4,It is excellent other than it takes a bit of time to get an appointment and sometimes there is a delay in the waiting room on the day.
Stanton,Excellent. Doctors listen an spend time with me.,4/18/2017,5,.The doctors really listen and spend time with me.  The surgery does offer a delivery service for medication which is good.
Stanton,Extra 5 miles each way is irritating,6/3/2016,5,The extra 5 miles each way (from Hopton to Stanton) is irritating and parking is much more difficult at Stanton.
Stanton,Fantastic,7/10/2022,5,"Can't fault the surgery. They look in-depth at issues and listen to what concerns are, I can't fault the doctors. Appointments are easy to get, I've been really pleased with how the surgery is and the care they provide."
Stanton,Fantastic,7/10/2022,5,"Really glad to have seen the GP I just saw. We're new to the area and are so pleased with how the surgery have been. They've provided excellent care for my in-laws, very impressed."
Stanton,Generally very good,11/16/2018,4,Generally it is very good here but appointments often run a good bit late. Doctors are very good all round and I see one particular one and she is great!!!
Stanton,Generally working well,6/12/2021,4,"Appointments are available when they are needed and it generally works very well. Going through the phone triage is working well and I've not had to wait long on the phone trying to get through the surgery or to get a call back from a doctor. The staff are always very nice, caring and helpful."
Stanton,Getting a covid vaccination difficult,6/12/2021,5,My wife is more vulnerable due to her health conditions but we were unable to get her a covid vaccination before I was invited for one. Other than that the care provided by the surgery has been excellent.
Stanton,Getting an appointment is good,5/28/2016,5,Overall it's good. Getting an appointment is good but there can be a slight delay in the waiting room as they often run late.
Stanton,Getting appointments is no problem,6/12/2021,5,I see the nurse regularly and she and all the staff are very good. The only issue at the moment is the limited parking due to the building work taking place. I have problems walking and sometimes have to park down the road and then walk in.
Stanton,Good,2/13/2023,4,Generally on the day is a phone call which I don't mind but it is harder to get a face to face appointment now.  It would be helpful to have a rough idea when to expect a call back from the doctor as its not always easy with work. Staff are always lovely but the dispensary can be a little slow with prescriptions.
Stanton,Good surgery,3/20/2017,4,A good surgery.  A shame one has closed.  Doctors have been good at al times
Stanton,got an appointment for today-great!,1/21/2019,5,"I called at 8.30 this morning and I got an appointment for 10.30-great!! I do often have to wait past my appointment time, 30 minutes isn't unusual, I once had a really long wait but that was due to a particular set of circumstances beyond their control and I was told what was going on. One member of the reception team can be a bit off but everyone else if very professional and caring."
Stanton,Great,6/19/2023,5,"The surgery and staff are all great, it works well having the triage process as it saves unnecessary visits to the surgery. It would be good if you could access all patient information records on the NHS App like some other surgeries do."
Stanton,Great service,11/16/2018,5,I have a named doctor and I book and see them because that works well for me..I don't have to wait too long for an appointment and I don't have to constantly explain my illness from the beginning because they remember me. Great Service
Stanton,Great!,6/3/2016,5,It's great but I am concerned that transfer of Hopton patients to Stanton will mean longer waits for appointments and there is not much parking.
Stanton,Happy with everything,6/7/2022,5,Very happy with everything.  Thank you very much
Stanton,Happy with staff,7/10/2023,5,It's totally fine to get appointments and the triage works well. I'm happy with the staff and can't fault the surgery as they react quickly when they need to.
Stanton,Happy with surgery,2/13/2023,5,"Today's appointment was pre booked with a doctor weeks ago and I'm happy to see any of the staff here, they are all great. It all works very well here, everything is explained well and the children are seen quickly when they need to be seen."
Stanton,Helpful staff,6/12/2023,4,There are often long queues on the phone in the morning so I tend to go down to the surgery to book my appointments now. For non urgent issues it can mean a two week wait to see somenone and it would be helpful to know when to expect the call back. Overall happy with the care provided and staff are helpful.
Stanton,Helpful staff,6/12/2021,5,A very good surgery with really wonderful polite and helpful staff where appointments are available when needed. Brilliant!
Stanton,Highly impressed,6/28/2022,5,I didn't have to wait long for the appointment to have a blood test I only arranged it late last week. It's a perfectly great surgery with wonderful staff. With the dispensary it would be great if they could tell you if medication is in short supply and the full amount isn't in your bag when you pick it up it would then mean they don't get called asking when to expect it.
Stanton,I am very pleased with how I am looked after,1/21/2019,4,"I am very pleased with how I am looked after here, all things considered. It is a good surgery for appointments, never more than 2/3 days and often on the day. Doctors are very professional and understanding. My only gripe is that when I come in for my regular asthma review with the nurse, if I need a change to my medication she can't change it. I have to come back another time and see a doctor to get a new prescription. It just seems a shame to need two appointments."
Stanton,I can always get an appointment,8/16/2018,4,"I can always get an appointment when I need one, which is great. Parking can be a bit of an issue. I live in Garboldisham so I have more of a drive now that the Hopton branch is closed but things have gone better than i had expected with all the extra patients who have needed to be assimilated here."
Stanton,I can't believe how good it is.,8/24/2018,5,I moved to the area just over three years ago and registered here. I can't believe how good it is after being at a big practice within a big town. Everyone smiles and it is all so friendly. It is easy to get and appointment when I need one and the Doctors. are all very good.
Stanton,I can't fault reception staff or doctors,8/16/2018,4,"I can't fault reception staff, doctors or nurses but getting an appointment and being seen on time isn't as good as it was before. All the Hopton patients now have to come down to Stanton. The staff try hard but resources are limited."
Stanton,I got an appointment for today-today!,1/21/2019,5,"I rang in and got an appointment for today-today! Chirstmas eve as well, I am most impressed. Actually, this is a great village surgery, I am always dealt with in a very professional and friendly manner. My doctor is so caring and listens carefully to my symptoms."
Stanton,I never feel rushed,8/16/2018,5,I am often late being called in to my appointment but I value extra time when I need it. I never feel rushed during my consultation. Reception staff can be a bit abrupt sometime but I can understand because I see the pressure they are under. I can always get an appointment when I need one but parking can be a bit of a pain
Stanton,I would like doctors back here (at Hopton),6/3/2016,5,I would like there to be doctors back here in Hopton. My wife and I didn't even know Hopton was closing till a letter arrived!
Stanton,Invited in,7/10/2022,5,I've been invited in by the surgery for a check-up today. I've had telephone consultations which do generally work but I do feel that it would be nice to see a GP sometimes for certain things but so far everything is good.
Stanton,It has been excellent,6/3/2016,4,It has been excellent but it feels as if they have taken their eye off of the ball. Now everything is being transferred to Stanton it feels too busy and the pharmacy has been a bit sluggish on repeat prescriptions.
Stanton,It has worked out well,8/16/2018,5,I was really skeptical when I (and everyone else) had to move here from Hopton surgery when it closed but i have been pleasantly surprised at how well they have coped down here. It's just a shame I have to drive now as parking can be tricky. Overall it has worked out well and the Portacabin seems too work well too.
Stanton,It is all pretty good here,8/16/2018,5,It is all pretty good here. It is fairly good for appointments and the doctors are good. I am very happy. Not much here that could be improved!
Stanton,It is really good for me.,8/16/2018,5,"I live in Stanton and it is really good for me. It got quite a lot busier when Hopton surgery closed but I walk to the surgery so the parking issue doesn't affect me. The reception staff are all so friendly, it makes going to the doctors that bit more pleasant"
Stanton,It's always been good,5/28/2016,5,I've never had any problems or issues at all-it's always been good.
Stanton,I've never had any problems,8/16/2018,5,I've never had any problems. They do their best to see you on the day if you are poorly. I really can't think of anything that needs to be improved.
Stanton,Long term conditions well supported,2/13/2023,5,I'm happy that I will get an appointment and when calling the surgery I've not had to wait long which is good. The phone consultations cover the issues well and they're not rushed and have lead to in person appointments too. The staff are very helpful and I feel well supported with my long term condition.  I phone through for prescriptions but have to leave a message. It has improved since last year and I think there are new staff.
Stanton,Long wait for a nurse appointment,6/28/2022,5,"When I called up the surgery to book an appointment with a nurse the booking process was fine but I've had to wait quite a while for the appointment but I don't come much so its not a big problem. The staff you see are good, the only thing I don't really like is that the toilet is straight off the waiting area which isn't very nice."
Stanton,Lovely surgery,7/10/2023,5,I feel the surgery is as good as it could be. The staff are amazing and it all works perfectly for me as I can get appointments when needed and with the appropriate practitioner.
Stanton,Marvellous,2/13/2023,5,"Feel pretty fortunate having this surgery. The people are great and requests are dealt with quickly. I have had to wait 2 weeks for a call back with a GP for a non urgent issue, which was a bit of a long wait. The building is now good but parking can be difficult."
Stanton,Minor surgery,9/5/2019,5,"I had a skin growth removed from under my eye by Dr Redman. Painless, and just over a week later there is no visible evidence of it ever being removed - just superb."
Stanton,Mostly it is good,8/16/2018,4,"I don't come here often but on most occasions I do have a bit of a wait to be seen, which I understand. Mostly the service is good but I was called in for a wellbeing check with one of the nurses (having reached a certain age) and it didn't go well. The nurse knew that I worked in healthcare and (I assume she considered I had better self awareness than the norm) not all of the expected checks were carried out. I didn't have a blood pressure test for example."
Stanton,My doctor is good,11/16/2018,4,"You need to ask the right questions to get a full explanation with some of the doctors, sometimes they feel too rushed. It takes up to a week for a routine appointment with any doctor but up to two weeks for my preferred doctors, who is very good."
Stanton,My doctor is very thorough,8/24/2018,4,I often go in late but that is because my doctor is very thorough and very popular because she is so thorough. In my view she goes above and beyond.
Stanton,No problems,7/10/2022,4,There can be a queue for the pharmacy which can be an issue but appointments are available through the system that is in place so there are no problems.
Stanton,No problems at all,2/13/2023,5,Appointments are easy to get and they've been good with annual reviews and health checks. I have good continuity with the nurses I see and the staff are all really good and helpful. There are quite long queues waiting outside to pick up medication which can get a bit chilly.
Stanton,No problems getting appointments,12/5/2022,5,I call to get an appointment and have never had any issues getting the help I need. The building work is a great improvement and overall it is a great surgery.
Stanton,Not much to complain about,11/16/2018,5,"There is not much to complain about here. It takes up to a week to see my (named) GP and perhaps there is a 10-20 minute delay in being called in. I balance that against being seen in a welcoming, friendly rural practice with competent, professional nurses and doctors. Great Place"
Stanton,Nothing is less good here,11/16/2018,4,"I am a displaced Hopton patient, I have to travel here (Stanton) now which is a bit of a struggle for me to organise. Other than the transport I can't say that much is less good here than it was there."
Stanton,Nurse is brilliant,6/12/2021,5,The nurse I see on a regular basis is absolutely brilliant. Appointments are easy enough to get and it works very well really.
Stanton,Nurses are brilliant,8/24/2018,5,I see nurses more than doctors and I have to say that the nurses are brilliant! Always lovely and very efficient. In fact I think five stars plus would be my rating for all the staff that I have come into contact with.
Stanton,Nurses are lovely,2/13/2023,3,"It's a good surgery. I've arranged an appointment  for 3 weeks time for something non urgent, it is a bit of a wait but fine.  For todays issue which needed addressing I called and was able to get an appointment the same day. I find the surgery is always good and the nurses are lovely, give confidence and the service is always great. I was on the waiting list for a contraceptive implant which took months then when I was in the carpark for the appointment I received a call to say they'd run out during the clinic and had to wait until the next clinic.  In total it took 4 months to get it fitted."
Stanton,Nurses are outstanding,8/24/2018,5,"I can't fault the doctors or the nurse, in fact the nurses are outstanding. It is a very friendly small village/rural practice."
Stanton,One of the best I have been at,11/16/2018,5,I phone in for my appointments and I can usually see my doctor (named) within 4-5 days to a week. I 101% rate this particular doctor. I was at Stanton before Hopton closed and it has got busier but I can't say it has ever caused me any problems. In the past I have lived around the Country and this surgery is one of the best I have been registered at.
Stanton,Online booking works well,6/28/2022,5,I've found it easy to get appointments and then see a doctor. Booking online works well and the doctor I spoke to yesterday booked me in for the appointment this morning so I'm very happy with how its all worked for me.
Stanton,"Overall, pretty good.",1/21/2019,5,"Overall my experience here has been pretty good. Depending on how busy they are you can have to wait, and it has been for up to an hour. It would help if a text or call could be made to let me know and if that isn't practicable I would like to be told by reception when I arrive. I prefer to book in face to face (rather than on the screen) but I feel this is discouraged. I don't like the screen because I feel it isn't sterilised regularly and i don't want to catch anything."
Stanton,Phones are busy,7/10/2022,4,"The phones are busy, I called at 8.30 but there were no call backs available and I was initially told to call back tomorrow but they did then find me an appointment.  The nurse arrranged for various tests to be all carried out during one appointment after they were organised for three separate appointments of three consecutive days. This was so much easier and I was very grateful. Staff at the practice are friendly and have explained issues well."
Stanton,Pleased with the doctor,6/27/2023,4,"I dont have that much to do with the doctors normally but I did see the GP for something, even though it is so time consuming having to wait for them to ring you back in my case the next day which is a bit too long to wait when you are poorly, but the doctor saw me and treated me very well and after a course of medication it sorted me out, I was very pleased with him.  One thing I do find annoying is that you have to give 7 days notice for repeat prescriptions now at the dispensary it used to be only 3 days notice."
Stanton,Pretty good,11/16/2018,4,"I have been waiting for more than 20 minutes today so far. This is only my second visit since moving back to Stanton and re-registering. So much better here than where I was registered in Thetford, it was very poor there. I am seeing the same doctor as on my first visit and I am pleased about that."
Stanton,Pretty good,8/24/2018,4,They are pretty good here. For example if there is anything unusual in blood test results you get a contact (from the surgery) straight away. More on the ball and professional that used to be the case. Nurses and doctors are spot on
Stanton,Quality of service is very good,8/16/2018,4,I have been late being called in but only once. The quality of the service is good-doctors are understanding. Appointments are easy to get. Great all round-especially when dealing with children
Stanton,Really good in that regard.,1/21/2019,5,"I usually have a wait-up to 30 mins or so but that isn't a difficulty. There isn't really anything specific that I would change (though some of the magazines are a bit old now). On the plus side they always find an appointment on the day if one of my children is ill-they are really, really good in that regard."
Stanton,"Really like my GP, can get appointments and good advice from pharmacist",4/21/2017,5,I haven't noticed any difference since the closure of the Hopton Surgery. I really like my GP and you can always get an appointment on the day. The pharmacist has been great too and gives good advice and will always liaise with the GP if necessary.
Stanton,Reception staff are excellent,8/16/2018,5,"Reception staff are excellent but dispensary staff can be a bit rude at times. Early (in the day) appointments aren't too bad but later in the day you can wait a long time after the appointment time. The doctors are very, very good and it is only the odd thing that doesn't go well."
Stanton,Reception very friendly,7/10/2022,4,Have recently moved to the area and all contact I've had with the staff has been great. Reception staff are very friendly. I'm just having a few issues at the moment getting enough of my medication to cover the whole month as I'm currently running out.
Stanton,Staff and doctors are lovely,6/12/2021,4,Appointments are difficult to get but getting to talk to someone about results has taken weeks which has been really frustrating. The telephone consultations have always been on the same day but they don't always address the issues.
Stanton,Staff are all lovely,5/28/2016,5,Staff are all lovely and very polite. Dispensary is very efficient and there is little waiting.
Stanton,Staff great,9/13/2022,5,"Phone contact with the surgery is very good, I don't have any problems getting appointments. It appears after the building work that things are starting to settle. The staff are great."
Stanton,Staff sound like they have smiles,6/28/2022,5,"I'm happy to be at the surgery, they are very good at what they do and staff are helpful, friendly and accommodating, they sound like they've got smiles on their faces when you talk to them on the phone.  the text reminders are great to have for appointments. The surgery is always clean and tidy, would be great if the parking could be increased."
Stanton,Struggled a few weeks ago,2/13/2023,3,"This morning I've spoken to the doctor and now have an appointment which is great, however, a few weeks ago I struggled to get a child seen when we thought they may have Strep throat. We were unable to get one when it was needed and had to go through 111."
Stanton,Struggled to get an appointment,2/13/2023,3,"Called yesterday morning early but was told there were no appointments available and to call 111.  I then called back in the afternoon and was told I would get a call back which happened in the evening but I was driving at the time and missed the call. I missed the next one too as I'd just got home. I tried calling back straight away but because it was after 7pm the message just said the surgery was closed.  This morning I called, spoke to a doctor, had an appointment and now the issue is all sorted."
Stanton,System for appointments frustrating,7/10/2022,4,I find the system in place to get appointments when you know you need to be seen frustrating as taking calls at work is very difficult for me. Its the system that I don't like as the care provided by staff is very good.
Stanton,That is fine,11/16/2018,5,Receptionists can give the impression that they are trying to hurry you along when you call in for an appointment. I always have to sit and wait after my appointment time to be called in though the nurses are better on that front than the doctors.I have a named physician but I prefer another of the doctors here so I always book to see them because I value them highly. I have to wait a few days longer for a routine appointment but that is fine by me.
Stanton,They are very good,1/21/2019,4,"I'm usually a few minutes late going in but not hours. Other than that they are pretty good. Access to appointments is pretty good. This one is a cancellation, I hadn't been expecting to be seen before Christmas (on Christmas Eve). It is all absolutely fine in my experience, especially my doctor who is attentive and professional."
Stanton,This is excellent,8/16/2018,5,"This is excellent compared to my previous surgery. My consultation today was very good. The Doctor has said he will give me a call in a week or so. The reception staff, and the dispensary, are great at arranging things to suit me. I haven't found anything that needs improving here."
Stanton,This is invaluable.,8/24/2018,5,We can always get an appointment when my daughter is feeling poorly and getting worse. This is invaluable as we have been struggling to get her proper support from mental health services for the last five years. The mental health services in West Suffolk are dis-organised and very poor.
Stanton,Triage works well,9/13/2022,5,In the past I've had long waits to get my medication but now I have them delivered to my home it's much easier. The staff are pleasant and I find the triage process works well to get appointments and when I've needed to be seen I've been given an appointment with a doctor.
Stanton,Truly great,6/28/2022,5,I have no problems with the surgery they are truly great with caring and helpful staff.
Stanton,Unable to get a face to face,6/12/2021,4,Up until now the surgery have been excellent but recently I asked for a face to face appointment but was told I was not able to have one. It resulted in me going in to A&E as I was so concerned and was started on anticoagulants straight away. This incident has made me a little nervous about not being able to be seen in the same way as before.
Stanton,Very friendly staff,7/10/2022,5,It's a great surgery. I only use the surgery a little but I'm able to speak to a GP when needed and the staff are very friendly. It works well.
Stanton,Very good,7/10/2022,4,Response to appointment requests is good but I would like some GPs to listen to patients rather than jumping to conclusions when on the phone. Some medications haven't been available at times but its not every month.  By having to talk to a GP on the phone before coming in to the surgery it does slow the process down though.
Stanton,Very good practice,8/24/2018,5,Routine appointments are usually within the week. Doctors can book you in earlier/more frequently. I recently had to have an injection every other day and the doctor booked all the appointments for me. This is a very good practice
Stanton,Very good surgery,8/16/2018,5,This is a very good surgery. They try very hard to make each patient feel individually cared for. The system for reminding me about regular (annual) checks isn't infallible though.
Stanton,Very happy to be there,7/31/2015,5,5 star.
Stanton,Very happy with quality of care,6/3/2016,5,"I'm very happy with the quality of care (Hopton). I am, however, concerned that the closure of Hopton may cause problems as Stanton will not be big enough to cope. Parking will be a nightmare"
Stanton,VERY HELPUL,1/16/2019,5,"Really impressed with my doctor, cheerful and efficient and nearly running on time!"
Stanton,Very nice staff,6/12/2021,5,"I'd rather see a doctor when I can but understand how busy they are at the moment and that I don't always need  to be seen face to face. The staff are very nice and provide great care, couldn't be nicer."
Stanton,Very pleased,6/3/2016,5,I have recently registered at Stanton and been sent here to Hopton for a blood test. Both are very good and I don't mind which one I attend
Stanton,Very pleased with service,5/28/2016,5,This practice was recommended to me and I have found them to be very patient focused. It's very good here. I live 10 miles away and I am happy to to make the drive.
Stanton,"Very professional, first class",8/24/2018,5,"I had a persistent cough and my doctor arranged for me to have a X ray. She picked up that I had an unrelated heart condition which I knew nothing about and I am now being treated for. Great diligence on her behalf. Very professional, first class."
Stanton,Waiting times are no longer so good,6/3/2016,4,Waiting times are no longer so good. A lot of people are are now going to Stanton (with Hopton being closed) and they maybe become overwhelmed.
Stanton,Wonderful,9/14/2022,5,"I've found blood tests quick and easy to arrange and it's a brilliant surgery. Appointments to see a GP aren't a problem either. The doctors, nurses and recpetion staff are all wonderful and have been very supportive."
Stanton,Works really well for me,4/21/2017,5,"A good surgery, which works really well for me. Having the ability to book a future appointment when suits is really great."

Stow,5 star,9/16/2015,5,5 star
Stow,5 star except for the online contact coverage,3/5/2021,5,I never have any problems with Stowhealth - it is 5-star service - except for the online service which is closed down at weekends and Bank holidays.
Stow,A bit stressful,8/24/2019,4,Booked online initially and wanted to cancel it and book another to extend it. But the person on the phone said I couldn't do that. It was a bit stressful but I can only assume the person I spoke to had a lack of understanding of the online system.
Stow,A good surgery,6/7/2016,4,"A good surgery and I like the triage system, it works well"
Stow,A good system,6/17/2022,5,I booked my blood test appointment online via Ask My GP and found it saves time on the phone and is a good system. I've had no issues getting an appointment throughout covid using the system. Medication is all available on time and the staff are really good too.
Stow,A good system which works well,5/30/2018,5,Its a very good surgery and works well having so many other services visiting the surgery for outreach appointments. Like that I can see a doctor when I need them and there are no problems getting an appointment.
Stow,“FEELING PRIVILEGED”,12/31/2018,5,I can’t thank the team at Stowhealth enough for their excellent efficiency and caring nature  EVERY time I have the need to contact them. Well done everyone !!
Stow,Able to get appointment on day,8/24/2019,4,"Able to get an appointment on the day, no issues. Staff always friendly and considerate as I have two small children."
Stow,Access is good,3/30/2023,4,"It is excellent and I have no access issues here. You don't see the same GP twice, but I understand that this is difficult."
Stow,Accommodating staff,3/10/2018,5,"Its a really good surgery, all the staff are so very friendly and great with you. They are all so accommodating  and helpful and I really can't fault anything at the surgery."
Stow,Accomodating staff,2/15/2023,4,"The last few weeks have been good. I've seen a new doctor and she has been very good. I was asked to do an online asthma review but my use of online systems is very limited and I get in a muddle easily. I spoke to reception, explained the situation and they gave me a paper version of the review which was much easier.  I do struggle at times when there is the expectation that everyone is online."
Stow,Accomodating staff,12/3/2019,4,I rarely use the surgery but it's ok when I do. I needed to come back for a  routine test and staff were accommodating and managed to arrange it for a day when I work from home which was great.
Stow,All aspects very good,12/16/2019,5,"All aspects of this surgery are very good, they have always treated me well, staff are always very polite. I have no complaints at all."
Stow,All contact has been good,2/16/2023,4,I've been invited in for my annual review and it was easy to arrange the appointment.  I've had good responses through Ask My GP and they've resulted in quick call backs by a GP and have addressed the problems. Its a very good surgery.
Stow,All fine,12/21/2015,5,"Very limited contact, mainly just have my medication reviewed which is fine."
Stow,All good,12/10/2015,5,All good
Stow,always able to see someone,5/25/2017,5,You can always see someone.  Often you will see a different doctor after speaking to your own GP.  It works well for us
Stow,Always been treated promptly and courteously.,7/9/2021,5,The doctors have time to talk to you and follow up services are reliable.  Delivery of prescriptions is excellent.  However I do find the online service a bit confusing and miss being able to book my own blood tests.
Stow,Always deal with my requests/queries swiftly,9/18/2021,5,Always deal with my requests/queries swiftly & in a professional manner
Stow,Always highly efficient and supportive.,8/17/2020,5,"I have been a patient here for 20 plus years. I have always found all staff to be friendly, efficient, supportive and informed. 
The ongoing service offered during these uncertain times has been first class. Very well organised!"
Stow,Always someone available,8/24/2019,5,There is always someone available to see me. We have had very fast referrals to the hospital when my husband was diagnosed with cancer. I wish the car park was bigger as we often find it difficult to park even though we have a blue badge.
Stow,Always very good,7/30/2021,5,"I think the online service is brilliant. In the old days, you'd phone up and then have to await a call at any time of the day - inevitably when you're in a meeting at work. The online service works so much better - the opportunity to share photos, choosing a call back (specifying your own availability) or email, and being seen on the day if you need it. I am sure there are challenges with it for some members of the community, but this service better reflects the fact that people needing health advice might be working or managing other responsibilities and can't sit around waiting for a phone call. My perception is that the online service is freeing up doctors and nurses to be able to see those who really need it, and there is less time pressure than in the old system."
Stow,Always very helpful.,8/24/2019,5,"Always able to get appointment on the day, they have paediatric nurse practitioners here for my kids which is great. Don't have to wait too long to get in. I really can't think of anything I would change about this surgery. Staff are always very helpful."
Stow,Always willing to listen.,8/24/2019,5,Always willing to listen as I know I can be a bit of a pain with my phobia. Getting an appointment is positive. I managed to ring up this morning and get one. I like this surgery. very much.
Stow,Amazed by the way my doctor has been with me,11/11/2015,5,I've just moved to the surgery and have been amazed by the way my doctor has been with me. Very supportive.
Stow,An ok surgery,6/20/2017,3,The surgery is ok but you do have to wait for appointments as they run behind.
Stow,An outstanding surgery,5/8/2016,5,The surgery is outstanding. The way the triage system works is great and it works so well.
Stow,Annual well man check,12/2/2016,5,"I last saw a nurse for a well man check, they monitor everything annually. After the appointment the doctor called 2 weeks later to let me know everything was fine."
Stow,Appointment making is excellent,12/16/2019,5,"Making appointments is excellent including making home visits, I had to have one this week by a doctors associate he was excellent. I have been to other surgeries and this one is better by far. Issues are always handled and dealt with. I only have one problem - the car park is not big enough."
Stow,Appointment System,3/23/2016,5,"The appointment system is great, phoning in you get to speak to a receptionist, and you can ring anytime, morning or afternoon.  The receptionist will pass you over to the doctor for a quick chat, this is good because it may put your mind at rest and eliminate the need to travel in and take up an appointment space.  If there are any doubt though, the doctor will say come in."
Stow,Appointment system not easy if you work,3/10/2018,2,"The appointment system is very difficult if you work. I can't take calls at work and it is therefore very difficult to arrange an appointment because you have to wait for a call back from the doctor before you can be given an appointment. You're not given any idea when the call will come through or any option when you do finally talk to someone, which can also be problematic when you don't work locally. This time I've had to explain the situation over and over which has become so frustrating."
Stow,Appointment with in an hour,3/10/2018,5,"Phone calls back from the doctor have been very quick, it was 5 minutes this morning and we had an appointment within the hour. I really can't fault the surgery.  Prescriptions are always ready on time which is good but nurse appointments haven't been quite long enough to do the more in-depth treatment needed. I was also given an appointment to see the physio which was really good."
Stow,Appointments,3/23/2016,4,It is very quick to get appointments here
Stow,Appts system generally works well,7/16/2015,4,Generally I go in to appointments late as they are never running on time. The booking system works well for me and I've never had a problem.
Stow,Ask my gp is excellent,9/9/2021,5,This surgery is very organised and ask my gp is an asset
Stow,Ask my gp online only,2/10/2020,1,Receptionists don’t care and just tell you to use ask my GP. Ask my GP is the slowest way I’ve ever had help from a GP as it takes an age for them to reply. An over the phone conversation would be much quicker and simpler.
Stow,Ask My GP works well,6/17/2022,5,I've had a blood test today and last week I had a face to face appointment with a trainee GP.  I would prefer to see my own GP but I'm happy with the care I was given as it feels they have more time for you. All the staff are good.
Stow,Attentive staff,3/10/2018,4,"I've always found it a good surgery. The staff are attentive and will do all they can to explain and sort issues out. The availability of parking is an issue, it can be so difficult to get a space at times."
Stow,Being able to book ahead would be better,2/25/2019,5,"Having everything all under one roof is really good, it makes accessing services easier. They really keep on top of complicated health issues. If you need to be referred to hospital you are and quickly. The staff are friendly and easy to talk to but I would prefer a system where you can book appointments ahead of time as when you have lots of other hospital appointments or other caring commitments its difficult to call on the day and planning ahead would help."
Stow,Better car parking would help,10/8/2015,5,Better car parking would help. Its a very efficient service and provides everything we need at the moment.
Stow,Blood test results,4/29/2015,3,"Getting an appointment for a blood test is easy, its the waiting to get the results, I have my 3rd blood test last week, and every time so far I have had to call back to get the results, I don't mind doing this but it would be nice if they sent a letter and a text or a quick phone call once they have the results, if there is nothing to worry about. Just having to call reception to then wait for the doctor to call you back which could be a day or two later depending whether or not you want to speak to your doctor is just so long winded, other than that the staff are always nice and polite."
Stow,Blood test/Prescription,4/20/2015,4,"Went in for a blood test which was about 10 mins overdue which was fine, on my way to the room and someone come and got me and took me to a different room, the nurse was lovey and everything went well, which is good.
Went down to collect a prescription, went to the wrong pharmacy bit told to go to the boots pharmacy where it was ready to collect, so i walked across the room where i was then told they couldn't find it. They have had a week to sort it, few minutes later, told they had 'tracked it down.' I was there way longer then i needed to be. Other then the pharmacy being terrible, it was good."
Stow,Brilliant,2/15/2023,5,"Ask my GP is quick and easy to use and I've had quick responses too. I'm happy with the care provided and I often get invited in for appointments. I'm happy to see any of the GPs and the staff are all really lovely, friendly and helpful. It all works well for me."
Stow,Brilliant,9/13/2022,5,Always found the surgery to be brilliant and have had good experiences with the doctors. I tend to call the surgery to ask for an appointment and this works well. It would be nice if the doctors listed on the surgery website was updated.
Stow,Brilliant,8/24/2019,5,"They are absolutely brilliant here. Nothing is too much trouble, the GP responded quickly for me in an emergency recently."
Stow,Brilliant care and very responsive,11/2/2021,5,Had a video call with Dr at Stowhealth when I tested positive for CV19 and was quite poorly. Her assessment was brilliant and resulted in me getting the meds I needed to get better. Just so responsive. I totally believe that this prevented me being hospitalised. Thank you so much.
Stow,Brilliant mental health support,9/29/2022,5,"I've recently moved to the surgery and the mental health support offered by the doctor I saw was brilliant. They have been great and made sure everything is in place for me. It's been an absolutely brilliant practice, very understanding and clear. I had tried to get help for a long time before moving to this surgery so can't believe how great they've been."
Stow,Call back by GP works very well,12/16/2019,5,The speed of calling back by the GP works very well and gets dealt with swiftly. Polite staff. The medical staff explain things well. I am overall impressed with this surgery by comparison it is the best one I have every been part of.
Stow,Call back service is not very organised.,3/31/2021,2,"I know you are under a lot of pressure because of the covid situation, however my doctor has been trying to phone me about my blood test Results, as I'm an HGV Driver I Need to know if my blood test Results are not good and is it still safe for me to drive heavy lorries? Ask the gp service is not very good, and call back is no better, please get more organised."
Stow,Call backs from the doctor works well,8/30/2018,5,Call backs from the doctor works quickly and well. Happy with the triage system too.
Stow,Call backs normally quick,12/3/2019,5,Reception staff are helpful when you ring and doctors normally call back within the hour which is good. Generally you then get an appointment that day. This appointment has been pre booked which allows you to plan ahead. Its all quite smooth and works well. Reception will often help with issues but will always arrange a call from the doctor if needed.
Stow,Call backs not always happened,3/10/2018,5,I can get appointments when I need them but there have been occasions when the doctor hasn't called back as I have expected. All medication is ready on time and accuately done too.
Stow,Call backs quite quick,3/10/2018,4,"The staff are friendly, they provide good information about whats happening. Call backs from the doctor are ususally quite quick and you get in to your appointment mostly on time. The car park is difficult to find a space and you do end up driving away to park else where."
Stow,Call backs work well,7/27/2018,4,They respond quickly and the call backs from the doctor works well. It would be better if doctors listened more rather than assuming things. The explanations can be a little limited at times.
Stow,Can always see a doctor,7/16/2015,5,Even if you can't see your own doctor you will be able to see someone.
Stow,Can be difficult to see own GP,3/10/2018,5,"Everybody at the surgery is helpful, I can get appointments whenever I need them. I do tend to come to the surgery to book blood tests. To see a doctor you need to ring and wait for a call back which isn't too bad and you do generally get an appointment. Because my GP doesn't see patients everyday it can be difficult to see her regularly."
Stow,Can feel like you are being fobbed off,6/7/2016,4,The service does vary depending on who you see. At times it can feel like you are being fobbed off.
Stow,Cannot fault surgery,5/25/2017,5,"A really great surgery, can't fault it.  They also deliver my medication when needed and check what I do or don't need"
Stow,Car park is an issue,10/8/2015,5,Car park is an issue. Its fantastic to be able to get an appointment on the day and a doctor calls you back within the hour. Generally happy with the service.
Stow,Car park needs improvement,8/14/2015,5,The only thing I would like to see improved is the car park.
Stow,Carer explains what the Dr says to me.,4/14/2016,5,When I visit I go with my carer and they explain everything when I get home.
Stow,Carpark is a little limited,10/8/2015,5,"Car park is a little limited Dr (name removed) is the best doctor, they explain everything and will spend time with you."
Stow,Choice of booking,2/9/2015,5,"I would prefer to be able to book to see a certain doctor ahead of time, dentists and other services manage this."
Stow,Communication counts,9/1/2019,4,"In March 2018 I became anxious and depressed due to family problems. (Name redacted) prescribed drugs I had been on since 2004/6 and other self managed treatments. Suffolk Wellbeing is understaffed and underfunded. Telephone appointments suffer from too long waiting times for courses and counselling, yet (name redacted) was very supportive of my situation."
Stow,Confident in staff,2/25/2019,5,"Always friendly and efficient and very approachable staff - generally very satisfied. I can book the regular injections I need each time I visit which helps and I'm confident in the staff and information they provide. I like that you speak to a doctor before coming to the surgery as it prevents coming in and wasting time, theirs and mine."
Stow,Consultant didn't acknowledge my concerns,3/23/2018,3,"The whole place in general is very good, you can get appointments when you need them but when you do see someone they don't always listen to the problems you are having. I feel a little fobbed off. Feel the referral process is flawed I get a recurring issue regularly but they won't refer me on to the hospital as it doesn't quite meet the criteria. Because the doctors don't listen I then have to go to A&E who will then treat me, even though my doctors won't."
Stow,Continence service is excellent,1/25/2016,5,I was seen by a nurse and I was encouraged and given hope that my condition would improve and she said Ipswich hospital would give me treatment.
Stow,Covid/Flu Jab,10/16/2022,5,"Excellent, well organised and very friendly provision. Made very welcome by the receptionists on the door and desks. The medical staff were amazing. Thank you everyone."
Stow,Delay in call back is anxiety raising,3/10/2018,3,"I would like the doctors to call me back more quickly rather than keeping me waiting, which makes me more anxious and worried. A doctor who specialises in mental health would help as they would recognise the issues. Medication should be what your psychiatrist has said it should be and shouldn't be changed by a GP."
Stow,Delay in treatment of 3 days,10/29/2015,1,"Resident in care home tested for uti. Sample was sent to Stowhealth.  We were contacted by GP to say she needed antibiotics.  We went to collect prescription and were told it had been sent to Boots MDS.  Rang Boots - they hadn't received prescription.  GP insisted it had been done.  Rang boots on Saturday.  They still hadn't received it. Rang Stowhealth 4 days later and they had found it at the dispensary ""in a bag"".  Patient denied antibiotics for 3 days"
Stow,Dementia services need to be better connected,6/18/2016,5,combined surgery and other services work well but dementia services need to be more connected as in other counties
Stow,Diabetic foot checks are great,6/5/2016,5,I have my diabetic foot checks done here rather than at my local surgery. The care received is great but it would be better to have appointments for my foot and eye checks at the same time to save travelling to them separately.  Parking on site i difficult.
Stow,Diabetic nurse very supportive,4/21/2016,5,My doctor is great and my diabetic nurse is very supportive. If I need to speak to them I can just ring and they will always call me back.
Stow,Difficult to alter and change next appointment,6/27/2017,4,They used to give out appointment card on which they wrote the next date there and then but now they send letter with dates which you have to call to change the date rather than doing it at the time of your appointment.  When you see staff they are great but they just seem to have made more work for themselves.  (Podiatry)
Stow,Difficult to get an appointment,4/8/2017,3,"I had the paramedics out at the weekend and they said that I needed to see my doctor the next day (monday). When I tried to get an appointment the doctor would not see me that day. I called the next day for an appointment and was given an appointment that afternoon, which I was happy with. Getting an explanation of why I couldn't be seen and not being believed by the doctor was not good. Often need written proof from the hospital before they will believe what you are saying."
Stow,Difficult to get appointments,11/11/2015,3,I tend to go to the chemist rather than go to the doctor as it is difficult to get an appointment.
Stow,Difficult/tortuous to access services,2/12/2020,3,By phone takes several minutes to get to receptionist. Piece-meal tortuous and cobbled together website -needs rationalisation. Difficult to know which options work
Stow,difficulty in getting appointment,8/14/2015,4,I called the surgery for an appointment as I was concerned about chest pains but I was told there were no appointments available.  I called back and was given an appointment in a few days.  On the whole the surgery is good.  since returning to the area the treatment for my ongoing condition has differed from where I was but I'mnot sure why.  It is not necessarily wrong but just different
Stow,Disappointing Service,6/25/2021,2,"You are pushing everyone to use the online service, but this can only be used during office hours.
This is difficult for some people who have to work 5 Days a Week!"
Stow,Do a good job,6/17/2022,5,"Phoning up for appointments works well, may have to wait a little while but not bad. Generally have appointments with the nurses which I'm happy with and the staff are really pleasant and do a good job. I've had a referral to the hospital that was done quickly  by the doctor and I couldn't have asked for more."
Stow,Do see trainee GPs,6/17/2022,4,"Ask My GP works well. I do see the trainee GPs and they do need to get second opinions at times and they don't know you're history as well. Because staff don't have time to read your notes before appointments it does mean you end up repeating yourself at each visit. If you were able to see your own GP more it would help, this is more of an issue since covid."
Stow,Doctor has been great,5/9/2018,5,Really like the triage system at the surgery as it means that you don't have to go up to the surgery unnecessarily. The doctor has been great too. I was given options of medication to manage my blood pressure but instead I've lost weight and no longer need any medication. I'm very pleased that I was given the option of losing weight or medication.
Stow,Doctors and Nurses very good,12/21/2015,5,Both the doctors and nurses are very good at explaining things. I have regular diabetic checks at the surgery and everything is looked at and explained.
Stow,Doctors don't always take concerns seriously,7/16/2015,5,As a parent when you raise issues some doctors don't take your concerns seriously and on one occasion after seeing a doctor we had to go to hospital later in the day. Waiting times have been long at times. I've waited over an hour for an appointment in the past which when you have children is quite difficult.
Stow,Doctors will do home visits,12/21/2015,4,I'm happy with the doctors. They come out to the care home to see me when needed.
Stow,Doesn't like triage,7/16/2015,4,"I would rather be able to just 'phone the surgery to book an appointment rather than having to wait for call back, which I missed on one occasion. You can wait up to an hour for the call back and when you're busy it is better to know what is happening and when, so you can get on with other things."
Stow,Doing a good job,1/8/2018,5,"Pleased with the surgery, they are doing a good job. The staff listen well, the triage system generally works and your needs are met. Diabetic care is a little simplistic and the questions are someties not asked. I've had good diabetic foot checks"
Stow,Don't like all the questions,5/9/2018,5,"A very good surgery but I don't particularly like how the receptionists asks so many questions, they want a lot of detail."
Stow,Don't like phone consultations,7/16/2015,4,I find that I'm always offered a telephone conversation but that it is really difficult to get an actual appointment. I don't feel that you can necessarily get the problem across to the doctor in the same way if you're only on the 'phone.
Stow,Don't like speaking to GP by 'phone,7/16/2015,4,Do not like to speak to GP on 'phone instead of coming to speak to GP in person.
Stow,Don't like the triage system,4/21/2016,5,I don't particularly like the triage system as I find it difficult waiting for them to call back but it is a good surgery. They are quite strict about only discussing one issue per appointment. The one time I did try was told I couldn't. I found the surgery very supportive when my husband was unwell and they happily did house calls.
Stow,Don't like the triage system,12/21/2015,5,I don't particularly like the triage system as I would prefer to actually see my doctor rather than just talk on the phone.
Stow,Don't like the triage system.,7/16/2015,4,I don't particularly like the triage system as you have to wait for the doctor to call you back. Getting appointments is not usually a problem and I am normally able to get an evening appointment.
Stow,Don't like the triage system.,7/16/2015,4,"I don't particularly like the triage system in use mainly because I don't feel I explain what is wrong over the phone very well. When people work, the ring back system can be difficult. The nurses can't do enough to help you and are great."
Stow,Dr called back quickly,10/20/2016,5,I called the surgery and was called back by the doctor quickly and invited to have an appointment later in the day.  The doctor arranged for me to go into hospital the next day for x-rays and blood tests
Stow,Dr didn't prescribe the right amount of medication.,9/2/2017,1,"Doctor has declined to prescribe medication for resident. 
I have phoned to Stow health to speak regarding resident patches as we don't have enough to finish this month's cycle. The doctor returned my phone call and said that prescription has been done.  I said yes for next month's cycle and we need to finish this month's cycle and don't have enough.  Doctor said we should speak to Boots. it's your business how you deal with Boots. I tried to explain that doctors hadn't prescribed enough for this month and we can't take from next month yet.  Dr. didn't want to listen and declined to prescribe."
Stow,Dr talks to me,4/8/2017,4,When I go to the doctors I go with my support worker and my doctor talks to me and explains everything.
Stow,Dr's and nurses are good,7/27/2018,5,"You call and get seen if you need to come in, if not it's sorted over the phone. Dr's and nurses are good and it all works well."
Stow,Easy to access the services,2/15/2021,5,Ask my GP gets a very quick response and you can be seen on the same day usually.
Stow,Easy to get an appointment,6/7/2016,4,You can always get an appointment on the day and the doctors and nurses are friendly. I have yearly asthma checks with the nurse and always have my inhaler with me. It's easy for me to get prescriptions too.
Stow,Easy to get appointments,10/20/2016,5,Easier to get appointments than my previous surgery.  Care has been very good and I get appointments when needed
Stow,Easy to get appoitments,5/9/2018,5,I can easily get appointments when I need them and speaking to the doctor before you have an appointment works really well.
Stow,Easy to get blood test appointments,6/7/2016,5,Getting an appointment for blood tests is never a problem and you can either call or have a consultation to discuss the results.
Stow,Easy to get bloods done,2/15/2023,5,Its been easy to get blood test appointments on a regular basis and I feel that staff have been very good to me and can't fault them at all. There have been delays getting my results due to the postal strikes but that's not their fault.
Stow,Easy to use,11/10/2022,5,Ask My GP was great this morning as I got a call back quickly and was then given a follow up appointment soon after. I was very happy with the conversation with the GP and I found it worked very well and was an easy to use system.
Stow,"Efficient, caring and easy to access",1/17/2021,4,"I have never had to wait for an appointment and the flu clinics are so well thought out, even during Covid,very impressed.
I do find that the new AskmyGP system is confusing to use but it has resulted in at least a phone call."
Stow,EStaff are great,2/16/2023,5,"I have no issues at all with the surgery.  Ask My GP is great, get a quicker response using the system. I completed the form last night  at about 5pm knowing that it would be looked at in the morning.  I spoke to the GP and they've invited me in for an appointment which is great.  Using the online option also frees up the phone line for those who can't go online, hopefully making it easier for them.  Staff have been great and I'm very happy with all the care and support provided."
Stow,Everyone was helpful!,2/27/2019,5,"Having registered with the practice late last year after a move from the London area I was impressed with the approach of both the lady who took my initial call - friendly and helpful - and the doctor who subsequently called me. The doctor immediately made two suggestions, one of which had been explicitly rejected when I asked about it at my previous practice. Overall a very positive experience that came as a pleasant surprise."
Stow,Excellent,10/10/2022,5,"No problems at all. Ask My GP works really well and gets quick responses and addresses the issues.  Very happy with staff too, it all works very well and I've have quick referrals and treatment."
Stow,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"I prefer to use the phone to contact the surgery but I do use Ask My GP at times and it's quite simple to use. I get to see my great doctor on the whole for most appointments which I like. I have also seen a trainee GP who was brilliant, they had such a great bedside manner, really impressed."
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2019,5,I find the staff very helpful and they are very good with me and my children. Excellent service here. I always get the consistency of the same medical professional.
Stow,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,When phoning for the children we get seen within a couple of hours.  Great that scans could be done at the surgery too.
Stow,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,Parking is an issue.  Ca't complain.  Can get an appointment with someone
Stow,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,Don't normally have trouble getting appointments.  Phoned this morning and given an appointment within 2 hours after talking with a GP.  They are great with children.  I wasn't aware of the online booking; maybe it should be pushed more
Stow,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,You can always see someone.  It's generally good surgery and we've never had a problem
Stow,Excellent,8/31/2017,5,"Really can't fault the surgery, the only issue is the parking is really not good.
The call back system at times means you have to wait a long time for the call and I've called back to chase it in the past."
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,"Appointments are easy to get, never have a problem.  Staff are normally caring"
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Good that you can get appointments when needed.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Can get appointments when needed  not so much continuity but you can arrange to see your own doctor when needed.  The system works well including the triage.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Every time I've come I've been well looked after and cared for.  It's good to have the outreach services at the surgery.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,They guarantee to see you.  Very efficient and caring.  Having the hospital outreach services is great and you feel very connected to the hospital.  The dispensary is very good too.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,"Great nurse led care, which relieves GPs.  Good surgery with the ability to have hospital outpatient appointments."
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Been good. Luckily I don't come often but when I've rung for an appointment I've got one. Very different from my last surgery.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,A brilliant service.  Can easily get in touch with them and get an appointment.  Excellent
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Never had any problems. Good with children
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Rang this morning and will be seen today.  The triage system works well. Nothing really needs to change.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,Very good. You phone up and get an appointment; they open up early. Generally very happy. They listen to you well.
Stow,Excellent,8/24/2017,5,"The surgery works well, including the triage system. It's easy to get support and the staff are good."
Stow,Excellent,4/18/2017,5,Can't fault the surgery.  I use them very little but when I do there are no problems.
Stow,Excellent,4/18/2017,5,The service works well for us and when we've been referred to hospital it has all happened quickly
Stow,Excellent,7/3/2017,5,Triage system works very well for me.  I like being able to talk to someone and not have to go in for an appointment that's not needed
Stow,Excellent,8/12/2016,5,The triage system has worked very well but it's not as personal as some small surgeries
Stow,excellent,9/14/2017,5,The last few weeks I've been very impressed.  I called the surgery to ask for a memory test and was called back quickly with an appointment.  The whole process has been really good and they have arranged follow up appointments for me
Stow,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Always been seen promptly & always looked after;  no faults at all
Stow,excellent,9/14/2017,5,T.hey are a friendly practice - never had a problem.  Especially if you are working the triage system can be time consuming and not great as you have to wait for the dr.to call.  Sometimes it would be nice to be able to book an appointment when I would like one
Stow,Excellent,6/7/2016,5,I have regular blood test at the surgery and as with everything there it's excellent
Stow,Excellent,11/27/2015,5,In an emergency I went up to the surgery when I was concerned about my child and I was seen straight away
Stow,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,"the change to the triage system that enables same day appointment works well. I like to see the same doctor for the same issues but I don't expect to see one doctor all the time.  Using the screen to let patients know how far , roughly, doctors are running behind would be good."
Stow,excellent,8/14/2015,5,You never get to see your own doctor.  If I had a longterm condition this might be an issue as you would need to explain conditions from the beginning. Handover of patient details is not always great. My daughter had a sickness and diarrhoea problem so we went to the pharmacy for diorolyte but were told she should take immodium.  She took this but when we saw our doctor they said she shouldn't have taken it.
Stow,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,Even when pressed for time the doctors will always spend time talking to you about what is wrong
Stow,excellent,8/14/2015,5,"Sometimes I have to wait for my appointment, up to 20 minutes has happened in the past.  The triage system at the surgery works well;  being able to speak to the doctor and get an appointment on the same day is great"
Stow,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,"Never have any problems getting appointments.
Podiatry service @ stowhealth.  I'm seen about every 2 months by the service,  The other day I forgot to attend an appointment.  I sent an apology and when I called up to re-book they fitted me in the next day.
Staff are always polite and are really helpful."
Stow,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,I don't feel there is much the surgery need to improve upon.  I get to see my doctor most of the time.
Stow,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,"Excellent service, very informative.  I particularly like the triage system as it means you only come in if you really need to."
Stow,excellent !!,10/17/2022,5,contacted Out of Hours at 7-45 and was phoned by the doctor at 8-15.  Had a morning consultation and was back home with a prescription by midday.
Stow,Excellent but parking is an issue sometimes,7/16/2015,5,Nothing is too much trouble and everything is spot on. We can always get an appointment on the day we need one. The parking can be an issue sometimes especially considering that there are only four disabled parking bays.
Stow,Excellent but some problems with home visits,9/10/2015,4,They provide an excellent service. Occasionally do not visit when I feel that is necessary.
Stow,Excellent but training for all GP's in East Suffolk meant I couldn't get appointment.,4/18/2017,5,When practice training takes place all at the same time across East Suffolk it makes it difficult to see a doctor at your practice.  We had to phone 111 to get the support we needed.  It was a convoluted way to get the help we needed.
Stow,Excellent care,7/8/2022,5,"Care provided is excellent, you feel you can talk to staff. Explanations about care and next steps are good the only thing is that the carpark isn't big enough for patients."
Stow,Excellent except for parking,8/14/2015,5,"Staff have always been very good, helpful and friendly.
Parking can be an issue as the surgery is so busy.  Having all the different services on one site is really useful"
Stow,Excellent except some problems with parking,8/14/2015,5,"Car parking at certain times of the day is a problem.
The system from my point of view works well and I've had no trouble getting appointments"
Stow,Excellent nursing and GP.,7/16/2015,5,The nursing team have been truly excellent and my doctor has been great too. I don't feel rushed in appointments. The only issue is the parking and I feel that only patients should be allowed to park there.
Stow,excellent overall,8/14/2015,5,"sometimes the waits to see a GP are quite long.  However, for blood tests they run on time& are brilliant.  Being open extended hours would help to fit appointments around work.  The regular blood tests done by the nursing team are very good and efficient. 
The carpark could be improved but I've just bought a bike and I understand there are bike racks available."
Stow,Excellent 'phone in system.,4/18/2017,5,Really like the way we 'phone in and talk to the doctor.  I was skeptical but it works brilliantly.  It has also reduced the number of unnecessary visits.  You then get to see the doctors really quickly if needed.
Stow,Excellent service,1/17/2022,5,"My daughter has Type 1 diabetes which was diagnosed very quickly thanks to the great team at Stowhealth.  We had an initial telephone conversation, an hour later we were at Stowhealth and then on our way to Ipswich hospital. Very supportive team at Stowhealth"
Stow,Excellent service,3/30/2017,5,Really great service.  Saw my daughter.  Very pleased with the doctor we saw.  They swabbed her throat and gave her antibiotics.  Great service
Stow,Excellent service,7/10/2015,4,They provide an excellent service. I occasionally do not visit when I do not feel it's necessary.
Stow,Excellent service,6/18/2016,5,"Overall, I think it is excellent. The GP's have been very supportive and understanding of my daughter's and our families needs. They keep us well informed."
Stow,Excellent staff,7/16/2015,5,When I ring up for my mother the staff always do all they can to sort out the problem we are facing.
Stow,Excellent surgery,1/17/2022,5,I have been with the surgery 4 years and the care there is excellent. I am always able to get an appointment and have often been seen in person even if I said I didn't mind just a phonecall. All the staff I have encountered there are dedicated and professional. I felt well cared for during my pregnancy which was during the pandemic.
Stow,Excellent surgery - but the website not so,12/5/2022,4,"The surgery, staff and most facilities are beyond reproach.  Unfortunately, perhaps due to the long standing NHS cuts, some useful services have ended. Unfortunately the website has been changed and no longer gives access to one's health records (unless I am mistaken).  It should be possible to register a request even if the surgery is closed until Monday."
Stow,Excellent triage system.,7/16/2015,5,The triage system is excellent and it has been a good idea. It has helped me to reduce the number of people not attending appointments. The doctor has referred me to see a Consultant - this was very efficient.
Stow,Excellent urgent care.,12/17/2015,5,In an emergency I went to up to the surgery when I was concerned about my child and I was seen straight away.
Stow,"Excellent, 'phone in system works well.",4/18/2017,5,You come in after speaking to the doctor and are seen quite quickly and treatment explanation has been good.  I get to see who I need to when I need to.
Stow,"Excellent, very efficient.",1/11/2016,5,Received a text asking me to call surgery.  Contacted them and received call back within 20 minutes from GP.  Within 30 minutes follow up made.  Extremely efficient and very helpful.  Could not ask for a better service.  Thank you.
Stow,"Excellent, well supported by staff.",4/18/2017,5,The triage system works well and I feel very supported by the staff I see.  I have a complicated rare condition and although it has been a learning curve for us they have supported me well.
Stow,Excellent.,4/18/2017,5,The surgery has been good for me and works well when I need to use it.
Stow,Excellent.,6/19/2019,5,"Excellent care, promptly seen by Dr and tests arranged quickly."
Stow,Fabulous,10/10/2022,5,They will always see you and will contact you when you need to talk . Staff are very pleasant . It took a while to get used to Ask My GP. It is important to see a clinician as I called last week and they were treating me for something to what they now believe it is because they have now seen me.
Stow,Face to face appointments available,11/10/2022,5,I haven't found anything thats not done well. Ask My GP works well and you get good responses and feedback through the system and then face to face appointments are available when they are needed too.
Stow,Fair,3/10/2017,3,"My care re my mobility/lymphoma has been sadly poor.  Not invited to come to the surgery after phone appointment;  told it was odema due to weight (obese) not invited in to see hard leg.  Now diagnosis has found out my difficulties in trying to lose weight for my my knee op was a fluid blockage at the knee - painful.Physical understanding showed up problems.  Now suffering with leg, totally bandaged due to blistered skin, now infected as well"
Stow,Fair,8/24/2017,3,I don't particularly like the phone system.  You tend to get diagnosed over the phone and can't always hear the doctor.  You tend to get signposted to other sources of treatment and not getting an actual appointment can be difficult
Stow,Fair,7/3/2017,3,I don't really like having to phone up and wait for a call back from a doctor.  It makes it more difficult to get an appointment
Stow,Fair,7/3/2017,3,I would prefer to see my own doctor more and have better continuity which would make appointments quicker and easier for everyone
Stow,Fair,7/3/2017,3,I find it difficult to get an appointment with my doctor as the system in place actively tries to stop you coming in to the surgery
Stow,fair,10/10/2016,3,I do find it difficult to engage with the reception staff.My medication reviews were done by phone so I hadn't seen my doctor for some time.  The nurse was very good at explaining and was happy to answer the questions I had. Once you get in to see them it works ok
Stow,fair,6/21/2016,3,"Urine not being sent to the lab.
Urine samples of one of the residents at Cedars was sent at 3 different times and when we chased the results we were told that they had not been received. I do not know about it.  The Ipswich hospital is unable to provide results because they didn't receive any samples."
Stow,fair,6/21/2016,3,We wanted an appt. with a doctor but the only appts I can get are with the nurse.  It's been 3 years since I saw a doctor & when you go through the triage system it feels like you are being fobbed off.  I have ongoing conditions and would like to see a doctor .  It's a bit like a brick wall
Stow,fair,6/21/2016,3,The desk at reception is too high for me
Stow,Fair but hard getting to see GP with triage system,4/24/2017,3,It's very difficult to get to see a GP using the triage system and they put it back on the patient by asking if you need to be seen.  Haven't seen a doctor in ages just get to see a nurse
Stow,Fantastic,2/15/2023,5,No problems here at all. My long term condition is well managed and I'm contacted for reviews and tests when they need to be done.  Mostly I see one of the great nurses but I have seen the paramedic and they were great too.  Care and treatment are excellent but it would be nice at times to be able to speak to or see a GP but it is normally quick and easy to get issues dealt with when they arise.
Stow,Fantastic except for repeat prescriptions,8/14/2015,5,Repeat prescriptions seem to go wrong when they are done on the computer system or if requested by other professionals.  Other than that fantastic
Stow,Fantastic service,7/16/2015,5,Fantastic service.
Stow,Faultless.,7/16/2015,5,"I can't find fault with anything at the surgery, they've been great."
Stow,Feel access is being denied to services,12/21/2015,5,Sometimes I feel that I am not being allowed access to services even though I should be entitled to them.
Stow,Felt was being pushed away.,7/16/2015,4,Around family health issues I've been told that the school nursing team would be the first point of contact for issues rather than going to doctor first. But due to the severity I thought it would be more appropriate for the doctor. It felt like I was being pushed away.
Stow,First class.,7/16/2015,5,First class.
Stow,five star,8/14/2015,5,five star
Stow,Four star,7/16/2015,4,Four star
Stow,Friendly and accommodating,12/1/2017,5,They are always friendly and accommodating and will do al they can to help you out
Stow,Friendly staff,11/10/2022,5,"The staff at the surgery are friendly and appointments run pretty much to time. Ask My GP means  you get quick  answer or call back and the issues are resolved. If you feel a face to face appointment is needed then you get it, there's no problem there."
Stow,Friendly staff,10/10/2022,5,"I only use the surgery lightly and mainly visit with the children. Ask My GP is easier than phoning, the timings can vaary for a response depending on the reason for contacting the surgery. It generally works well and the staff are friendly."
Stow,Friendly Staff,7/27/2018,3,It's ok to use Ask My GP but I really would prefer to have a face to face straight off. I've been seen quickly today but I'm not seeing my own GP as I would prefer. I feel that the surgery is still not quite back to normal after covid due to the multiple steps you have to take to get an appointment at the surgery and I don't really see any difference to how it all worked at the height of the pandemic.
Stow,Friendly staff,2/25/2019,5,"It's easy to get appointments, the only issue is that you do have to wait for the call back from a doctor even if you know you will need an appointment. The staff are friendly and helpful."
Stow,Friendly staff,9/8/2018,5,"Friendly staff and a comfortable waiting area. Its good to have the blood pressure machine in the waiting area, very useful. The dispensary looks much better to access now with the changes. The car park can be difficult at peak times and the drop off area is very confined and you can't get out of the way easily."
Stow,Friendly surgery,6/22/2018,4,A very friendly surgery and staff are happy to help.
Stow,Frustrating,1/27/2021,1,"Unable to simply book a time slot/appointment for cervical screening. Would put many people off in bothering. Will have to call but know that it will be greated with ""why didn't you use the app and online service?!"""
Stow,General Comment,3/23/2016,5,A really good surgery
Stow,General Healthcare,11/22/2020,5,"I have been a patient at Stowhealth since 2010, my experience has been about many different aspects of physical and mental health care. My doctor was recommended by my previous GP when I was telling them that I was going to be moving from their practices boundaries. 

I can honestly say that it has been easier to have contact with my GP since they started the telephone triage system, I also find the new option of conversing via messages since Stowhealth changed over to the Ask my GP system, the only way I feel it could be improved would be to be able to send a request over the weekend ready to be picked up on a Monday morning."
Stow,Generally happy,9/10/2015,5,The plug in the toilets was missing. The triage system used is very rational and prevents having to attend the surgery all the time. I've been referred to the physio by the surgery rather than seeing the doctor first and this has worked well.
Stow,Generally happy with care,8/30/2018,5,You don't get to see the same GP all the time so it feels like you are just being seen quickly to get you through. The triage system is mixed as it works generally but on some occasions it doesn't and I've not been given an appointment when one was needed.
Stow,Generally happy with the surgery,8/30/2018,4,Generally happy with the surgery but have not been offered language line.
Stow,Generally very good and helpful,8/5/2015,4,Generally very good and helpful however it is sometimes very inconvenient not to be able to book an appointment ahead for routine check-ups.
Stow,Generally very poor,12/31/2020,1,"Before Covid it was difficult to get a face to face appointment with a doctor.  AskmyGP is not very good and receptionist giving health advice....not sure that is appropriate. This surgery has got gradually worse and lazy over the years.
Obviously,  too many patients on your books and less time for good old fashioned face to face personable doctoring."
Stow,Generally works well,9/14/2018,5,You get to speak to a doctor and get an appointment when you need one. Staff are friendly and helpful. Generally everything works well for us.  Very good explanations by practitioners
Stow,Get appointments quickly,12/3/2019,5,Anytime I've had any problems they always get you appointments quickly. Happy to see one of the nurses who are lovely. The asthma clinic for our son is very good they add some fun to it to make it easier for him. I have had an administrative issue where referral paperwork was returned to the surgery but was not actioned for some time.
Stow,Get to see the same doctor,3/10/2018,4,I get to see the same doctor regularly which I like but if I need to see another doctor that's ok too. You get a call back in the morning normally with in about an hour which is good but in the afternoon it may be a bit longer. Staff keep you informed so you know what to expect and they are always polite and professional and explain things well.
Stow,Getting to see own dr is difficult,10/8/2015,5,Getting to see your own doctor is difficult I don't know when I last saw mine. I feel I am missing a little bit of continuity. I only try to get an appointment if I really need one but I don't particularly like the triage system which seems to make it a little more difficult to actually get an appointment. You don't get to speak to your own doctor so they don't know your history. If I need to make an appointment for my husband because he is at work I can't because they have to speak to him before offering an appointment.
Stow,Good,8/24/2019,5,The appointment system works well here. A good surgery.
Stow,Good,8/31/2017,4,"Seeing my own doctor is a problem.  I'm always given someone else to see.  If you need an appointment they do try to fit you in, but it would be nice to see my own doctor who knows me"
Stow,Good,8/31/2017,4,"Getting to see your own/same doctor is difficult especially with ongoing issues.  I had a particular issue recently and staff were brilliant in getting me a referral to the hospital quickly.
It's a nice surgery but appointments do run late at times"
Stow,good,8/31/2017,4,I like the appointment system; always means you get to see someone on the day.
Stow,Good,8/31/2017,4,"A bit hit and miss at times. Midwives have been good; good they are local.
Have had an issue with the phone triage system when I wasn't back by a GP.
Suggestion: Improve the information on the website about GP specialities"
Stow,Good,8/31/2017,4,The reception staff were very helpful when I had trouble and they made sure I was seen.  I've had good support from the GPs recently
Stow,Good,12/14/2016,4,"When I see the doctor I go with my support worker and the doctor tries to explain everything so I can understand,  I do see a different doctor each time I go"
Stow,Good,8/12/2016,4,Pretty good.  Can get appointments when needed
Stow,Good,8/12/2016,4,"Return call from doctor within the hour.  Query related to partners' alzheimers  night time walkabout.
Doctor referring to Stowhealth's dementia team for help and further guidance.  Excellent"
Stow,good,10/10/2016,4,Very thorough.  I was not kept waiting long. Doctor was training so kept me waiting as she asked for secondary advice but she was very thorough and cared about her patients.  Better to be safe than sorry!
Stow,Good,8/15/2016,4,Depending who you see it can change the information you get and the explanation.  On occasions I've tried to get a home visit but have been told I have to go into the surgery.  The triage system at least allows you to speak to a GP on the day.
Stow,Good,11/27/2015,4,good overalll
Stow,Good but can feel rushed,5/13/2019,5,When I had my 6 week check with the doctor it did feel rushed and I didn't get to ask all the questions I wanted to. Generally it has worked ok in the past but I didn't realise you now have to wait for a call back from the doctor to be triaged until today which I can see being difficult for me in future when I'm back at work.
Stow,good but parking not always easy,8/14/2015,4,Car park needs improving.  I see the nurses more than the GPs and they are very good
Stow,Good but problems with treatment,7/3/2017,4,Thyroid injections were previously given monthly but now every 3 months.  The problem with that is that you get a tailing off of the effectiveness of the drug which impacts on my life.  It's taken months to get a diagnosis as I never saw the same GP
Stow,Good but some visits are unnnecessary,3/10/2017,4,Almost feels like you are having appointments unnecessarily at times and also asking elderly people to come to the surgery for unnecessary visits is difficult for them.  Care is good and nurses are always great
Stow,Good care provided,5/30/2018,5,Good care but it can be difficult to get an appointment if you work as you have to speak to the doctor before you can be seen.
Stow,Good continuity of care.,7/16/2015,5,I feel that I get good continuity of care and I'm able to see the doctor of my choice. Mondays are generally busier so I'd avoid 'phoning on a Monday morning.
Stow,Good doctors,7/12/2017,5,The surgery and doctors are good but the reception desk is quite high for me.
Stow,Good explanation,11/11/2015,5,My doctor is very nice and explains everything to me. I always feel able to ask questions
Stow,Good explanations given,3/10/2018,5,Its a light and airy surgery where staff are happy and they give good explanations when they are needed. They've got a good system in place so you can get appointments when you need one.
Stow,Good home visits,8/10/2015,5,When needed the doctors visit me at home when I'm unwell.
Stow,Good medical team,12/16/2019,5,"I feel more cared for here than in a previous one. The medical staff are good and also the front desk staff are very good. You get a choice of which GP you see, I feel well cared for here."
Stow,Good nurse,12/3/2019,4,"Nice friendly people at the surgery. I had a diabetic check arranged very quickly, six monthly checks could be more regular, I still have my feet checked and the nurse I see is good."
Stow,Good responses,2/16/2023,4,"I've had no problems at all. The responses when using Ask My GP are quick good and importantly on the day. I mainly need nurse appointments and they are great, they manage everything really well, however, there are times when it would be nice to discuss things with my own GP. Overall staff are good and everything works well. I've only had one occasion when I didn't feel a locum really addressed the issue I had, other than that I think its a great surgery."
Stow,Good service,9/3/2022,4,"Have always been able to get a response quickly using the online system. It could be better, in that you should be able to log a request, even if it isn't seen until Monday."
Stow,Good service,3/14/2019,4,"Everything is fine , they provide a good service. The only issue has been that letters from the hospital haven't been read so when I've tried to get medication they haven't allowed me to have it. Other than that it's good,I normally get to see the nurse and this has worked well. Phoning in the morning works okay,it does mean that you don't talk to the same doctor though."
Stow,Good Staff,10/10/2022,5,Today I've been booked in for a blood test which was in advance and not difficult to get. Reception and Healthcare Assistants are lovely and friendly. I don't use online so have called for appointments and this has worked. I haven't seen a doctor for some time but have found the telephone consultation last week sorted out the issues I had.
Stow,Good surgery,2/15/2023,4,I can book blood tests easily and my diabetes is monitored well. Because results are needed in time for hospital appointments the surgery make sure everything lines up for me. I feel they are currently managing my conditions well.
Stow,Good surgery,5/30/2018,4,"A good surgery, the triage system works for me and its good that you get to speak to a doctor and are given an appointment only when needed."
Stow,Good surgery,9/13/2022,5,The surgery is very good and doctors spend time with you. I have regular blood tests but can always get appointments when I need them.
Stow,Good surgery,11/2/2016,4,Generally a good surgery and can get appointments when I need them
Stow,Good surgery generally.,4/18/2017,4,A good surgery generally but if the NHS is under resourced they won't be able to check all the people who need the screenings for different conditions.
Stow,"Good surgery, no problem getting appointments",4/10/2016,5,The surgery is good. The triage system used allows you to speak to a doctor and only have an appointment if necessary. I've never had to wait more than an hour for a call back and generally its with in about 20 minutes. I have just been told my GP is reducing his list which is a shame but I've already seen the GP I've been allocated and I was happy with the appointment.
Stow,Good system in place,2/26/2019,5,Spoke to the doctor and rather than seeing them they arranged for a blood test which was great as they needed the results before seeing me. The doctor explained the process well and I have to wait for the results and then arrange an appointment. I felt well listened to today and nothing else at the surgery is a concern.
Stow,Good triage,5/13/2019,5,"Generally good, the triage is ok but getting a call back when you work can be difficult as you often have to drive back quickly to get to an appointment on time."
Stow,Good triage and care,10/12/2017,5,The triage system works well and care has been good
Stow,Good triage system,2/9/2015,5,"It's really good that you ring to speak to your own doctor and they ring you back exactly when they say they will to discuss the issues. They have been excellent, very good at explaining everything to us. Prescriptions are all managed and they are always ready on time so there is never a problem."
Stow,Good.,7/16/2015,5,Good
Stow,GP very helpful,7/23/2015,4,"My doctor phoned me on his day off with the results of tests that had been done, which was very nice. Sometimes the doctors use medical terminology and don't explain the terms well enough."
Stow,GPs didn't listen,7/14/2015,3,My son had chronic tonsilities when he was young + i didn't feel that the gps listened to my concerns. He was given antibiotics but at times i had to stand in the surgery and almost demand to be seen i was so concerned. I was sent home by the GP + within hours i had to call an ambulance. My son was then admitted to hospital and placed on a drip. On three separate occasions we ended up using an ambulance it got so bad.
Stow,Grateful for care,12/10/2015,4,I'm grateful for the care of my GP and other doctors there.
Stow,Great,10/10/2022,5,Ask My GP is good as you get call backs within a couple of hours. Telephone consultations work well and the system in place generally is very good. Staff are great too.
Stow,Great service. Quick response time,3/27/2021,4,"Everything is great but, I have just realised that I cannot order refills this way."
Stow,Great surgery,11/17/2016,4,Great - I wouldn't want to have to change surgeries !
Stow,Greeted with a smile,3/10/2018,5,The surgery has looked after me very well. For me the appointment system works and allows you to get appointments when you need them. You are greeted with a smile and staff are always pleasant and provide good explanations.
Stow,Happy to see any doctor,2/25/2019,5,I like that it is clear to see when you are being called for your appointment with a practitioner as they use the screens. The staff are friendly and because I normally need to visit for minor things I'm happy to see any of the doctors. The system in place does mean that you will get an appointment when you need it which is good.
Stow,Happy with surgery,8/14/2015,5,I'm quite happy with the surgery. I don't visit much but when I do I can always get an appointment
Stow,Have time for you,9/14/2018,5,"You can always speak to someone, they all have time for you and really do care.  If you really need to be seen you are seen quickly. Doctors really can't be faulted. Referrals are quickly processed. A bigger car park would help.
It's always been a good surgery but now it's even better. Call backs do happen really quickly - normally within 20 minutes.
Being able to do electronic prescriptions really helps.
Over Christmas we needed urgent antibiotics after seeing the district nurse, within hours they were available.
Having consistency with the doctors has been very good"
Stow,Health centre and other services work really,6/18/2016,5,a good system is in place but more feedback is needed directly from the doctors. It would be good to get a call with blood test result even if nothing is wrong. The combined health centre and other services work really well
Stow,Health concern dealt with superbly,2/19/2021,5,Excellent consultation received for a health condition which flagged up a possible health concern.  Issue was dealt with in an extremely sympathetic and professional manner.  Follow up phone call for reassurance was greatly appreciated.
Stow,helpful and reassuring,4/9/2015,5,Appointment was on time. Courteous staff.  My wife was invited to attend the examination which we found helpful and informative and our questions were answered satisfactorily.  No negative comments.
Stow,Helpful staff,10/10/2022,4,The surgery runs smoothly and the staff are very helpful. I find the Ask My GP system works really well especially when working as I can't take calls at work. The staff including the receptionists are great.
Stow,Helpful staff,12/16/2019,5,"Staff are very helpful here, I find that appointments are easy to get when you want one. A good all-round surgery."
Stow,I can only rate,11/19/2020,1,"Using ""AskmyGP"" is an awful experience. Starting with registering and setting a password, it hangs continually needs refreshing and the prompts and workflow are arbitrary and random in nature, the process workflow is very poor - do better."
Stow,I can't fault the surgery,8/10/2015,5,I can't fault the surgery. My doctor called me at 7pm to discuss my test results and this was great. You can always get an appointment when needed.
Stow,I don't like the triage system,6/9/2016,5,"Quite long delays - always about 1/2 hour late going in to appointment.  I don't like the triage system with them having to call you back.  It's not easy if you have to work and just need a general appointment.
Appointments with the GPs are good.  Having the larger health centre facilitis is great with all the additional services on site."
Stow,I felt very let down,4/19/2018,1,"I felt very let down by the surgery, no support provided and I was told I was too complex."
Stow,I find it easy to get appointments,9/1/2017,5,I find it easy to get to see my doctor and I like that they are helpful
Stow,I rarely see a GP!!,2/14/2019,2,"My only positive experience here is seeing one of the nurses... 

I find the surgery unpleasant & too big. I feel that having to share my info with a receptionist before they put me through to anyone else invasive!  

I don't like the fact that my name comes up on a big screen & all & sundry know who I am seeing!  

I also have 'White Coat Syndrome', so they rarely get a normal BP read out of me & that is not likely to change... I feel anxious every-time I go & am unable to get into a different surgery... 

Hate it, other than one particular nurse who just seems to get me, & I try to see her for everything..."
Stow,I really like the  triage system,10/8/2015,5,I really like the triage system as I get to speak to a doctor to see if I actually need to come in. Car park needs improving.
Stow,I'd prefer to see a doctor than the triage system,7/16/2015,4,I'd prefer to see a doctor than the triage system. For some conditions more regular medication reviews would be better.
Stow,Impressed by trainee GP,12/2/2016,5,I saw a trainee GP recently and was really impressed they were excellent. They even remembered my husband from the week before.
Stow,It's almost always a good experience.,6/4/2020,5,A visit to Stowhealth is almost always a good one - unless they are overwhelmed - and that is the fault of the government.
Stow,I've had a really good experience,10/8/2015,5,I've had a really good experience with my doctor she is amazing. I think the surgery has improved over the last year. I get to see my doctor all the time and they are great at calling you back.
Stow,I've had the same doctor for years,12/21/2015,5,I've had the same doctor for years and my doctor has been sorting out the problems I have with my leg.
Stow,I've never not been able to get an appointmen,10/8/2015,5,I've lived in the area for 12 years and I never have had a problem. I've never not been able to get an appointment on the same day
Stow,Kind staff,6/17/2022,4,I booked my appointment months ago but have turned up today and there's no record of the appointment but staff have arranged for me to be seen and sorted it all out which is great. Ask My GP works well for general appointments and staff are kind and happy. It generally works well as you get to see the most appropriate person for the problem.
Stow,Lack of empathy,7/27/2018,3,"Theres a lack of real care from the doctors, lack of empathy regarding mental health."
Stow,Lack of Patient Consideration,1/18/2021,3,"This practice lists 23 GPs most of whom are only available 2 days a week or less. I wonder if any of them or the management of the practice have noticed that the Vets practice at the bottom of the road (which they must pass) has erected a temporary shelter for pets and owners whilst waitng outside. For the last year sick patients waiting for prescriptions, appointments or blood tests have had to wait exposed to all weathers outside the front door. Is the lack of ""provider response"" (good and bad) in this site feedback indicative of the care offered ??"
Stow,LD  Good,7/13/2017,4,Went to have a health check.  It's normal.  I don't need to go back any more which is good. Doctor was a very pleasant man
Stow,Leg clinic very good.,7/16/2015,5,The leg clinic has been very good. The ulcers have been treated and the regular leg assessments are good for monitoring and everything.
Stow,"Like my doctor, reception desk is too high",12/8/2016,5,"When I need an appointment I can get one, my support worker helps me make the call. Sometimes it can be 1/2 hour to wait for my appointment. I like that my doctor talks about me and to me. I don't like the reception desk as it is too high for me."
Stow,Like talking to the doctor before appointment,5/9/2018,5,Very good surgery where you can get an appointment when required. I like that you can speak to the doctor before going in to the surgery.
Stow,Like the call backs,1/8/2018,5,"Bright clean and lots of space, enough room so you don't feel every one can hear everything. The TV screen could have larger print but its good and informative. I like the triage call backs as it works well for me and I don't have to come in all the time. I don't see my own doctor much but it doesn't make any difference other than you can feel they don't know you so well."
Stow,Like the triage and phone systems.,7/16/2015,5,"I like the triage systems and the telephone consultations as I'm busy and I find it easier, but on occasions it would nice to have an appointment."
Stow,Like the triage system,5/9/2018,5,"I really like my doctor, they really listen and have been very good. I like the triage system when you talk to the doctor first as it prevents unnecessary visits to the surgery."
Stow,Like the triage system,12/21/2017,5,"Really like the triage system in place, it works well for me but I could see that some people may have difficulty with it."
Stow,Like to book routine appts in advance,7/16/2015,5,It would be nice to book non emergency appointments ahead of time so that you can plan ahead.
Stow,Listened to and taken seriously,12/21/2015,5,"As a patient I feel that I am listened to and if I raise concerns they are taken seriously. I am amazed at the range of services available at Stowhealth, it makes it so much easier. If I see a diabetic nurse and she needs to check something she can easily go and speak to my doctor."
Stow,Mainly see own GP,2/26/2019,5,"I never have a problem getting an appointment, if it can be sorted by phone it is and this prevents going to the surgery when not necessary. Mainly see my own GP but if not I'm happy to see the other doctors.  Very good at explaining issues fully and I'm very happy overall."
Stow,"Maybe late, but do the job right....",7/8/2019,5,I had to wait to see the doctor past my time however i just wanted to say how nice it was to talk it through with a doctor that cared and gave the time and effort to try and help me..not rushing me becuase he was late! A credit to your surgery. I know there was more people. Thankyou to each of you...
Stow,Medication review with nurse,10/22/2022,1,I had a terrible experience. I was told the appointment was for a medication review but it was to take blood etc. I asked the nurse is this a medication review and she said 'yes'.  She then took blood which I was not expecting. I then asked her if I could have a certain product added to my repeats and she said I would have to see the doctor for that. I said I thought this was a medication review!
Stow,Meds often prescribed via phone consultation,12/16/2019,5,"Nurses are excellent, I wish we could be seen by the doctor rather than being prescribed medications via the phone consultation, I think the GP needs to see the patient sometimes."
Stow,Midwifery support excellent here,12/16/2019,5,"Midwifery excellent here, consistency and quality excellent. About the only thing that could be better here is the car park it is not adequate size for the need."
Stow,Mismanagment of long term meds,8/14/2015,2,"Resident of care home on long term Codeine. New monthly prescription gave an incorrect dosage, caused extreme distress to resident. Causing staff to have to repeatedly contact to rectify - when new drug arrived was again prescribed incorrectly causing further unnecessary work for staff and further distress to the resident. Resident self medicates so was extremely  concerned."
Stow,Mixed,9/10/2015,4,"For the care of our residents the service is unfaultable. For my own care, I feel often I am not taken seriously. I don't often visit the Dr so when I do I would appreciate some time!"
Stow,Mixed messages from professionals,12/2/2016,4,After having a medication review with the pharmacist he said I should see my doctor as he was concerned that the medication I was on was not working. When I called my doctor to discuss this he just said to continue without even seeing me.  I found this concerning.
Stow,"More houses being built, how will they cope?",12/16/2019,5,"I phoned up this morning and the doctor called me back and told me to come straight up, I am happy with swift service. Staff very good and helpful. Doctor can seem a bit rushed at times. I don't know how they are going to cope with more houses being built. I feel very strongly that another surgery should be built to cope with demand."
Stow,More time for appointments.,8/4/2016,3,Older people don't like telephone calls from GP Practice. Would like longer appointments as have a lot problems but have to make different appointment as no time on first visit.
Stow,My Doctor always calls back,7/19/2018,5,When I call for an appointment I am told my doctor will call me back and she always does! She then tells me if I need to go in or what I need to do-very good!!
Stow,My doctor is great,4/21/2016,5,My doctor is great I don't see her very often but when I do I have no problems.
Stow,my doctor is really good,10/8/2015,5,"My doctor is really good, I get to speak to him all the time and then visit when needed."
Stow,Never any problems.,8/24/2019,5,"Never had any problems here, they are very helpful. I am more than happy with this surgery, the children's play area is also helpful while we are waiting to go in."
Stow,Never had a bad experience,7/14/2015,5,For both my husband + myself I feel that having the same doctor for so long has been really beneficial to the care + treatment received. Even when we've seen other GPs we have never had a bad experience.
Stow,New doctor great,11/2/2019,5,"Great, I saw a new doctor recently and when things didn't improve with the medication I was given I went back. He then did blood tests straight away and I was called later in the day and told to go straight to hospital. I was very impressed with everything."
Stow,New patient,9/29/2022,4,"It's all been very efficient and my prescriptions have been set up well. I had a letter inviting me in for an appointment with a nurse, there was also the opportunity to rearrange the appointment if it wasn't convenient so been very pleased so far. As a new patient it would be helpful to be told or given information about how to book appointments when you join the practice as I wasn't sure how to use Ask My GP  or what I needed to do.  It all worked well but some advice when you register would be good."
Stow,Nice staff,7/27/2018,4,Very nice staff and a good local surgery that for me works well. The triage system works well too as it means you don't have to have an appointment if it can be sorted another way.
Stow,No improvement required.,8/4/2016,5,All staff (leg clinic) are professional and caring. No improvement required.
Stow,No negative experiences.,7/16/2015,5,I've had no negative experiences and haven't had any trouble getting appointments. The treatment I've received here is much better than my previous surgery.
Stow,No problems getting appointments,11/2/2019,5,"Don't have any issues getting appointments, I can't always  see my GP as they work part time but the other doctors are good and I don't mind seeing them."
Stow,No problems getting appointments,4/10/2016,5,I've never had a problem getting an appointment and they will always see the children if there is a problem or concern. It's great that there are so many other services all in the same building and that they have a range of skilled practitioners so that you do not need to see the GP all the time.
Stow,No response to messages,11/27/2020,2,Used my GP service to get a face to face appointment. They said the GP I requested was not on until Monday and would I like her to call then. I sent a message back to say any GP would be fine as wanted help today. No reply. I then sent a further  message to see if my request had been updated still no reply. Sent a 3rd to ask if anybody was going to call me today no reply.
Stow,No text message reminder,6/17/2022,4,"I'm happy with the doctors, they are very good. I've seen a trainee GP who sought a second opinion on two occasions, although it's worrying when it happens I'm glad they checked. My baby's injections have all been done on time and I've had no issues arranging the appointment.  I didn't get the text message reminder for this appointment for some reason."
Stow,Not a fan of Ask My GP,2/16/2023,4,"I don't like Ask My GP as I feel that it takes longer than calling the surgery. I've had to wait hours for a call back this morning,  and I don't like the uncertainty of knowing what will happen when.  It makes it much more difficult to let work know whether I'm coming in or not.  The staff though are nice and helpful on the phone and I'm happy to see whoever is available, other than one doctor.  I feel that booking appointments in  advance would be fine with Ask My GP but for on the day issues it would be much easier to call."
Stow,Not always taken seriously,7/10/2015,4,"For the care of our residents, the service is unfaultable. For my own care, I feel I am not taken seriously. I don't often visit the doctor, so when I do I would appreciate some time."
Stow,Not enough discussion re child's treatment,7/16/2015,4,Sometimes I feel that issues around my child's treatment are not discussed with me in enough detail.
Stow,Not focusing on the patient,12/10/2015,5,"Irritating amount of time on the telephone.
Continuous typing on their computer when the consultation is going on."
Stow,Not good this week,12/3/2019,3,"This week has not been good, I called initially and saw a visiting doctor from Ipswich. I was then advised to see the nurse which meant coming back the next day, when I arrived they told me after waiting that the appointment slot had been double booked and I would have to come back the next day. Its meant three days of disruption with work as they couldn't fit me in for something minor. This is very frustrating and unnecessary especially when we have so many other things happening with hospital visits."
Stow,Not helpful,3/12/2018,3,I am unable to book appointments until the morning of the day that the appointment is needed. That is not helpful if the patient is my parent in a care home and they need notice to prepare for the appointment.
Stow,Not rushed through,2/26/2019,4,"Seem to be given enough time to be seen and discuss issues aqequately and you're not rushed through. On the whole staff are good. I keep being sent a repeat letter and I've asked to be removed from the mailing list but it still is sent.  The call backs from doctors mean that it can be difficult to get issues sorted as it has taken three phone calls to get this latest issue dealt with as I was told an appointment wasn't needed.  When I was finally seen the issue was sorted straight away. It needs to be clearer that prescriptions take time to reach the pharmacy, people expect it to be ready to collect straight after their appointment."
Stow,Nurses are very good,7/27/2018,5,I don't feel it is necessary that the receptionist ask why I need an appointment. The nurses are very good and explain everything really well
Stow,Nursing staff are great,7/14/2015,5,The nursing staff at the surgery are great and I really can't fault them. They are very supportive.
Stow,On the day appointments good,3/10/2018,5,"Almost guaranteed to see a doctor when you call for an appointment, I've always got one on the day. The triage system works well for me especially as I visit infrequently."
Stow,Only 3 disabled bays available,2/16/2023,4,"The car park is always very busy and there are only three disabled parking bays which makes things very difficult.  Staff are very good, polite and listen to what you are saying and reception staff always handle appointment requests well. I haven't seen a GP in years but do see the nurses regularly, there's a few of them so never sure who it will be but they all treat issues well. Considering the situation they are doing well but in the past I haven't felt listened to so well but now its good but I would prefer better continuity."
Stow,Overall a very good practice.,7/16/2015,5,The car park is nowhere near big enough for the number of patients and it is very difficult for people with children or mobility issues. Having the pharmacy on site makes it much easier for patients and means you don't have to go into town for medication. Overall a very good practice.
Stow,Overall I am glad,8/24/2019,4,I would like to have the consistency of the same GP and unfortunately I don't often get that here. The car park is a bit small. But overall I am glad I'm with this surgery - I think this must be a training surgery as they sometimes seem a bit inexperienced?
Stow,Overall Positive experience,7/14/2015,5,Overall I've had a positive experience and have found the midwives really supportive.
Stow,"Overall, really good",7/16/2015,4,None
Stow,Parking,3/23/2016,1,Parking is always terrible at this surgery
Stow,Parking,3/23/2016,1,Parking is bad at this surgery.
Stow,Parking is a problem,10/8/2015,4,"Parking is a particular problem, but I understand its not easy to solve, The triage system works reasonably well."
Stow,Patients are filtered out to physicians associates,9/27/2020,3,"Never able to book a face to face appointment to see a Doctor. Even before Covid, always phone calls or filtered through to nurse or locum associates. 
Blood tests for different family members have noticed this practice does not wear gloves, use alcohol wipe and phlebotomists with bare hands after typing on keyboards palpate arm, then insert needle. Is this best practice?"
Stow,Perfect,11/10/2022,5,Ask My GP is really easy to use and the system prevents unnecessary trips in to the surgery. The staff are very friendly when talking to them or sorting any issues out.
Stow,Perfect surgery,11/10/2022,5,"Its a perfect surgery. Staff are always polite and appointments run to time. When I've raised concerns with the doctor I've been taken seriously which is great, the doctors are great."
Stow,perfectly good staff,11/10/2022,5,Its perfect. The system in place allows appointments to be had easily and I find that Ask My GP works very well as its simple to use and gets good results. I spoke to a GP this morning and have now been invited in for an appointment. The staff are perfectly good.
Stow,Pharmacy very good,7/23/2015,4,"The Boots pharmacy at the surgery is very good, they explain in detail to ensure that you know what the new medication is."
Stow,Phone calls work but..,12/5/2022,4,I do find that the phone calls with a GP work but I do feel that sometimes by not seeing a doctor they miss the bigger picture. Although it's ok to get the appointments I wouldn't be confident what would happen if I felt I needed to be seen.
Stow,"phone steer, parking poor, generally V good",3/15/2018,5,"They try to steer you to phone appointments, which is fine for many things and will see you if you insist or if they feel it appropriate.  No problem getting appoints. and generally seen on time.  Very Good practice, but parking can be a nightmare."
Stow,Phone triage works well,7/27/2018,5,"Everything works well, doctors are good and the phone call from the doctor works well and saves a visit to the surgery."
Stow,Pleasant people,3/30/2017,5,They were pleasant people.  I would've preferred to go to my own surgery but this option meant I saw a GP when I needed.
Stow,Polite staff,9/10/2018,4,"Ask My GP works really well to get appointments, really effective as you get to see the most suitable person. The staff are polite and helpful and it all seems to run very smoothly and its easy to access appointments when I need them."
Stow,Poor,8/24/2017,1,Been terrible.  Misdiagnosis meant delayed treatment and care.
Stow,Poor advice.,7/16/2015,3,"My son needs to see the physio so we saw the doctor who said we could self refer but when I tried I was told because he was under 16 that the doctor would need to refer him. This has delayed things further and another appointment is needed. Generally, the doctors are quite good. Due to a specific condition I felt that is important to have continuity of care and we do see the same doctor most of the time."
Stow,Poor communication,8/23/2018,2,"One of our residents had DVT and had prescribed Rivaroxaban tablets and was already taking Aspirin. Aspirin was stopped by GP in 6 but we were only informed on 31/7/18 and only because we called dispensary to ask why we did not receive new stock of Aspirin. We have administered Aspirin to the resident all this time as we have not been informed that it was discontinued by GP in 6, at hospital request."
Stow,Poor for car parking,3/23/2016,2,Parking is a problem here.
Stow,Poor response time,2/8/2018,1,"Requested GP visit in the morning for a resident with Urinary tract infection (UTI) not responding, very high pulse, generally deteriorating in condition. Called again around lunch time and surgery was closed for training. As resident was getting worse, contacted 999 to attend."
Stow,Poor service,8/2/2021,2,"3 minutes to at least get through to phone options let alone someone pick up the phone. Called up about something very urgent. Waited over 4 hours for a call back. 
Only a couple of good GPS. You're lucky if you get given more than ibuprofen. And that's if you actually see a gp. It's rare that anyone will actually see you. And that was before covid. Then even when advised meds by the hospital consultant. They won't prescribe them because they don't agree!

Its got to the point I don't want to go there for anything now. I'd rather call 111 and that's not how it should be at all"
Stow,Poor. GP didn't wait for answers and was dismissive,10/4/2017,1,"My appointment was on time.  The GP kept asking me questions and not allowing me to answer the questions.  My support worker tried to answer on my behalf due to GP not allowing me to, but the GP continued to override explanations.  I felt I wasn't being heard and easily dismissed and felt the same for my support worker.  GP needs to listen to what is being told, allow more time for patient to answer and not to dismiss concerns.  More training required with supporting individuals with learning difficulties"
Stow,Poor. Receptionist gave wrong information on a test result,7/9/2017,1,"Underactive thyroid: calling for blood test result.  Reception insisted on giving me the results and told me ""results were in the normal region and no further action would be taken"". I requested to speak to a doctor and she was annoyed and said it wasn't necessary.  Eventually the doctor phoned me back and as a result of the tests increased my medication. So obviously not normal!  What would have happened if I had not asked to speak to the doctor? As far as I'm aware reception staff are not doctors!  As such they should not be giving medical advice or advising on the results.  This is massively unprofessional, not to mention dangerous.  This must be addressed"
Stow,Prefer face to face appointments,2/16/2023,4,I do find it hard to get in to the surgery and would prefer a face to face appointment rather than doing most things on the phone as I find this more difficult. There isn't really an option other than using Ask My GP which tends to lead to a telephone call and when I've raised how difficult I find them it's just been ignored.  When I called recently it did sound like the phone was put down on me but it could've been a glitch with the phone system.
Stow,Prefer not to use Ask My GP,6/17/2022,4,I prefer not to use Ask My GP as I feel that older people are being forgotten when access to services is being thought about. I do call but feel you have to answer a lot of questions before you get to have an appointment.
Stow,Prefer personal contact with GP,7/16/2015,4,Would prefer to see a GP rather than a telephone call. Having said that usually gets an appointment on the day.
Stow,Prefer to see the same doctor more often,2/24/2016,3,I'd prefer to see the same doctor more often. When they have been busy I've had to wait over 1/2 hour to be seen. I've had a blood test recently and been told the results will be back in a month and they will call me.
Stow,preferred old appointment card system,6/27/2017,4,I go to the clinic to have my feet done.  They used to give you an appointment card on which they wrote your next appointment before you left which worked really well as you could say if you couldn't make the date suggested.  Now they send a letter with your appointment and you have to call to rearrange if it doesn't suit you.  It was much better the way it was.  Overall the care provided is good
Stow,Problem with medications.,7/16/2015,4,Dissatisfaction that this practice wouldn't dispense previous medication causing problem. Criticised for taking advice from pharmacists.
Stow,Problems with appointments.,7/16/2015,4,Getting an appointment for myself can be trickier than for my child. I have had to wait up to three weeks for an appointment with the nurse.
Stow,Problems with getting appointments.,7/16/2015,5,"I called 8 times this morning and kept getting a message saying they were busy, to call back later. I started at 0810 and I got through by about 0930. I understand they are busy but it is frustrating and I need to be able to do other things as well."
Stow,Quick and easy blood tests,6/7/2016,5,Blood tests are quick and easy to book and Nurses are excellent. I was given an appointment to discuss the results when they came in.
Stow,Quick appointment,12/3/2019,5,Don't visit very often but when I do the car park is very busy. I called first thing this morning and got through very quickly which surprised me. I spoke to the doctor who arranged an appointment for later in the morning. The system in place worked well.
Stow,Quick appointments,9/8/2018,5,"Rang for a blood test appointment this morning ad got one straight away. The same happens with the doctors appointments, you can see any of the doctors and they all know you well and provide good explanations. Car parking is very difficult and I worry there will be no parking when I arrive."
Stow,Quick call back,3/10/2018,5,"Can alway get appointments when you need them, the triage sysem works well, its a very good system where call backs are quick and even if you don't see your own doctor you see another GP but this is ok its just that your doctor has a better overview.  The call back this morning happened with in an hour and I was given an appointment, not with my own GP but the doctor I spoke to knew all my details. Prescriptions are also always ready on time which makes things easier."
Stow,Quite flexible with appointments,2/26/2019,4,Easy and quick to book appointments and I like to talk to the doctor before coming in. When you are offered an appointment  they are quite flexible with what you are offered.  The doctors and nurses normally provide all the information I need which is good.
Stow,quite helpful,7/27/2018,4,Everyone is quite helpful. The two hour call back time could be reduced as it feels a long time when waiting especially when its about the children.
Stow,Really good,2/15/2023,5,"Really efficient using Ask My GP, it works really well. The staff are nice and they look after me well.  I'm also seeing the physio and they've arranged for that appointment and another to take place one after the other.  I've had no problems getting the children seen quickly and feel that staff listen to what you're saying too."
Stow,Really like the triage system,1/8/2018,5,"Excellent service, I really like the triage system and virtually always get an appointment when needed. Really can't fault the service."
Stow,Really liked seeing my own doctor,2/25/2019,5,"I can get appointments straight away, its beneficial that by having the call backs it means that you don't have to visit the surgery all the time and things can be sorted over the phone. I'm happy to see any of the doctors but recently I've been seeing my own GP which has been really good to have the continuity.  They've changed my medication recently and this has worked well, with everythig explained well. My medications are delivered and arrive on time."
Stow,Really quick,2/16/2023,5,"I find Ask My GP efficient and really quick to get a response, it was 5 mins today.  After speaking to the GP I've now been invited in for an appointment. I don't use the surgery much but the last few times I have used Ask My GP I've found it easy to use and has resulted in the issues I've had being addressed appropriately."
Stow,Reception are very good and helpful,8/30/2018,5,"Called early this morning, spoke to a doctor and was given an appointment. Reception are very good and helpful. If you don't need to come in, you can just talk to someone on the phone."
Stow,reception staff are 'top of the form'!,12/16/2019,4,"The reception staff are 'top of the form', very good."
Stow,Receptionist polite and friendly,3/10/2018,5,The surgery staff are pretty understanding and quite quick too. Receptionists are always polite and friendly. The doctors call you back quickly during the morning and you generally get to see your own doctor which is good as they know you better. The doctors listen to what you are haying and take everything on board. The car park is a worry and needs sorting out as you can never be sure you will find somewhere to park.
Stow,Receptionists always helpful and courteous.,1/10/2018,5,Once in the system little time is wasted. The doctor is informed of your call and is prepared . He sees you later the same day if necessary but always speaks to you. Very efficient and reassuring.
Stow,Receptionists are a bit bolshie,6/30/2015,5,The receptionists do tend to be a bit bolshie and one even told results of test but got it wrong. It would be easier to have test done when you are already at the surgery rather than having to come back at a later point. The extra taxi costs don't help.
Stow,Referral took a long time,3/10/2018,3,The last few times I've visited the appointments have run behind. With chronic issues I don't feel that staff have looked for other possible solutions and just give different medications to try to solve the problem. Once I was referred to hospital things have been sorted quickly but its just a shame it was so slow to get the referral.
Stow,Running out of Spirigel,3/23/2016,2,They are always running out of Spirigel.  Touchscreen on sign is often dirty and possibly infected by germs of ill people.
Stow,See one main doctor,3/10/2018,5,"I've never had a problem with my medication and I have a lot, I can pick up all my medication and its ready on time and accurate. I have a main doctor I see but will happily see the duty doctor as the care has always been good. I can always get an appointment when ever I need one so it all works well for me."
Stow,See the same GP usually,7/23/2015,5,I do get to see the same doctor most of the time which is good.
Stow,Seeing same doctor a problem,7/23/2015,3,Getting to see a doctor is a little difficult but I regularly talk to my doctor and I'm happy with this. Being able to talk to my doctor each time ensures greater continuity.
Stow,Seems easier to get appointments now,6/17/2022,5,"The service is very good, efficient and with complex care needs they always try their best. The staff are friendly and yet professional and I have a good rapport with them. Appointments are quick and easy to access and it does seem easier now to get them. I do worry that the triage process could be a barrier for some patients as they do not like or find being on the phone difficult."
Stow,Seen straight away,11/10/2022,5,"It's quick to get through on the phone and I've been seen straight away. There are no negatives with the surgery, everything is really good including the staff."
Stow,Short waiting times,8/17/2016,4,It's great that you don't have to wait too long for appointments. It's a good surgery but I don't go often
Stow,Smooth efficient service,12/16/2019,5,They cope very well in light of more homes being built. It is a very smooth and efficient service and they have always treated me well. I am impressed with the surgery. It is warm and has plenty of reading material available. Car park is too small for the need.
Stow,Staff always there for you,1/8/2018,5,"Brilliant. Staff are always there for you and are very good, Blood test appointment s are easy to get the system runs well. A coffee machine would be nice to have."
Stow,Staff are brilliant.,7/16/2015,5,The staff here are absolutely brilliant.
Stow,Staff are good,2/15/2023,5,I'm happy with the surgery. I've been invited in for my annual check and I've been able to see the same doctor recently which has been beneficial. Staff are good and they explain issues well so I'm happy with how it is all working.
Stow,Staff at all levels are always helpful.,11/10/2020,5,My family and I have been registered with Stowhealth since 1982 and have watched it grow. We have always experienced extremely good care and help in all this time. We feel that the care and the experience and help that we have been given by the doctors and nursing care staff has been second to none. We feel very fortunate to be registered with such a good team. Thank you to all.
Stow,Staff don't push online access,6/17/2022,5,I call when I need an appointment and the staff do not push using Ask My GP. I was called back within 2.5 hours by the clinician who then arranged for me to be seen. The staff are brilliant and lovely with you and I'm very satisfied with how the surgery works as it's quick and easy to get appointments and I'm happy to see any of the doctors.
Stow,Staff good,2/25/2019,5,"The appointment system does mean that you can't plan ahead, which is more difficult if you are working. You also have to wait for a doctor to call you back which isn't always easy. I've never not been able to get an appointment though when I've wanted one. The staff, doctors and nurses are all very good at what they do."
Stow,"Staff good, system works well.",7/16/2015,5,I think the staff are all quite good. The system works quite well but I would prefer to see the same doctor more often.
Stow,Staff great,9/13/2022,4,"Every person I've seen has been great, very good and so much better than my last surgery. Ask My GP is really great and is so easy to use. Following an appointment I wanted to book a follow up appointment but when I tried talking to reception I was told that I have to call or use Ask My GP again, seems a bit silly when you're in the building. Staff are very good and I do feel you see the most relevant person too."
Stow,Staff know what they are doing,12/12/2019,5,"Always seem efficient, staff know what they are doing. High quality medical staff. I do like the GP ring back service after I make the phone call to the surgery. More parking please."
Stow,Staff treat you with dignity and respect,10/8/2015,5,The friendliness of staff and all treat you with dignity and respect
Stow,Staff were very good,12/14/2017,4,They do give you exercises but when they didn't work and I finished I felt a little left hanging and not sure what to do next. The pain is still there. The staff were very good.
Stow,"Superb environment, parking and service",10/11/2015,5,I had an Echocardiogram examination which was done as soon as I arrived - no fuss - no bother.  Excellent
Stow,Support provided is very good,2/22/2018,5,The support provided by the surgery has been very good. They call me back and make sure I have all my medication on time.
Stow,Surgery has been ok,12/10/2015,5,Don't use surgery much but when I do it has been ok
Stow,Surgery works fine.,7/16/2015,5,The way the surgery works at the moment is fine with me.
Stow,System doesn't work,3/10/2018,3,The one issue with the surgery is the appointment system. If you work it is not always possible to take the call back from the doctor so it makes it very difficult to get an appointment.
Stow,System works well,12/3/2019,5,"Very good. You can ring and speak to a doctor and they will give you an appointment if one is needed, which works well. Staff are generally very good, friendly and helpful. I don't generally see my own GP but happy to see anyone available."
Stow,System works well.,7/16/2015,4,The current system works very well and I have always managed to get an appointment when I need one.
Stow,Telephone consultations work well,2/16/2023,5,Most of my appointments are for blood tests and these have been no problem to arrange. Telephone consultations have been very good and work well to address issues. Staff are always lovely and pleasant and I don't feel they could be doing anything better.  I really like that prescriptions are delivered it makes it much easier for me.
Stow,terrible experience of trying to log on,10/2/2021,1,could not log on with existing user name and i could not obtain a password reset  this was extremely poor compared with other systems i have used not impressed with the soft wear used
Stow,The doctor was a nice man,7/5/2018,4,"Mum and Dad went to the surgery. We signed in and waited for a few minutes. It was quite busy, then we went in. The doctor was foreign. What a nice man he was."
Stow,The new ask my GP service is hard work,12/14/2020,2,"Ask my GP services is difficult kept putting back to the start when I tried to do a photo so had to type it all again for the same thing to happen. Cant get a face to face appointment, it all feels cold and detached."
Stow,The nurses are brilliant,10/8/2015,5,The nurses are brilliant. They are really fantastic. The only thing with the triage system is that I would prefer to actually see my doctor as I find being on the phone more difficult to explain things.
Stow,The reception desk is too high,4/8/2017,5,I have help to book my appointments and the waits in the surgery can be long. My doctors listens to me but I do find the reception desk is too high and would like it lower.
Stow,The staff are great,12/10/2015,5,I am happy with the way the nurses visit me at home. If needed they will get the doctor to visit me too. The staff are great and this includes the twilight nurses who visit.
Stow,The surgery and the triage system works well,8/30/2018,5,The triage system allows you to access an appointment very quickly. It allows you to have a phone consultation and not have to come in if it isn't necessary. Overall the surgery works well. Getting prescription works well too.
Stow,The surgery has been great,10/8/2015,5,I sometimes do not think of all the questions to ask at the time but I would be happy to call back. The surgery has been great.
Stow,The triage system is rational,7/10/2015,5,The plug in the toilets was missing. The triage system used is very rational and prevents having to attend the surgery all the time. I've been referred to the physio by the surgery rather than seeing the doctor first and this has worked well.
Stow,Things can get missed,7/10/2015,4,The triage system being used means you don't always get to see a doctor. I feel that by not being seen face to face it's not so good and things can get missed.
Stow,This must be one of the best practices in the,6/1/2021,5,I have been extremely well cared for
Stow,Thorough,9/8/2018,5,Its a thorough service. You can get appointments when you need them and the support provided is good. The triage system also works well but then I would only phone when I need an appointment.
Stow,Toenail has re-grown,10/20/2016,2,"Podiatrist.
I had my toenail removed but the toenail has re-grown.  I've tried to contact them but there's only an answerphone. The staff were good but I've now gone private and have been told the wrong technique was used and resulted in the re-growth.  I now don't have faith that the NHS service will be able to treat me and I will need to go private."
Stow,"too long to get appointment, rushed appts.",8/14/2015,3,"Some staff can be quite abrupt.  To see a doctor, not necessarily my own, I have to wait up to 3 weeks for an appointment.  I have been told my doctor only works part-time but this is to see any doctor.  Sometimes doctors can be a little abrupt when explaining treatment.  They are rushed but it ca feel like they are trying to get you out for the next person to come in"
Stow,Top class,2/25/2019,5,"Everything they do is very good. They have always had time for me and I've never felt rushed. I have regular INRs which are easy to book and I like that the drs will call you back and that you can discuss the issue without coming to the surgery, it all works very well, top class."
Stow,Treatment not fully explained,7/14/2015,3,I dont feel that I've ever had treatment fully explained which is due to rushing you in + out.
Stow,Triage system,7/14/2015,4,The only small issue I have is the triage system. It can be a bit frustrating waiting for the GP to call back.
Stow,Triage System,4/14/2015,5,"Phoned yesterday, spoke to a receptionist who said my doctor wasn't in, and that he could phone back tomorrow (today) or I could speak to a different doctor. I choose to speak to my doctor who phoned me today, he asked me in depth questions and then told me to book a repeat blood test, he also prescribed me some medication to trial for a month and explained why he was prescribing me the medication and asked me if it was alright to do so."
Stow,Triage system does not work,6/15/2017,3,Triage system at Stowhealth does not work.  I was very unwell and tried to get an appointment three times only to be told I had gastroenteritis and didn't need to be seen.  I finally got an appointment and an ambulance was called for me
Stow,Triage works,3/10/2018,5,"Never had any problems at the surgery. Its a bright airy building which is clean and well equipped. The triage system works well, you get a cal back with in a couple of hours and the staff are friendly and considerate."
Stow,Triage works ok,9/8/2018,5,"Nice and organised surgery, very helpful staff and it has everything you need. The triage system works ok and getting the call back from the doctor is good too."
Stow,Triage works well,12/3/2019,4,"The triage system works well, you get to see the same GP now although it can take a bit longer. Nurses have been nice and friendly and have explained things well. The car park is a bit of an issue. I do feel that there needs to be more care and support  around reproductive health, at times I've felt dismissed and not listened to by male doctors I've seen."
Stow,Triage works well,2/25/2019,5,Always very good with staff being helpful and accomodating . I caled yesterday and was given an appointment in the morning for a blood test which was really great. Staff are friendly and nothing really needs to change. The triage system works well and prevents the need to come to the surgery unnecessarily. Parking is a problem at the site but limited in what can be done. The doctors give good explanations and they treat you like an individual so you feel listened to.
Stow,Triage works well,9/13/2022,5,The Doctors I see give me the information I need and I can get to see or speak to a Doctor on the day.  The triage system works well.
Stow,Understanding,2/16/2023,5,I mainly use Ask My GP but there are times when I would prefer to just talk to them. Generally a good service where long term conditions are monitored well. Staff are understanding and do a good job considering the pressure.  They've always been there when I've needed them.
Stow,Understanding doctor,11/10/2022,5,I was called by the surgery yesterday and was told I needed to be seen and they arranged for an appointment today which was very quick.  I really like the message system on Ask My GP it works very well and makes communicating about ongoing issues a lot easier. The staff are good and I find my doctor very understanding.
Stow,Unsympathetic GP,12/28/2017,1,I spoke to my gp to tell her I was at breaking point because I have been looking after my terminally ill husband who is bedridden.  The response I got was totally unuseful and very upsetting; do not use diazepam and ring Suffolk wellbeing or do assessment online.  I cried for at least 30 minutes after that phone call.  Go said she had to end conversation because someone was waiting.
Stow,Very efficient flu vaccination clinic today.,6/12/2020,5,"I came to the 50-65’s flu vaccination clinic today. Extremely efficient and well organised. Good organisation making it feel very safe and covid secure. Despite a queue on arrival, I was done and leaving the car park within 10 minutes of arrival. Well done team!"
Stow,Very efficient service.,10/23/2020,5,"Helpful staff at all levels, good continuity of care even if own GP not available. No problems with getting to speak to a GP when you need to on the day."
Stow,Very good,11/10/2022,5,Ask My GP works very well as do online prescriptions. Appointments for blood tests are easy to get as generally they are available with in a few days.  I don't come to the surgery often and I'm not worried which of the doctors I see as I have no on going issues. It all works perfectly well.
Stow,Very good,9/13/2022,5,You can get on the day appointments easily enough but I prefer to call than go online. The triage process works well and I tend to be able to see the same GP for most appointments which I prefer. The doctors here are very good and explain things well.
Stow,Very good service,8/17/2016,4,I rang to speak to a doctor. I was called back within an hour and saw a doctor later that afternoon. Very good service as it operates like this all the time.
Stow,Very good service but parking is difficult,2/22/2018,3,"Parking is very difficult. Doctors and nurses are very good but stressed. There has been a bit of duplication with multiple visits. I have felt a bit passed around between staff, which can be a little disconcerting at times. It's a good facility with lots of services in one place. At times it would be nice to have a little more explanation from practitioners."
Stow,Very good services,7/16/2015,5,Today when I called for an appointment I was called back by the GP within 20 minutes. This can be longer at times but always within 2 hours. I'm happy to see any doctor and understand this is necessary as they are so busy.
Stow,"Very good, no problem getting appointments",12/14/2017,5,"They have been very good, no problems getting an appointment. The triage system works well and they do say when roughly they will call."
Stow,"Very good, works well.",4/18/2017,5,Normally very good when I come with the children.  The surgery works for us.  Rarely visit and when I do it works well.
Stow,Very good.,1/9/2017,5,This practice is very good. My GP takes my worries seriously and referred me straight away. Another doctor came out to get me when I was waiting. Very friendly and efficient.
Stow,Very good.,7/16/2015,5,"very good care taken, no problem with getting appointments"
Stow,Very good.,7/16/2015,5,Very good. I'm healthy.
Stow,Very happy,9/20/2021,5,"I find the surgery really good, I spoke to someone on the phone and they've given me an appointment but I'm not sure who it is with. Generally though appointments are with the appropriate member of staff.  I'm very happy."
Stow,Very happy with GP &  Out of hours service,6/15/2017,5,"Called 111 and spoke to an out of hours doctor at Stowhealth.  I didn't wait long for my appointment.  Very happy with the GP I saw;  they explained everything well.
Could you consider having staff at Eye more often as this would have been closer"
Stow,Very happy with the care I receive,11/11/2015,5,I'm very happy with the care I receive from my doctor but on occasions when I've ordered my prescription it hasn't been ready when I've gone to pick it up.
Stow,Very happy with the care received,8/4/2016,5,I've been very happy with the care received. The doctors and nurses now visit me at the care home and if there are any additional questions staff here will ask.
Stow,Very happy.,7/16/2015,5,I've been with the practice for 4 years and it is much better than where I was previously. It's good that so many other clinics are based here although I haven't used them yet.
Stow,Very helpful,12/10/2015,4,Very helpful
Stow,Very high quality doctors,12/16/2019,5,"Service here is excellent, doctors are of very high quality. Appointment making is easy and works well. Parking can be difficult."
Stow,Very kind doctors,11/11/2015,5,The doctors give me time and are very kind
Stow,Very professional,12/3/2019,5,"Its a very professional set up, easy to access the services needed by calling and speaking to a GP. Its quick to get appointments and staff are friendly and professional. Nothing really needs to change or improve."
Stow,Very quick response to my request,9/20/2021,5,"Cannot fault the practice, speedy, polite and clinically astute"
Stow,Very responsive,11/10/2022,5,"Ask My GP really does work very well and they are responded to quickly, I like being able to send a message back so that you can ask follow-up questions or get further clarification. It means you don't have to come into the surgery for everything too.  The doctors are very responsive and staff overall are good, I've never had any issues at the practice."
Stow,Very satisfied,8/14/2015,5,I'm a new patient but I do like the triage system whereby you talk to your doctor prior to getting an appointment
Stow,very supportive,6/24/2022,5,"Being able to see someone the same day is great. They are very supportive, listen and spend time with you. Generally very good and having the outreach services at the services at the surgery is great."
Stow,very supportive doctor,12/2/2016,5,My doctor has been very supportive and can't do enough for me.
Stow,Very understanding will listen,8/20/2015,5,Good waiting room and helpful staff on reception but the bad bit is trying to find car parking spaces. Puts every bodies blood pressure up.
Stow,Well organised flu clinic,3/10/2020,5,"Really well organised for the flu clinic today. Welcoming staff, clear direction and a 1 way system in place. Well done again Stow Health. I continue to be impressed by your service."
Stow,Went to A&E,8/24/2019,2,"Had celulitus, kept having phone consultations but I got very worried and went to A&E. I find it difficult to get a face to face with a GP, and I really think the appointments system needs to be improved, as I shouldn't need to go to A&E about these concerns."
Stow,Wish they'd use more official terms.,8/24/2019,5,"It would be nice if they could explain more in professional medical terms rather than in layman's terms about my condition, as I feel I already know a lot myself. Also I wish they would use more official terms like 'stomach' instead of 'tummy'."
Stow,Working well,9/23/2021,4,I've managed to get appointments fine and the screening programme's  are running as normal as far as I can see which is great.
Stow,Works quite well,2/26/2019,4,"No real problems at the surgery, you can get appointments quickly as and when needed and I'm happy to see any of the doctors. The waiting room can get quite warm but otherwise everything works quite well."
Stow,Works well,5/13/2019,5,It's a good surgery and the system works well for me and talking to the doctor about the issue or need for an appointment does prevent having an unnecessary appointment. Staff are good and I'm happy to see any of the doctors.
Stow,Works well,12/3/2019,4,"Other than waiting for the GP to call you back its not too bad. Staff are good an help when you phone up about things. Generally the system works quite well and when you need to talk to a doctor you can. I feel I am well listened to and can fully discuss whats going to happen next. To get todays appointment was easy enough, I needed to come to the surgery today as I have help to get here, it was arranged with reception and they even offered a choice of times as well."
Stow,Works well for me,6/17/2022,5,The surgery called me to have a follow up blood test after my annual review. I called on Friday and have been given an appointment with the health care assistant for bloods to be taken today (Monday). It all works well for me.
Stow,Wouldn't want to lose it,9/8/2018,5,"Efficient, always there when you need them and I wouldn't want to lose it. On the phone the number to select for emergency treatment is the last on the list but it would be better if this was first."
Stow,You can always get an appointment,12/12/2019,5,"You can always get an appointment. The staff are always polite. I am very grateful for the service you get here, and I am grateful to live here so that I can use it.. Could not be any better."
Stow,You don't have to wait too long,1/9/2016,4,It's great that you don't have to wait too long for appointments.  It's a good surgery but I don't go often
Stradbroke,1 week wait for non urgent issue,6/6/2022,4,"I've had a 1 week wait for a non urgent issue but if you need to be seen on the day there's no problem getting seen. I visit the surgery most for clinics and blood tests and have no issues getting the appointments.  The asthma clinic is excellent, I've learnt a lot about my condition from the very good nurse.  Getting the children in is also no problem, they're see the same day."
Stradbroke,5 star,9/16/2015,5,5 star
Stradbroke,5 star,9/16/2015,5,5 star
Stradbroke,A bit of a delay,6/6/2022,4,After visiting an optician they advised I needed to see my GP and have a blood test but it took two weeks for the surgery to act on the letter they sent. I've also had a small problem getting medication that a consultant recommended. I like to see the same GP if possible as I prefer the continuity and some staff aren't as helpful as others and it can feel a little rushed at times.
Stradbroke,A good surgery,2/28/2023,4,I've had mixed experiences but overall the surgery is good. On one occasion recently I was seen very quickly. On the other when I was running out of medication and was concerned I may need more antibiotics I was directed to the pharmacist in two days time rather than talking to a clinician. When I spoke to them my antibiotics had run out and they weren't able to do anything as I needed to be seen by a doctor so it wasted their time and mine.  Medical staff have been good but sometimes it feels you're not being directed appropriately.
Stradbroke,A good surgery,6/6/2022,5,"I booked my appointment a week ago for an advanced appointment on a specific day, the surgery are very accommodating in that respect. I like that doctors appointments are available to book online as it means you can pick when and who suits you best.  The staff are helpful and explain things well. It would be helpful if you could book blood test appointments online as well."
Stradbroke,A good surgery all round,9/22/2016,5,A good surgery all round. I get to see my own GP generally which I do like and I'm happy with the treatment and care.
Stradbroke,A very good practice,6/6/2022,5,"It's been very good this morning for an emergency appointment and a follow up blood test. There are lovely people at the practice always polite, nice and helpful. I do have a bit of a concern regarding the capacity of the practice with the building happening locally."
Stradbroke,Able to ask questions,2/28/2019,4,"Waiting times at the surgery aren't too bad, people need to be seen and some may need longer than others so its understandable. When you're with the doctor you feel able to ask questions relating to the treatment. Even if they are running late you're never made to feel you have to get out the door quickly.  This and Fressingfield are the best surgeries in the county. All the doctors are really good and underpaid."
Stradbroke,Able to give me an appointment today,8/24/2019,4,They were able to give me an appointment today as Fressingfield was full.
Stradbroke,Absoloutley wonderful & caring,6/15/2017,5,The surgery is absolutely wonderful.  They listen and it's great to be able to pick up medication.  The surgery will always phone you with anything that needs to be done.  A really caring surgery
Stradbroke,Absolutely excellent.,8/24/2019,5,Coffee machine would be good. Like Radio 2 here in waiting room. Absolutely excellent.
Stradbroke,Accessible service thats very good,6/15/2017,5,Stunning service.  Very accessible either here or in Fressingfield.  Can see doctors when needed
Stradbroke,All staff are great!,8/24/2019,5,Reception volume - not enough privacy. All staff are great! Never feel rushed.
Stradbroke,Appointment first thing,6/6/2022,5,"I called 111 overnight and they booked me an appointment for first thing this morning. I was also told I could call 111 back if I needed to or if anything got worse. The system worked really well, very pleased.  On a general basis I have frequent blood tests and never have any issues getting the appointments for them whenever they are needed."
Stradbroke,Appointments easy to get,6/6/2022,4,I find the phone tends to work better for accessing the surgery and the appointments I've had have been easy to get. I'm happy to see any of the doctors but I do try to see my own doctor where possible as they know me better.  To see a specific GP can takes a little more time so depending on the situation and whether I need an on the day appointment I am happy to see any doctor and attend either practice site.  The time allowed for appointments is tight so appointments do tend to run over but that is such a small thing when they are providing such a caring service.
Stradbroke,Appointments when needed,1/3/2019,5,The surgery runs smoothly and you can get appointments when needed. You can get through on the phone fairly easily and you will see someone with in a few days. I did have one issue  when I was trying to order a pre payment prescription card.
Stradbroke,Better communication needed about the service,5/18/2015,4,"I was recently in pain and waited to see my GP.   There are times when I have to wait 7 - 10 days for an appointment.  When I spoke to my GP about getting an appointment he told me I can call at 8 am to get an ""on the day"" appointment, which I didn't even realise you could do.  It would help if the surgery let patients know what is available and how it works."
Stradbroke,Booked in advance,6/6/2022,5,I booked todays appointment in advance with reception who are really helpful. I try to see the same GP and this works well for me.
Stradbroke,Brilliant,2/27/2023,5,Doctors and nurses are outstanding and overall it is a brilliant surgery where getting an appointment is never an issue. Reception can be very rude so I prefer not to call to talk to them. The treatment I’ve had from them at times has been shocking and I feel that some training is needed.
Stradbroke,Brilliant service,1/3/2019,5,"Its a very good surgery, they care and monitor things well, a brilliant service. The doctors listen and take you seriously and are excellent at referring when needed. It would be good if a poster advising patients to have an aneurysm check, there is one in Fressingfield surgery but not here."
Stradbroke,Brilliant surgery,6/6/2022,5,"I have no issues getting appointments and I'm happy to see the GP of my choice, they look after me well. They explain and advise well and have been so supportive. Our GP called late one evening to double check I had the right information to tell the hospital the next day, which was wonderful.  Notes are always up to date which helps when you aren't able to see your own doctor."
Stradbroke,Brilliant.,8/24/2019,5,"I can get an appointment. The GPs give time, and have consistency of the same GP. They are brilliant.The nurses are fantastic, and always do their best."
Stradbroke,Can get appointments easily,1/22/2020,5,I can get appointments easily. Location good. Good staff attitude.
Stradbroke,Cannot fault this surgery.,8/24/2019,5,"I cannot fault this surgery, I can get an appointment when I need to. I tend to book online which is easier. I think the posters are a little untidy. I wish we could have another GP."
Stradbroke,Cant fault them,6/15/2017,4,Really good doctors and nurses.  Can't fault them at all.  All very caring
Stradbroke,Delayed referral,11/10/2022,3,I wasn't overly happy that a nurse did not refer me straight away but when I called after the appointment to say I thought it was needed it was done very quickly.  Having the new computer system installed seems to be reducing the number of available appointments as it is more difficult at the moment. The phone message is very long and not sure it really needs to go on so much now.
Stradbroke,Difficult to get an appointment,9/22/2016,4,Getting an appointment can be a little difficult. The longest I've waited is a week for a non urgent appointment. I also do not like being made to feel I should tell the receptionist what is wrong with me.
Stradbroke,Do their best,1/3/2019,5,"They are doing their best but it does take a long time to sort problems out.  The automatic doors at Fressingfield are too quick to close it would be great if this time could be extended. Appointments can run behind but its reasonable considering they need to listen to everyone. I have problems with my memory so it would help if information could be written down for me, bullet points or if more complicated then a more full explanation would help."
Stradbroke,Doctors running late,1/22/2020,5,"The staff do their best, they always seem busy but always try to fit you in, doctors are running late but I understand they don't rush people. Some of the reception staff listen well. It is a high standard here."
Stradbroke,Doctors will spend time with you,12/22/2015,5,The surgery isn't too big and the doctors will spend time with you and not rush you out the door. I always see my own doctor but I've not had an urgent need to see him for some time. For non urgent appointments it is easy to book.
Stradbroke,Easy to see a GP,1/3/2019,5,Red tape can get in the way of common sense. The emergency appointment system is very good and the staff make it easy to see a GP.
Stradbroke,Emergency appointment easy to get,6/6/2022,5,"I don't often need an appointment but called for an emergency appointment this morning and found it easy to get. The triage process worked well, I received a quick call back from  a GP and now have an appointment. It's been brilliant this morning, I've been very pleased and happy with the service. I use the app to do my medication and that works well too."
Stradbroke,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Everything is good. I can always get appointments easily.  Nursing staff are very good.  I never feel rushed
Stradbroke,excellent,11/27/2015,5,we are currently receiving all the support and care we need
Stradbroke,Excellent Surgery,1/22/2020,5,This is an overall excellent surgery. I live in Fressingfield but I can drive so it is not a problem to travel to Stradbroke.
Stradbroke,Explanations are good,1/3/2019,5,I get on very well here and have no complaints at all. Staff are pleasant enough and sort things out for you. Explanations from doctors have been good and I'm happy to visit either of the surgery sites. Generally for emergency appointments  you  get one the same day and for non urgent issues it can be longer but it allows you to plan.
Stradbroke,Fantastic surgery,2/28/2023,5,"So grateful for the surgery and the staff but there is one Care Navigator who has been very difficult and their attitude is almost combative. I was told to call 111 when I wanted advice about a child’s ongoing issue, which was not appropriate. If they answer the phone when I call now I will hang up and call again in the hope of speaking to some one different.  The care and treatment provided by doctors and nurses is great and as a family we are very well looked after by the kind and reassuring staff.  As a mother and patient I definitely feel listened too and feel that everything is taken in to consideration.  With the complicated health issues my child has we are very confident in the care provided. The dispensary staff really do all they can to be helpful and have dealt with situations quickly when they’ve been more urgent.  For anything related to the children we either get a call back or are seen the same day, it really is a brilliant surgery and I really can’t praise them enough."
Stradbroke,Friendly,2/28/2023,5,"The surgery is friendly, organised and staff are helpful. There are small waits for the actual appointments and when wanting to see the clinicians. Always been a good surgery and I'm happy to attend either surgery."
Stradbroke,Friendly and approachable staff,4/27/2016,5,The staff are friendly and approachable. Nurses are brilliant and the doctors are too.They are all 100% and there is nothing that needs to be improved at the surgery.
Stradbroke,Furnishings need attention,1/3/2019,5,"At Fressingfield the furnishings are looking tired and the seating needs some attention. They always have a  valid reason if they are running late so its not a problem. Information between the hospitals doesn't seem consistent, they all say something different."
Stradbroke,Good,6/6/2022,4,"The surgery is good and offer great care. I'm usually invited in for my check ups and have no problems getting the appointments I need. It would be good if there was better communication around what and why I'm having some tests done as I'm unsure of the reasons.  I also received a letter about one of my conditions but it didn't say what I could or should be doing to help improve the issues I have, it would be good to have this information."
Stradbroke,Good consistency of GP,1/22/2020,4,I do feel that you might have to wait a little longer than I would like to but you do get a good consistency of the same GP across both surgeries.
Stradbroke,Good continuity,6/6/2022,4,"It's an approachable and friendly surgery where I have good continuity with the GP, although I don't need to visit much I've had no problems booking appointments by phone when I have."
Stradbroke,Good doctors,9/22/2016,5,They are good doctors generally but I do get to see my own doctor regularly. For me it works well and the waiting times are good too.
Stradbroke,Good overall,5/18/2015,4,My prescription always says overdue when I asked the pharmacist she said my GP should review my medication regularly but this has never been done.  I may be on medication that is not necessary.
Stradbroke,Good surgery,1/3/2019,4,Its a good surgery where you're normally called in on time.
Stradbroke,"Good surgery, good doctors and can always get appointment",6/15/2017,5,A good surgery with good doctors.  I can always get an appointment when needed and they will always see you on the day if urgent
Stradbroke,Great doctors and nurses,4/27/2016,5,"Absolutely ace. Great doctors come to Stradbroke once a week but they have a real personal approach, so wonderful. The nurses are all good and the nurse I see for my COPD checks is great."
Stradbroke,Great surgery,6/6/2022,4,"At mums previous practice when she had her INR blood taken all they did was prick her finger, the blood was tested on site and she was phoned with the results and any medication changes needed. Here, although the system works perfectly she has to have blood taken each week which is then sent off to be tested and they then call with the results. This systems seems more resource heavy when compared to her old practice in another part of the country. Could a change be considered?"
Stradbroke,Great surgery,1/3/2019,5,"A great surgery, carry on doing the same."
Stradbroke,Happy to book by phone,6/6/2022,4,The practice is good at the moment. I'm happy and prefer to book appointments by phone. I don't need to see someone specific and I'm happy to see any of the staff. I feel that the system in place works well and that there is no need for anything to change.
Stradbroke,Have waited an hour before to be seen,1/22/2020,5,"I have waited an hour to be seen here, but I am pleased that the doctor spends as much time as needed with the patient when needed."
Stradbroke,Helpful staff,1/22/2020,5,"Staff are helpful. Nurses are attentive, I see one every 6 months. Doctors are excellent I would like to know sometimes why they are delayed with their surgery. A third evening open would be useful to me."
Stradbroke,I can always get appointments,7/19/2016,5,"Everything is good.  I can always get appointments easily.  Nursing staff are very good, I never feel rushed"
Stradbroke,I don't go often,6/7/2016,4,I don't go often but there is usually a 40 minute wait after arrival
Stradbroke,I prefer calling the surgery,6/6/2022,4,I'm quite happy to see any of the staff at the practice and prefer to call to try and get appointments as I find this works well. It has taken 2 years to get to the bottom of the issue I have due to the pandemic but I've now been referred to hospital which I'm happy about. The doctors and nurses are great but I do find that some reception staff aren't as friendly as they could be.
Stradbroke,Indepth new patient review,1/3/2019,5,As a new patient my husband was looked after very well and the review was in depth which was really great. This meant that the doctors picked up on issues that needed addressing and quickly investigated things further. Really impressed with the attention to detail.
Stradbroke,It's so good!,8/24/2019,5,Comfortable with everything! This practice has stopped me moving away - it's so good!
Stradbroke,Like the system in place,1/3/2019,4,I tend to book my appointments online and have never needed an emergency appointment or one on the same day so the system works well for me.
Stradbroke,Lovely staff,1/22/2020,5,"I think this practice is underutilised. Lovely staff, Excellent surgery."
Stradbroke,Lucky to have the service,1/3/2019,5,"Very happy with the surgery, I've got no complaints at all. Seeing the same doctor is important to me and I generally get to see my doctor each time I have an appointment. I get enough information in appointments and I know we are very lucky to have the service we do here."
Stradbroke,Made to feel welcome.,8/24/2019,5,"Really good. Made to feel welcome. Normally at university, so know this is excellent by comparison."
Stradbroke,Not enough doctors,1/3/2019,4,Overall the surgery is good but there are too many people and not enough doctors. I'd like to be able to talk to a doctor even if I don't get to see one.
Stradbroke,Nurse good,1/3/2019,5,"Only had a nurse appointment and there were no problems, they are always helpful and good at what they do. The most I've had to wait is 20 mins which is ok."
Stradbroke,Outstanding team!,1/22/2020,5,"I feel that I have been here for so long that the GP's and receptionists are like friends to me. They never rush you, The GP will print off details about a condition if necessary which is helpful to take away and read. I have had nothing but good care and treatment here. We have an outstanding team here, I am very blessed."
Stradbroke,Overall very good,8/24/2019,4,Overall very good. Could use another nurse practitioner to take the weight off doctor pressure.
Stradbroke,Perfect,6/6/2022,5,"Can get appointments when needed and with in a good time too. I have a weekly INR blood test and don't have any issues getting the appointments booked. The staff are lovely and I really can't fault the surgery and how they support our family. The dispensary at the practice is amazing, they really do all they can even when there's a mistake and it's short notice."
Stradbroke,Perfectly fine,6/6/2022,5,I always phone for appointments which works really well. The triage call back was quick this morning and I was then offered a face to face appointment with a nurse which I was very happy with. The receptionists are always really lovely and helpful and get things sorted out. I mostly visit the Fressingfield branch but I'm happy to go to either.
Stradbroke,Perfectly happy,1/3/2019,5,"The surgery should carry on as it is, I'm perfectly happy."
Stradbroke,Planning ahead is more difficult,1/3/2019,4,Sometimes the customer service on reception  isn't fantastic when you are trying to sort things out. When you call they tend to only have urgent appointments available and planning ahead is more difficult. When with doctors and nurses they are good and mostly provide good explanations. I use online booking but this doesn't really help to get appointments but they are generally doing a good job.
Stradbroke,Poor communication between GP & hospital,11/16/2016,1,It seems to be that the GP and the hospital do not have any type of communication whatsoever in order to help their patients.
Stradbroke,Practice so good we moved!,8/24/2019,5,Moved up from Kent. Came to surgery when visiting - found practice so good we moved here two months ago!
Stradbroke,Quick to act,6/6/2022,5,I generally call for appointments which works well for my regular visits and I get to see the most appropriate member of staff for the issue. The staff are quick to act and responsive.
Stradbroke,Quite a wait,1/22/2020,4,"Have a long wait quite often, but it can't be helped I suppose."
Stradbroke,Satisfied,1/22/2020,5,"Its a local handy location to where I live, the parking is good and I am satisfied with my GP. No issues. Staff very good."
Stradbroke,See same GP,1/3/2019,5,Sometimes have to wait if the doctor gets called away but that's ok and I'm able to see the same doctor every time.
Stradbroke,Some receptionists are abrupt,1/22/2020,4,This is a good surgery but sadly some receptionists are abrupt on the phone.
Stradbroke,Spotless.,8/24/2019,5,Spotlessly clean. Screen check-in system very good. Went to wrong location and was told to come here. Very happy with that.
Stradbroke,Staff are great,2/28/2023,5,I really like the surgery. My diabetic care is great and I'm well monitored by nurses and staff are great and go the extra mile and I have now issues with the surgery at all.  The only thing I would like to see change is the length of the phone message which could now be shorter.
Stradbroke,Staff have time for you,4/27/2016,5,"Very friendly staff, always got time to talk and that's what makes the surgery so great. Additional opening hours especially in Stradbroke would be great. I can drive at the moment but in the future this may not be the case so getting to Fressingfield could become more difficult."
Stradbroke,Staff very good.,8/24/2019,5,Staff very good. Sometimes appointment time feels too short.
Stradbroke,Supportive and caring,1/3/2019,4,"Very supportive, caring and efficient surgeries. Underlying medical issues have been picked up and treated and I've had a quick referral to Norfolk and Norwich hospital."
Stradbroke,Takes issues seriously.,8/24/2019,4,I feel this surgery takes issue seriously and don't just pass you over. I do think I am listened to - I would like the surgery reception staff to be mindful of privacy when talking with patients. It's a good surgery. I like the fact the digital screen tells you when the GP is running late.
Stradbroke,Text information,1/22/2020,4,I like the fact that the surgery send a text reminder for appointments. It would be better if they could also send on the same text at which location the appointment is at.
Stradbroke,Text message to remind appointment is useful,8/24/2019,4,"I can't always get an appointment, I would prefer not to be asked so many questions before I see a GP. I like the GP call back. Text message to remind appointment is useful, can't they send a note when a GP is running late?"
Stradbroke,Treated well,1/22/2020,5,I am overall happy that I am treated very well at this surgery. Staff very good attitude towards patients.
Stradbroke,Very good,2/28/2023,5,A very good surgery with lovely staff. Appointments are okay to get and I like to see a specific GP if at all possible so that can mean a slightly longer wait to be seen but thats understandable.
Stradbroke,Very good,6/6/2022,5,"I like that they explain what they can and can't do and they are nice and friendly with caring staff. It would be nice if face to face appointments were more freely available. I am concerned about the future of the practice when there is so much building development planned, it would be nice to know what the surgery are doing to address the issues that will arise."
Stradbroke,Very happy,1/3/2019,5,Very happy with the service provided
Stradbroke,Very satisfied!,8/24/2019,5,Would be nice to have more chairs with backs. Very satisfied!
Stradbroke,Very Supportive,6/24/2022,5,The GP's have been very supportive over the years and always try to make things easier
Stradbroke,Wait times can be lengthy at times,2/28/2019,4,"The surgery needs to be bigger, Fressingfield has a better feel as it is bigger and the waiting area possibly needs refurbishing. There are sometimes waits to be served at the pharmacy. When you're not feeling well having to wait along time past your appointment time isn't good."
Stradbroke,waiting times annoying,1/3/2019,5,I phoned at 9.30 this morning and was given an appointment at 11.30 which is great. Waiting times at the surgery are annoying but it can't really be helped. Care provided is good and staff are great.
Stradbroke,Waiting too long at surgery,1/22/2020,4,"This is a good surgery but I find that I am kept waiting too long and without an apology, sometimes it can be up to an hour. I am always able to get an appointment and I have always found the staff to be helpful. Medication reassessment is generally prompted by me."
Stradbroke,Waiting without explanation,1/22/2020,4,"Good surgery. Waiting in the waiting room often without any explanation why it is running overtime. My husband has had problems with a receptionist when calling in, taking a sharp tone with him."
Stradbroke,Would like to see a children's corner.,8/24/2019,5,"This nurse brought in 2 children - would like to see a children's corner, something to distract and occupy."
Swan,3-5 day wait for appointment,12/2/2020,4,Unless it is an emergency appointment you have to wait at least 3-5 days for an appointment. Wait at the appointment is very long. I have to say that the staff are very good.
Swan,40 min wait at appointment,12/2/2020,4,"You do have to wait a long time at appointments, I am already 40 minutes late for mine today. BUt once you are seen its good."
Swan,a lack of kindness and compassion,8/21/2019,2,If you're struggling with a mental health issue this surgery aren't compassionate or caring and I left feeling upset and with nowhere to turn
Swan,A nice surgery,6/28/2022,4,"I've recently moved to the surgery and so far all the staff have been nice and I've found getting appointments  or prescriptions quick and easy to do.  I've been able to see the mental health link worker face to face but you do have to wait over a month, by phone it may be 1-2 weeks to chat to them and that can feel a long time."
Swan,A very good surgery,7/3/2019,5,It's a very good surgery its just a bit difficult getting through on the phone and I've waited 1/2 an hour. Once through they are all very good and staff are lovely. I have used econsult but I prefer to call up and book an appointment rather than wait a couple of days for a response. The doctors and nurses are very helpful and friendly when you see them.
Swan,A week for a call back,6/28/2022,3,I tried to speak to a GP yesterday but was told nothing was available for a week which is worrying.
Swan,Abominable Experience best avoided,11/1/2021,1,Staff don’t listen and feel unheard. Seems you have to fork out for private treatment if you you need anything.
Swan,Absolutely no continuity of service,7/23/2022,1,"When I used to be able to see the same doctor all was well. Now it is an impossibility to see the same doctor twice and I have seen a different doctor, or non doctor every time since Covid. The first appointment I can have is 11 August with yet another doctor I don’t know, or I can ring in every morning at 8.00 for the chance of a same day appointment. I am the sole carer for my husband so this is an impossibility for me as I cannot leave him at a moment’s notice.  I am more than unhappy with the service I have received and would have hoped for something a little more reassuring as I am in my 70s, a full time carer without any help for my husband and am finding this lack of continuity extremely distressing."
Swan,Access to appointments fine,5/10/2021,5,Accessing appointments is fine. I would like to see a return to face to face appointments as standard. Its a good surgery with prompt appointments and quick referrals. The receptionists are very good and friendly.
Swan,Advised to call 111,6/28/2022,3,"I called this morning at 8am but there were no appointments available by the time I spoke to reception, so they advised me to call 111 who immediately offered me an appointment at my own surgery with in 2 hrs.  I've seen a different doctor but have been very happy with the care I received. I would like to be able to see my own GP more often as I believe the continuity is beneficial to my care. Although it worked very well this morning I did have to go through 111 to get the appointment I needed."
Swan,After over 20 years I am going to unregister,6/21/2021,1,I have tried e consult twice - it failed both times and I had to call surgery for appointment - lengthy wait in a queue on the phone. The doctor couldn’t give me a time when they would call and I missed 2 calls - within 5 mins of each other ( I was driving) . The doctor did not call again m. Having just called to try to book another appointment I am told again they cannot specify when the doctor will call me - just it will be in the morning on date given. I teach so cannot be available to take a personal call all morning. In frustration and because I need to speak to a GP I am going to register at a surgery I know is seeing patients where possible and which if it does call specifies a time.
Swan,All aspects very good,1/24/2019,3,"I consider all aspects of this practice to be very good except - although I don’t call often for an appointment - it is a very, very time consuming process. I would say that 20 mins is about the norm to go through the booking process by phone and it can take longer. Also, on one occasion the automated system wasn’t working either. The care here is very, very good though."
Swan,All in all its pretty good.,5/30/2017,3,Sometimes I can wait between 10-15 minutes after appointment time but that is understandable. All in all its pretty good but parking can be a bit difficult sometimes
Swan,Always a smile,9/18/2018,4,"Receptionists aren’t always treated with respect by some people but I have always been welcomed,"
Swan,Always been good,1/26/2019,5,I have been registered here since before this current building was constructed - probably over 30 years now. It has always been a good practice and I am still very happy here. I have noticed that routine appointments are now taking a bit longer to get and it isn’t unusual to be a bit late being called in. Overall I think they manage the demand very well.
Swan,Always helpful and friendly,1/12/2021,5,"I’ve been so impressed by the GP service provided by Swan and its doctors. Before and throughout the pandemic. The e consult service is brilliant and saves so much time for minor issues. They’ve been brilliant in seeing our children very quickly if needed. Can’t praise the staff enough, from reception, doctors and nurses. All brilliant"
Swan,Always professional.,1/18/2020,5,"I found the Drs, reception staff and nurses very helpful and understanding despite their incredible workload.  The Drs have been terrific in the support and advice they've given to me.
My only gripe is that the access to the surgery is very poor. Disabled, elderly, incapacitated and mothers with prams struggle to use the entrance. The layout of the reception desk does not offer any form of privacy, and patients waiting at the desk also block the entrance/exit."
Swan,Always received excellent care.,1/18/2020,5,"Always helpful polite staff, not experienced any issues, caring staff."
Swan,Always v. good and I am v. happy with care,7/5/2018,4,Always very good - always a bit late being called in though. I've been here 7 years and very happy
Swan,Always very good,2/21/2022,5,E consult works ok for me but the drop down menu isn't great and could do with being improved to make it more user friendly. I can get appointments when I need them but when I had blood tests recently the process around the results wasn't explained  so I expected a call but after waiting a while I called the surgery to ask for the results.
Swan,Amazing physician associate,11/3/2022,5,"All staff at forest surgery , including the receptionists are an asset to this service they are kind , caring , knowledgable and compassionate. The service I have received from this practice has been exemplary. In particular one of the physician associates who has taken time to build a rapport and has responded to my needs empathetically, thoroughly and timely  whilst taking the time to listen , and actually hear what is being said. I have taken a lot of the surgery’s time the past year and I am so grateful to every single contact I have had at Forrest surgery. You have continued to operate in an inspirational manner throughout this pandemic and are a credit to the wider community. I am truly  grateful to be under your care. Thank you"
Swan,AMAZING SUPPORT,10/29/2021,5,would like to thank all staff and Drs for their support at a very  difficult time. I have found the receptionists helpful and accommodating and being able to speak to Drs at a convenient time they keep to time schedule and have assured me each time that my treatment has been needed to be reviewed and the nurses that have helped with medication review and even the assistance of giving up smoking A BIG THANK YOU
Swan,appointment at 8.30 tomorrow,1/3/2018,5,I needed a routine appointment and as I was passing I dropped in to see what was available. There were emergency appointments today but it really isn't an emergency but they were able to offer me an appointment at 8.30 tomorrow morning. First class!
Swan,Appointment is difficult and not seen on time,7/5/2018,3,"I see a particular doctor and he is very popular and thus I often have a wait after the appointment time. Booking an appointment is very difficult. Some of the consultation room (upstairs) transmit sound clearly into the waiting room and people can be overheard, especially when music is off."
Swan,Appointments are okay,6/28/2022,3,"I find getting appointments okay but getting a face to face appointment isn't particularly easy. Overall the surgery isn't too bad, just wish it was easier to get to see a doctor rather than it all being done by phone."
Swan,Appointments available,6/3/2023,5,It's a good surgery. I don't come often but appointments are available when I need them. It would be better if more blood appointments were available at the surgery as going up to the hospital costs £12 each time.
Swan,Appointments here are no problem.,1/26/2019,5,We moved here from another Bury practice as a family because we had parking problems at our previous pracrtice. We are very pleased we made the move. Drs and Nurses are good and the automated telephone appointment system works well for us.
Swan,Appointments quite hard to get,12/2/2020,3,"Its quite hard to get an appointment, often have to wait up to a week. I have identified that in the last 6 months the reception staff attitudes have improved. I generally wait 20-30 mins at appointment which can be difficult with little ones, I would like to see some children's activities."
Swan,Appointments-Good!,5/16/2017,4,I find getting appointments is good provided that you aren't worried about which doctor you see. Getting an appointment with a specific doctor can take a week or two longer.
Swan,Asthma and diabetes review,2/24/2022,5,This was my first review since before the pandemic.  The letter advising me to book a review with a nurse was a bit generic but worked ok. I had no problem booking the review or getting my blood test at the hospital. I was greeted appropriately by the member of staff on reception when I arrived and I was seen on time by the nurse. The nurse was polite knowledgeable and communicated clearly when she took blood pressure and check foot sensitivity. Very good. In retrospect it might have been better if I had been given my blood test results but I didn't ask for them so in part it was my fault.
Swan,Awful,7/11/2015,1,"This surgery used to be amazing, however it’s definitely not now. Useless phone system often not working and when it is, you can queue for 2 hours. I am now looking for a new gp as I’m sure there must be a better service than this. Awful practice now. Such a shame."
Swan,Bad experience and trouble making a complaint,6/15/2017,3,"Had a very bad experience with a doctor. Very negative attitude just a sense of anger, not so sure from who?  Problem with complaint.  Tried twice with no response 4 weeks ago!"
Swan,Best GP Surgery in Bury,6/5/2021,5,"Myself & my family have been attending Swan Surgery for years. I have always found them to be thorough, approachable and very competent. Recently the waiting times for appointments has increased but the new eConsult service is a good initiative."
Swan,Best surgery I have used,3/24/2021,5,I would highly recommend this practice to anyone local as the system is easy to book in and the doctors I have met have been brilliant and sorted everything quickly. Felt listened to and all staff I have encountered have been very friendly and helpful!
Swan,Bit of a wait and not antibiotics didnt help,6/15/2017,5,"Sometimes there is a delay
  in being called in.  I was prescribed antibiotics and i feel i got worse"
Swan,Bit of a wait on the phone,5/10/2021,5,"It's worked really well for me apart from the wait on the phone when trying to get through in the morning. I was however given an appointment and I've been pleased with the outcome, so has worked well."
Swan,Brilliant,6/3/2023,5,All been very smooth. I called this morning to arrange an appointment and have been seen today. It's a shame that continuity can't be maintained as much now because they do know you better but the care has been great. I'm totally happy with everything at the surgery and have experienced quick referrals and been well supported throughout.
Swan,Brilliant surgery,2/21/2017,5,Brilliant surgery
Swan,Busy phones,6/3/2023,5,The phones are very busy but I explained what the issue was and was given an appointment with a doctor. I've used econsult for other issues but for more urgent things I feel it is better to call the surgery as the advice is that you may have to wait up to 48 hours (working days) which gives me less confidence that I'll be dealt with quickly and therefore I prefer to call.
Swan,"Calm, professional attitude",3/12/2018,5,"I don't come here much (thankfully) but I usually get an appointment pretty quickly, never more than a week, when I feel unwell. I see different doctors on each visit but the nurses seem more settled and I have seen one more than once. There is always a calm, professional atmosphere from the moment you walk through the practice door."
Swan,Came In for my cervical screening & follow up,5/27/2022,1,"I booked in to see a nurse for my screening, I checked in 5 early. Waited and waited so 10mins past my appointment and received a text saying I has missed my appointment! Went up to reception who was fantastic but the nurse would not see me even thou she was standing in dispensary. I took time off work to come to this appointment now I have to make another and being a screening it takes some building up to because it’s not some pleasant thing! Second thing, I’m under care of addenbrooks and they have written to my gp to request prescription and we now nearly two weeks down and they still have not done it Despite having the letter the same day. Which is just delaying my start date. Swan surgery used to be so good but now it’s gone down  massively. I work in a Gp surgery so i know how busy it gets. I recommend that if someone DNA it’s always a good idear to check the waiting room just incase they are there."
Swan,Can be a bit bleak in the waiting area,12/2/2020,4,"It can be a bit bleak in the downstairs waiting area, could be brighter. It gets very full in the waiting area at times. They seem to deal with a lot of patients and it doesn't always work, but they stay on top of things."
Swan,Can’t fault it,1/22/2019,5,"I went to give blood and the tests showed that I had a problem with haemoglobin levels (so much so that they didn’t take my blood). I was advised to see my GP to get this checked out. I called an secured an appointment before I started work the following day. I was seen promptly, dealt with professionally and referred for a blood test with an instruction to come back to go through the results. The doctor couldn’t have been clearer and more reassuring."
Swan,Changes are a bit strange,5/10/2021,4,"Everything is ok, it's a bit strange with all the changes that have been put in place and getting an appointment with a doctor face to face is difficult. I've had phone consultations in the past and they've worked ok. At times I would like to see a specific doctor but I understand that this will take some time."
Swan,Children's activities?,12/2/2020,4,I would like to see some children's toys or activities in the waiting area also would be nice to have some quiet music playing in the downstairs waiting area to pass the time.
Swan,Clinical explanations are good.,8/17/2018,5,"There can be a short wait to be seen after the appointment time but if I ever need an appointment I can get one and the clinical explanations are good. I can choose which doctor I see. The nurse practitioners are excellent, outstanding."
Swan,"Clinically, fantastic",9/5/2018,5,"They can over run a bit but that's o.k because if a few extra minutes are needed in a consultation that is the trade off. The automated booking system is long winded and a bit of a pain, it seems to take a long time to listen to all of the options. I prefer to talk to some one. Clinically the practice is fantastic"
Swan,Clinically/medically pretty good,8/17/2018,4,"It is really difficult to get through on the phone at 8.00. I work full time so I am under time pressure then. It helps to know where you are in the phone queue but it doesn't seem to move very quickly. I know there are alternative ways to book but I prefer to speak to someone. That aside, clinically/medically it is all pretty good though"
Swan,Clinicians all good,6/3/2023,5,"I've had no problems getting appointments when needed and they are really organised and have invited me in on time for check ups etc. It would be helful to have a reminder text of the appointment a bit nearer the appointment as most appointments I have are booked in advance. The clinicians are all really good, I can't fault them."
Swan,Communicate information well,2/19/2019,5,I find that the medical staff generally listen to me and that they communicate information (to me) very well.
Swan,Consistent quality of care,6/10/2019,5,"Dedicated staff, top notch docs. Always feel in good hands here."
Swan,Continuity of care is important,2/18/2022,4,I do miss having face to face appointments and wonder if a video chat would be a possible option instead. Continuity of care is incredibly important when you have complicated health conditions but throughout covid I saw different people each time and it was difficult as they have differing views. I now see the same doctor which is great and helps so much. The doctor has been so good supporting me and booking appointments regularly.
Swan,Debacle with prescriptions,7/27/2020,2,I asked for a repeat prescription to be set up and issued for all three of my medications. The prescription was sent to Cambridge. When my local pharmacy finally got it back it was only for one of my drugs. Now I have to request it again and make a third trip to the pharmacy.
Swan,Delays at just about every appointment,7/5/2018,4,"I experience delay at just about every appointment. Getting an appointment isn't too bad, usually within a week."
Swan,Difficulties getting appointments,6/3/2023,3,"I have had difficulties getting an appointment and I don't easily get to see the doctor I would prefer either.  I've waited 3 weeks to have this appointment and thats difficult when I've been worried.  When you are told you will get a call back it's difficult as there is no timeframe given so I have to stay in and wait for the call.  It's not the fault of the staff, it's just appointment availability thats the problem."
Swan,Difficulty obtaining face to face appointment,7/18/2020,1,Difficult telephone contact.  Requirement to tell receptionist why I'm calling - my medical concerns and conditions are confidential. Receptionists and pharmacy staff remain polite and professional however. Brief and cursory telephone consultation no rapport with doctor.  Off hand notice on website about now closing on Saturday.  The overall feeling is that patients are just a nuisance.  This used to be a friendly and understanding surgery that sorted out your problems efficiently and with respect of its patients.  Not sure what's happened but it's all gone now.
Swan,Doctors and nurses are good,1/24/2019,4,I use the automated booking system for routine appointments and that works well for me. I can get an appointment on the day for more urgent needs. Doctors and nurses are all good in my experience and it all works well for me.
Swan,Doctors are fine,1/24/2019,2,I find that receptionists can be fairly rude. The doctors and nurses are fine. Attitude and access to appointments are the problem areas and I find that sometimes information isn’t clearly transmitted
Swan,Doctors are really good,2/19/2019,3,I phone in to make my appointments and they are harder to get (longer to wait) than used to be the case a few years ago. I always seem to be late being called in to the consultation but the doctors are really good.
Swan,Doctors are really nice,1/26/2019,4,Doctors are really nice here but reception staff can come over as rude. They don’t seem to have time and I feel as if I am an inconvenience to them. Doctors all seem very good when I mange to get in to see them though.
Swan,Doctors seem to be ok,6/29/2018,5,Some of the paintwork seems a bit shabby-the practice isn't dirty as such. I can get an appointment when I need on and the doctors seem ok.
Swan,Don't solve problems,2/13/2020,1,"I have had ongoing issues for a few years, which remain unresolved. Plenty of tests but no follow up or resolution. I have been made to feel like a hypochondriac and now wont go back to the surgery if at all possible. Doctors have told me its psychological when there have been results on tests that demonstrate medical issues.  I have frequently been asked ""what do you want to do"" but with no options or advice from huffy doctors.  I've been told to research online, but not given practical advice.  I appreciate the NHS is stretched but this surgery does not operate with any duty of care or consideration for the patient."
Swan,Dr was marvellous,1/24/2019,4,"Nurses run pretty well to time, doctors less so, probably due to the different nature of the consultations. If I could change just one thing it would be better access to appointments. I had a serious UTI (urinary tract infection) earlier this year and my doctor was marvellous. I got an early appointment and was sorted out very quickly."
Swan,Dr was very good,9/5/2018,5,I needed a home visit and when my son 'phones in I got one! Great. The doctor who came to see me was very good and he was also very nice.
Swan,Dreadful. Less than one star.,9/12/2020,1,"Condition misdiagnosed via telephone appointment so I was treated for 2 months for a condition I do not have.  After I insisted on being seen face to face my condition was diagnosed but since then there has been no consistent treatment.  All my appointments since then have been on the phone with different staff who are not qualified GPs. It seems the receptionists are now gatekeepers charged with keeping patients away from the GPs.  As a result, a condition that should have cleared up within a few weeks has been going on for 6 months and is still ongoing with no resolution in sight."
Swan,Drs and nurses are really great,3/12/2018,5,"I am usually a few minutes late being called in, which I do understand but which makes it more difficult for me to manage a fractious two year old.Once we get in though the nurses and doctors are really great with us."
Swan,Drs are good,9/5/2018,5,I can always get an appointment to suit. The doctors are all good (the one's that I have seen) and the reception staff are great and very helpful
Swan,Drs. take as much time as is needed,5/30/2017,5,There can be a slight delay after appointment time but this is because the doctors take as much time as is needed which is great!
Swan,E Consult not reliable,7/7/2022,1,"Service states contact will be made before 18:30 next day, no contact made"
Swan,E consult service- dreadful!,4/3/2022,1,I emailed 28 Feb. It's now 4 March and still no response. You can't get through on the phone either. Why offer e consult or a tel line if you can't speak or consult with anyone
Swan,E-Consult - what a waste of time,3/23/2022,1,"You publicise to use E-Consult, as can't get through on the phone, but does anyone from the surgery ever look at it. Poor service."
Swan,Econsult categories not relevant,2/18/2022,4,"I used econsult as encouraged and needed advice and a review but none of the categories seemed appropriate so I ended up being asked to call the surgery anyway. I was on hold for a while but was given an appointment quickly and I'm seeing the clinician I wanted to see. I wonder if it would be possible to be sent a link  to a booking system instead of being asked to call the surgery to get an appointment, that way you can choose an appointment that works best."
Swan,econsult does not work,3/24/2022,1,the econsult categorically promises contact back with 48 hours but it just does not happen
Swan,Econsult has been problematic,2/18/2022,4,"I've used econsult and have found it a little problematic as when I filled the form in it said I should call 111 straight away but I know it wasn't necessary and then had to work my way around it by changing what I'd written, it's just not a easy system to use."
Swan,Econsult works well,2/21/2022,5,"I've found econsult has worked well when you require an appointment but also for those that are more generic in nature. I've not had any problems getting appointments when they've been needed, never been refused and it works well."
Swan,emergency appts are always available,9/5/2018,5,There is a bit of a wait for a routine appointment but that is fine because on the day emergency appointments are always available. I'm very happy with the doctors.
Swan,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"I reported back pain and was sent to the hospital for a blood test. Within a few days the GP called me and explained that my PSA level was very high and that I would be referred for a MRI which I had within 7 days of the call. Within another 14 days I had a biopsy,  My test results were good and my PSA level has now dropped back to normal. The speed of service and quality of care by everyone was exemplary."
Swan,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,Dr was so thorough and personable
Swan,Excellent,2/18/2022,5,I can't fault the surgery. The phones are busy but I came in to the surgery and was able to get an appointment. I'm happy to see any of the doctors as they are all very good. The vaccinations that they arranged were great and the process went so well.
Swan,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,I understand there can be delays - demand is very high
Swan,Excellent,10/11/2016,5,"Very pleased with the way the nurse registered for the Live Well Suffolk programme..
All treatment and contact has been first class"
Swan,excellent - and very professional,9/21/2021,5,"I was referred here by my Woodbridge GP for a minor surgical operation yesterday.  The doctor and nurses were all extremely pleasant, professional and above all, clear in explaining what was involved in the operation and after care.  Could not fault them-"
Swan,Excellent - easy to get appointments,1/11/2016,5,"Transfer to GP from house move, very efficient.
Appointment booking efficient and speedy.  Meeting with doctor very much appreciated"
Swan,Excellent doctor and receptionist,6/8/2019,5,"I had a very positive experience with my doctor I am going through an unpleasant health event and they amazed me by their outstanding professionalism, strong work ethic, compassion and at how they took the time to ask pertinent questions and truly cared to listen to my answers, helping me tremendously... A big thank you."
Swan,Excellent helpful receptionist,3/14/2022,5,Just walked in to book an appointment for my baby who was not well. The lovely receptionist immediately found a doctor to look at her so I didn't have to come back later. It was great to have such wonderful and understanding care. Thank you.
Swan,"Excessive call wait time, an hour and19 min",4/28/2020,1,"I had a very straight forward request regarding the completion of an MCCD to assist with the online pre registration of the recent death of my wife. The online form asks if such a form has been completed. I looked for information that may help on the surgery website but could not find any and I also tried the online chat only to find it was unavailable. I have no doubt that the individuals working at the surgery are doing there very best and I make no complaint or criticism of those people doing there best. However in these very challenging times timely and effective communication, information and expectation control are more critical than ever, particularly for those going through distressing times."
Swan,Fantastic doctors and great medical staff!!,6/21/2021,5,"After a very long and stressful weekend trying to deal with 111, the swan surgery drs & staff were extremely efficient, friendly and helpful and FINALLY got my daughter the help she needed!!"
Swan,First class,4/28/2017,5,I have been attending Swan for some years now and it has always been great. First class!
Swan,Flare up of ongoing condition.,3/3/2020,4,"Seen promptly. Offered great explanations, tests and treatment plan. 
Always very impressed with this surgery. All doctors, nurses and reception staff friendly, knowledgeable, professional and helpful! Well done :)"
Swan,Flu clinic great,9/18/2018,5,"Generally I am pretty happy with the way I get looked after here. Routine visits are pretty good but the organisation around the flu clinics is outstanding. Text message information, clear instructions on times- all great!"
Swan,Focussed investigation and clear comms.,12/21/2020,5,I had a concern and was very quickly seen by a GP and referred to a specialist. It was explained that this route and urgency was a risk management process rather than a panic. We discussed family history and a number of additional tests arranged. A further follow up with all results discussed. Very impressive.
Swan,Friendly and professional,8/17/2018,5,I don't come here very often and only for routine appointments. I book online and it is very simple and quick. Check in is also easy and I have to say that my visits have always been dealt with in a friendly and professional way. I'm very happy here.
Swan,Friendly doctors and nurses,7/19/2018,5,Swan surgery has friendly doctors and nurses. The appointment system is good (I am glad it is online as well). Clear info. is provided by all
Swan,Generally good when you go in,3/12/2018,4,I am routinely called in a bit late to Drs appointments though the nurses are better. It would be better if we were advised of delays on arrival rather than sitting and wondering what is going on! The doctors and nurses are generally good when you do get in. I appreciate the quality of the service they provide.
Swan,Generally pleased with care and explanation,7/5/2018,5,I have attended for 20 years plus and I've had treatment for a chronic condition. I think that now I am expected to understand what is being done to me - they do explain if I ask them.
Swan,Generally they are pretty good here.,9/18/2018,4,I have been a patient here for just over three years and generally they have been pretty good. Usually I am seen on time but today I am one hour and fifteen minutes late being called in! This has given me time to look around and I have noticed cobwebs and dust on the blinds.
Swan,Getting an appointment is no problem.,5/30/2017,4,Getting an appointment is no problem-in fact I have never had any sort of problem here.
Swan,Getting an appointment isn't bad,5/16/2017,4,"Getting an appointment isn't bad 4-5 days at worst. The telephone calls, however, can take quite a long time. I haven't seen my named doctor for about 5 years"
Swan,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Had an econsult last week and a call yesterday and then invited in to see the doctor today and happy with how its all worked. The staff are good when you do see them but I do feel there are certain circumstances when having a phone call from a doctor is just not necessary and you should be given an appointment with them straight away.  Having said that I have always been seen when I've needed to, its just a bit more hassle having the call back.  The children have always been seen on the the day of calling which is good."
Swan,Good but...,2/22/2022,3,The care and access more recently has been very good and I find that the triage process in place works well for general appointments but the end of life care a family member received was lacking in care and compassion which was very disappointing. When the doctor arrived  they didn't ask for them by name just called them the patient and the visit was done in a cold manner which was really disappointing.
Swan,Good efficient service,2/8/2020,4,"Needed print out of medical history, used online request form and was ready the next day. Staff were friendly on collection"
Swan,Good local GP,10/13/2022,5,Sometimes a bit of a faff to get an appointment but once you get to see the doctor can't fault them. GPs all very pleasant. Five stars.
Swan,Good practice,5/30/2017,5,This is a good practice. I have been coming here for years and I never have any problem getting an appointment
Swan,"Good, friendly practice",2/19/2019,4,"I find this to be a good, friendly practice. The nurses and doctors that I have seen have all been reassuring and professional. I suppose really it is all about the clinical consultation but the 'wrap around' parts of the surgery, reception, admin, appointment system are all pretty good as well. I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about how well the surgery performs but in retrospect it has always supported me very well."
Swan,Got to see a GP today,5/10/2021,4,"I've had no problems getting to see a doctor today, it all worked quite smoothly and quickly. I'm confident in the staff and the care they provide."
Swan,GP understood,3/23/2016,5,My GP understood my concerns and apologised that I had to wait.
Swan,Great Consultation with GP,10/18/2020,4,Doctor helped with female problems and I felt understood and heard. Professional and caring.
Swan,"Great GP, when I can get into see her",2/17/2020,3,My doctor is great but the overall service from the practice has gone down hill. It's very hard to get them to answer the phone and I now have to wait a month for an appointment with my doctor. They seem good with emergency appointments but not great for continuing care.
Swan,Great practice and staff,9/10/2020,5,Always supportive and helpful staff.
Swan,Had to wait 45mins for appointment,10/13/2022,2,"Got to surgery at 8.35 am for appointment at 8.45am. I had to wait about 40mins after appointment time.   I asked at reception on two occasions and was told Nurse  had a problem with her login on computer ( which is understandable)    I fully understand that the Surgery  has had a vast increase in patients numbers. 
Going forward would it be a good idea for Nurse/Dr to inform  reception staff  they could pass information to patients if problems occur. 
My Nurse  did apologies for delay, this  is just to make you aware of how frustrating  it is  from a patients point."
Swan,Happy with care,2/21/2022,5,"I'm happy with the care I receive. For this appointment I did an econsult, a phone appointment was organised followed by tests and I'm seeing the GP today so the whole process has worked really well. The doctor I'm seeing is really thorough and gives me confidence."
Swan,Hard to get an appointment,6/3/2023,2,"I called yesterday to try and get an appointment for a child to be seen with a suspected broken finger but none were avaialble, instead we had to go up to A&E."
Swan,Have struggled to get appointments,2/21/2022,4,It's been hard to get appointments but today's was booked by my support worker really easily. I feel I need more training and advice to be able to take my diabetes medication but general advice around other aspects has been good.
Swan,have to make an appointment weeks in advance,2/23/2020,1,Have to make an appointment weeks in advance. Rubbish.
Swan,Helped me twice now,5/9/2018,5,I have a chronic chest condition which can 'flair up' with little warning. Twice in the past month I have become suddenly quite unwell and both times I was given an emergency 'on the day' consultation. Very reassuring to have this kind of medical support available to me.
Swan,Helpful staff,6/3/2023,5,"I've been invited in for a regular check up and I find the staff really helpful when contacting the surgery. I tend to use both online and phone to arrange appointments or get help, both have their place and work well."
Swan,I am happy here,3/12/2018,5,"Nurses usually run pretty well on time but doctors less so. Appointments are reasonably easy to get when I am unwell. Overall, I am happy to be a patient at this practice. They met my needs well."
Swan,I am very pleased that I came here,6/29/2018,5,I transferred here at the suggestion of a friend (because I was always moaning about my previous surgery). I am very pleased I came here. All good so far.
Swan,I don't like the telephone system,9/5/2018,4,I don't like the automated telephone appointment booking system. i.e. Press 1-Press 2-it's too messy. I can only attend the practice on a Monday or a Tuesday but it seems to take forever to have to listen to all the other days to find a Mon/Tues appointment. Far better to deal with a person
Swan,I feel blessed to have found such a good GP.,10/28/2019,5,"Since I had my initial appointment with my GP on the off chance 3 years ago, I have been genuinely so pleased with my care from him. Nothing is ever too much trouble and always takes the time to listen to me and help me."
Swan,I feel well managed,9/26/2018,5,I became a patient here some 14 years ago when I transferred from another practice in the town. I moved because I didn't think my chronic conditions were being managed holistically. It took a while to sort my medications out in the first few months but I am now very stable and I feel well managed.
Swan,I have always been treated well by all Staff.,10/28/2019,5,"I have had nothing but good support from all Doctors that I have seen over the nine years that I have been at the surgery. I have been seen for my Depression and other very important issues and every time they have dealt with it, being hospitalised or through medication."
Swan,I have never had a bad experience,7/12/2018,5,We (my family and I) are extremely lucky to be registered here. I have never had a bad experience or anything like a bad experience.
Swan,I have to push reception,2/5/2018,4,I have been told that appointments 'on the day' should always be available for my child.. That has not been my experience. I have had to push reception to be invited to come to the surgery and sit and wait for an apointment
Swan,I like to see a specific GP,9/5/2018,4,I like to see a specific GP for my ongoing treatment. This can take time and appointments can be up to four weeks. That said I'm not always around so that may be a factor in this timescale. Perhaps more surprisingly I am having to wait till 21st of the month (8th today) for a telephone appointment.
Swan,I really rate my doctor,2/19/2019,5,"I have always had a good experience here and I have been registered about ten years. I really rate my doctor - I choose to wait the two to three weeks that it takes to get an appointment with him specifically. He always looks at me and listens when I am talking (not distracted by computer screen). If I am really poorly, or one of my children is ill, I have always been able to get an 'on the day' appointment."
Swan,I see the same doctor,1/24/2019,5,I see the same doctor pretty well each time I book and that suits me. I consider them to be good and professional and I value the continuity of care. If it is an emergency appointment I am happy to see whoever is available
Swan,Impossible to ever get through on the phone,6/6/2022,1,"Several times I have tried to call the surgery, however, I work full time, only get a 30mins for lunch.  Today when I rang in my lunch hour I was number 10 in the queue. Why is it that the surgery is no longer open on Saturday at the least for admin or the pharmacy.  For someone who works full time, it makes getting to the surgery very difficult and when you cannot speak on the phone it is very frustrating."
Swan,Impossible to get an appointment or response,10/5/2021,1,"No one answers the phone or emails despite me completing eConsult and being advised to see a GP ASAP, appalling."
Swan,Impossible to get appointments,1/11/2021,1,Impossible to get appointments unless you want to wait 3 weeks. Even in an emergency they have no appointments. Much easier to call 111. They also forgot to include me on the covid jab list so I had to get mine another way even though I'm high risk. Currently looking for another surgery.
Swan,It all works very well for me,2/19/2019,5,I have been registered here for about six years having moved to the area. It all works very well for me. I use online booking for routine appointments and on the very odd occasion that I need an emergency 'on the day' appointment I phone in and I have never been disappointed. I see nurses more than doctors and they are great.
Swan,it is now very good.,8/17/2018,5,I (and my husband) have been patients here for about eight years. The surgery has improved over that time and is now very good. The only small point is that the hospital say they can only see my summary care records-not the whole thing.
Swan,It suits me absolutely,7/12/2018,5,I am very happy to be a patient here. I can get an appointment in a sensible time and it is a very welcoming environment. It suits me absolutely
Swan,Lack of communication,7/8/2021,1,"Disappointing experience. Waited in until 2.30 for call back. Went out, had mobile, didn’t get to answer in time. Rang surgery straight back, too 15 minutes to get through. Answerphone message very out of date. Spoke to receptionist, advised I was on mobile and for nurse practitioner to phone back on that, kept phone very close. When home, nurse practitioner had left message on home saying they had tried to phone me twice and I would need to do new e-consult."
Swan,Left feeling unheard,7/14/2021,1,Unfortunately I get the impression that the Drs are overwhelmed with too many patients and over all I felt rushed leaving me to feeling unheard.
Swan,Long phone waits,5/10/2021,4,"I have had a long wait, half an hour, to get through this morning. Staff are very very friendly, particularly the pharmacist who is very helpful. Staff have mentioned using e consult but I haven't used it yet as I'm not really sure how it works. Having the parking at the surgery is great, makes such a difference and so much easier."
Swan,long waiting times,6/15/2017,4,Sometimes there is a wait after the appointment time.  I have visited 3 times in 2 weeks and delayed each time
Swan,Lovely surgery,6/3/2023,4,"Its a lovely surgery but hard to get an appointment, it's taken 6 weeks to get this one with a specific doctor. I do prefer to see the same doctor if at all possible. Although I've waited 6 weeks I'm now seeing someone different anyway due to unforeseen circumstances.  I just find that when you see someone different each time you have to go over your history. The doctor I saw today was brilliant and very supportive so it's all worked out well.  When I've used econsult in the past to contact the surgery I was told an appointment was arranged but when I've turned up there have been no records so I've lost confidence in the system now and prefer to call."
Swan,Marvellous,1/26/2019,5,If you come in here with a real problem they are marvellous. My husband has an enduring illness and he can become quite bad very quickly. In those circumstances the reception staff can always find a way to fit him in. Online system doesn’t work well for us though.
Swan,Max 3 day wait for appointment,12/2/2020,4,I usually have to wait a maximum of 3 days for an appointment. But I am fine with this surgery no issues.
Swan,Medical staff great. Management atrocious,9/10/2020,1,"You can be waiting over an hour for the phone to be  answered. Only one receptionist, and she was having to leave her desk to check on incoming patients ( who were forced to wait outside the surgery). I was sent to the hospital for a blood test, only to be told on arrival that, due to a national problem, blood tests cannot be currently taken. Swan surgery had been made aware of this several days before they sent me for the test. 
Stop using Covid-19 as an excuse. Get up to date management systems in place"
Swan,Mental health,4/24/2020,5,"I’ve never had such understanding doctors, who really care, genuinely want to help and they never try to move you on quickly. The support I’ve received from them as doctors are better than any support I’ve received from doctors in the whole 25 years of my life and I’ve been with them for 3 months. I have recommended all my loved ones to swap doctors."
Swan,Miss seeing the doctors,6/28/2022,5,I find it difficult to see a doctor but I was given an appointment with the nurse practitioner for today a month ago.  I've spoke to the doctor on the phone and they said to get bloods done and to have a face to face when the results are back so it has worked well really. On the whole a very good surgery with very nice and helpful staff.
Swan,Mixed experience but great surgery,2/8/2018,4,Bitten by dog. Home treated.I collected medication. Realised worth checking if bite could be seen. Asked pharmacist if there was a nurse on site. Told there was and to speak to receptionist. Receptionist offered appointment in the week. Nurse couldn't see that morning as appointments booked. I think Swan surgery is a great surgery but I left without the injury being triaged which feels inappropriate. I feel it should have been looked at and either told to go to A&E or temporarily dressed / treated there for a re-appointment early in the week. I would have been happy to wait at surgery for nurse and it wouldn't have taken much time. Consequences of non-triaging could have been worse. I happen to have some knowledge that meant I could avoid going to A&E.
Swan,More difficult than used to be,6/21/2022,3,"It's more difficult than it used to be to see someone face to face. I've called for an appointment only to be told to call back the next day when there were no appointments left.  When this happened today reception advised I should call 111 and they then arranged for me to have an appointment later that morning at the surgery, even though I told them exactly the same information as I told reception. I've also submitted an econsult which said I needed to be seen and to call the surgery but I've then been given a face to face appointment in a couple of weeks."
Swan,My doctor is absolutely fantastic,7/5/2018,5,My doctor is absolutely fantastic. He takes note of what I say and his advice is great. It is so much better than where I went before.
Swan,My doctor is fantastic,1/24/2019,5,"I have found one of the nurses to be very rude - this has been persistent so I no longer see her. That said my doctor is fantastic, he is prepared to sit and listen which is good though he does sometimes run a bit late. Last week a nurse was 45 mins late and apologised to me by telling me she hadn’t been able to ‘get rid of’ patient. I thought that was more than I needed to know but it would have helped if I had known there would be a delay."
Swan,Never a problem,5/30/2017,5,I have been here approximately 15 years and they look after me very well-there is never a problem!
Swan,no complaints whatsoever,5/30/2017,5,I have no complaints whatsoever. I call into make my appointments and there is never a problem-it's great!
Swan,No issues,2/22/2022,5,I've had no issues getting appointments. I tend to call for them but have used econsult in the past. I did find it didn't work as smoothly as I would've hoped so it is easier to call. Staff explain things well and I'm happy with how it's all working at the moment.
Swan,No quick appointments,5/10/2021,3,I can't get a blood pressure check even though my machine at home is reading very low. Recently I've booked two GP appointments but both were cancelled. The last cancellation meant that when I did see a GP three weeks later I was sent straight to hospital. If I'd been seen earlier I would've gone then.
Swan,Nobody cares,3/12/2019,2,"Ongoing pain since 9, even resulting in a trip to A&E. Drs at this surgery have done nothing but fob me off (not even pretending to care, very unsympathetic staff) and I've been pushed from pillar to post. Never ever seen the same Dr/nurse. Offered an appointment 2 weeks away - what use is that?"
Swan,Not a great experience,5/10/2021,2,This time has not been great. I was on hold for 47 minutes on the phone yesterday morning and by the time I got through there were no appointments available.I was told to call back this morning but considering the age of our baby its quite concerning that we couldn't be seen. There was no offer of a call back so we ended up having to call 111 overnight. We then called again this morning and were given an appointment.
Swan,Not always sure I am sitting in right area!,12/2/2020,4,"Waiting at the appointment is very long and this seems to be every time I come to the doctors. 9 out of 10 times I always get an appointment within a week and they would also offer a call back if I wanted it. I am not always sure that I am sitting in the right area of the surgery, it can be complicated at check in where to go and the areas are not clearly signed."
Swan,Not being given Diagnosis,5/23/2020,2,"Finding out that I have an issue with my Heart, when I got my Medical Records, and not being told ?!"
Swan,Not great,6/29/2021,3,I've struggled to get  a face to face appointment with a doctor and when I saw the nurse practitioner they were very dismissive of the concerns I had. I don't know who my own GP is anymore and it used to be easy to get to see someone and it was such a lovely surgery.
Swan,Not satisfied,5/24/2021,2,"It is been 10 months, that I wanted to do a blood test to check my sugar level. They asked me to feel twice the E-consult which is very time consuming and irrelevant questions. Then when they told me to book on hospital for blood test, and I went there they said they only do the priority due to Covid despite of being booked, and I could not do the test on that day, while  I had to be be absent some hours from my work. Finally I did the test, and I had to call to ask them to send the results to my home, which I wonder why they do not do it automatically. Finally I recieved the results and there is everything there except the cholestrol and glucose that I needed to check. I am so disappointed. However, I should admit and thank for well organised vaccination service."
Swan,"Nurse practitioners are really, really good",8/17/2018,4,"I can be up to 15 mins late going in to my appointment. That said, I can phone in and always get an appointment which is a plus. This is the third time I have had to come back for the same condition, it seems if some doctors listen more carefully and probe than others. Nurse practitioners are really, really good"
Swan,Online booking system is great,2/19/2019,5,I book online and the system is great. I can't make nurse appointments online but they specialise so I understand why. Text confirmations (of appointments) and reminders are a real bonus.
Swan,Overall I am pretty happy,1/26/2019,5,Overall I am pretty happy being a patient here. I can always get an appointment in a reasonable time and the staff are always very professional.
Swan,Overall I am very happy,1/26/2019,4,There are ‘niggly’ things that annoy me a bit. I get invitations every year to come in for a flu jab and every year I decline and ask to be taken off the list but it doesn’t happen! A while back there was a member of the reception team who was a bit ‘sharp’ in her communication but she seems to no longer be around. All of that said I am very happy here and I wouldn’t want to have to move to another practice.
Swan,"Overall very happy, but waiting times are long",6/15/2017,4,Overall I am very happy - late at appointments is only thing to comment on
Swan,"Overall, GP advice is brilliant",9/5/2018,5,The reception staff aren't always very polite to me but overall the GP advice is brilliant. I'm happy to be a patient here.
Swan,Pfizer vaccinations,6/1/2021,5,"Very impressed with the very professional way the whole experience was carried out from being met at the door to handing in the timers. Every member of Staff was helpful, pleasant and had a smile on their faces. Thank you and well done Swan Surgery!"
Swan,Phone consultation not enough,2/22/2022,3,Mostly I've had phone consultations but I don't feel that this is always enough. It's taken two weeks to get a phone appointment to discuss being referred to a specialist.
Swan,"Poor GP, zero guidance or help",6/20/2023,1,"GP was non-sympathetic, and did not help in any way. They were grumpy, and the advice given was common sense. If I wanted common sense I wouldn’t use a professional service. 
Do not recommend."
Swan,Poor service,6/16/2022,1,"Takes forever to answer the call even if you’re in queue number 1. 
Doesn’t do face to face assessment frequently.
Does assessment on telephone triage only. There is a big difference between face to face and just telephone assessment.
Too slow on processing form/GP summary requests."
Swan,"Poor service, don’t listen",10/13/2020,1,If you get the right receptionist you can get an appointment but get the wrong one can only get an appointment next week
Swan,"Poor, poor and drivel",9/30/2020,1,"Forest surgery. Having to wait yet another two weeks to talk to a doctor over suspect heart trouble. Only been going on for three months. Doctors are great when you actually talk to them. Not great for mental health, I suppose that will be stored up for the future."
Swan,Pretty good little practice,3/12/2018,5,"One particular person on reception can be a bit grumpy but otherwise it is pretty good in all areas-appointments, quality of clinicians, etc. Pretty good little practice all round in my opinion."
Swan,Pretty much ok,6/29/2018,5,I don't attend very often but when I do it is pretty much ok. I never see the same doctor twice in a row but that doesn't really matter to me.
Swan,Quick to get covid jab,2/22/2022,5,"It was really quick and easy to get my first covid jab, I called the surgery and they fitted me in today which was really good."
Swan,"Quick, friendly and efficient",9/18/2018,5,"I arrived for drop in flu jab clinic at 8 30 which was the start time, There was already a queue but I was checked in quickly and the queue moved pretty fast. The nurse was friendly and efficient and I was out of the surgery within 15 minutes. Very good."
Swan,Really good surgery,6/3/2023,5,"I've not needed to use the surgery much but when I have I've easily got appointments by calling the surgery. I've seen the Emergency Care Practitioner who is very good, so caring and their whole manner is just wonderful. The surgery works really well the only small issue I've had is getting medication. I've had to take my prescription else where when medication including needles for my insulin haven't been available."
Swan,Removed from list,6/20/2022,2,"I've been taken off the practice list after being with the surgery for years as I am 1/3 of a mile outside the boundary, it seems very unfair."
Swan,Same day appointment with thorough caring GP,3/29/2023,5,"I was offered a same day appointment. The GP was caring, understanding, really thorough and proactive in ensuring I was able to gain the help and treatment I required. He was respectful, didn’t rush and explained his thinking so I went away feeling listened to, informed and with a plan."
Swan,Simple system,5/10/2021,4,I spoke with reception this morning and was given an appointment with a doctor so from my perspective it's working well at the moment.
Swan,Slow econsult response,12/4/2023,3,"I completed an econsult and received a notification that I would get a response in up to 48 hours, however, I received the reply 5 working days after I first submitted the form which was worrying. Normally it's a good surgery and the staff are very good when you do see them.  I was asked to complete a blood pressure form with a weeks worth of readings and notified the staff member that I would need to purchase a blood pressure machine before I could start recording the readings.  I was sent an online form to complete but by the time I purchased the machine and then tried to submit the readings access to the form had closed. Because I had another appointment already booked I arranged to take the results in to the appointment rather than requesting a new form to complete.  It would be good if the form could stay live for a longer period in case there are any delays."
Swan,So so,6/21/2022,3,"It's not too bad, and appointments are so so. I do still find that face to face appointments aren't particularly available."
Swan,Social prescribing,8/4/2016,4,I have heard about social prescribing and would like to ask you to consider it because of the huge benefits it can offer.
Swan,Sometimes difficult to get an appointment,2/5/2018,4,I have been a patient here pretty well since it opened. I find that now it is sometimes difficult to get an appointment with one of the established Doctors (partners). This can be a 3-4 week delay. I have a chronic disorder so continuity is important to me but sometimes I have to compromise by seeing another Doctor.
Swan,Staff are good,6/3/2023,5,"Appointments to see the nurses are no problem to get. They are so good, I'm visiting twice a week at the moment and they are always so lovely.  Appointments with doctors are a different story, mainly I've had them 3 weeks after booking and that's not even always with my prefered doctor.  They then run behind which can be frustrating.  I have just seen a wonderful doctor who I try to see if at all possible but they are so good everyone wants to see them.  The Physicians Associate is also very good, very thorough and great care, I've been very pleased with them when I've seen them."
Swan,Steriod Injection in shoulder - painless!!,1/9/2021,5,I was referred via my physio for a steroid injection in my shoulder. I had been informed by various people that this procedure was painful. I booked in and they performed this procedure and explained everything to me and the injection was painless! I was so shocked and amazed by how professional the doctor was in making this whole experience stress free and not at all painful! I cannot recommend the GP enough for this type of procedure if needed or if you are feeling nervous about the injection.
Swan,Still waiting,10/19/2016,3,I receieved a text message from the surgery in Sept telling me they would be in touch soon to arrange a flu jab. It's now October and I am still waiting. Clinically it's a good practice but the administration is very poor.
Swan,Telephone consults,6/23/2022,5,"I have had two phone consults with GPs at the practice and I have been so pleasantly surprised by the obvious effort and care they put into their jobs. Other GP practices I have been to have often felt like they are simply trying to give you the quickest solution to get rid of you, but I found that here they put in time in to talk me through different options and solutions and made me feel like they genuinely cared. Thank you!!"
Swan,Telephone glitch,8/17/2016,3,"I was unwell over a weekend and telephoned the surgery on Monday morning to make an appointment. My call wasn't answered so I got up, washed, dressed and drove to the surgery with the call still ringing. 
I approached reception (where there was no audible telephone ringing though my phone showed the call as still connected and I was still getting the recorded message. I checked that I was using the correct number with the receptionist and when she said I was I asked why I hadn't been answered for 52 minutes. Her response was to ask which option I had chosen and (probably unhelpfully on reflection) I asked which of the options they ignored for 52 minutes. 
I pointed out that there appeared to be a difficulty with their 'phone system and asked that they check it and let me know what they had found. Two and a bit weeks now and no word........ This is a real shame as the clinicians are excellent but back office very poor."
Swan,Telephone response can be a bit random.,9/26/2018,4,"I have three children and so I probably use the surgery more than most people one way or another. I am and always have been, very happy with the service here. The only blip is that sometimes it can take a while to get an answer-not always but on the odd occasion I have been listening to pretty repetitive music for 10-15 minutes."
Swan,Terrible,10/13/2020,1,Poor management and try to avoid giving the treatment you need. Have to have several consultations to get anywhere
Swan,The doctor at the surgery really listened,7/26/2022,5,"The doctor I saw was the first doctor to really take my mental health seriously. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for many years, tried counselling, tried switching contraception, a multitude of different things but nothing worked. The doctor took my symptoms seriously and put me on medication, and with other suggestions, I have felt a huge improvement. Thank you."
Swan,The nursing team could improve,1/11/2019,3,"Generally the DRs appointments are good, you’re listened to and things are explained. The nurses on the other hand have little bedside manner or compassion and are rude and brusque and rush you in and out as quickly as they can. Also receptionists don’t answer phones for sometimes 15/20 minutes, when I mentioned this to them one said ‘you’re lucky sometimes it takes 25!’ Rude and unprofessional."
Swan,They all do a good job,2/19/2019,5,"It all works ok when I need it, which thankfully is quite rare. I don't see the same doctor (on different visits) but I come so infrequently that it doesn't matter. They all do a good job and that is what matters to me."
Swan,They are very good,1/26/2019,4,"I try to avoid coming in here if I can. I talk to my pharmacist or get guidance on line. But when I do need to come in they are very good. Appointments aren’t bad to get and all the doctors that I have seen have seemed very good, they can run a bit late though."
Swan,They have all been so good,7/5/2018,5,I've only been here a year but they have all been so good. Made me confident to ask questions. Most reception staff are brilliant but recently one member of staff was very rude and shouted at me. This was most upsetting and breached my confidentiality as they could be overheard.
Swan,They really couldn't do more,7/12/2018,5,I am very happy at how I am looked after here. They really couldn't do more
Swan,They really try to help,9/5/2018,5,"The clinicians always listen to me and they really try to help. Getting an appointment is fine-really, for me, it is all good."
Swan,They were brilliant,3/12/2018,5,The loos here can be a bit 'iffy' on occasion. Some receptionists could do with being a bit more cheerful. Routine appointments can be up to a week but they were brilliant at sending me to GP Plus when they didn't have any appointments to offer me.
Swan,This is a good practice,6/29/2018,5,This is a good practice. Compared to what I hear on the radio about other surgeries we are blessed here. I've more than a few days for a routine practice and the doctors are all good.e never had to wait
Swan,This practice suits me very well.,7/12/2018,5,This practice suits me very well-it is absolutely brilliant! I transferred here because I felt I wasn't listened to at my previous practice. Every single person I have seen here has been great.
Swan,Treated like a Real Person,12/2/2020,4,"I feel that I am treated well here, like a real person during appointments. A good surgery. I would like to see water available in all waiting areas and the children need things to keep them occupied and it would be helpful if it could be communicated to patients if the doctors are running late."
Swan,uncarering not offering further suport,12/31/2019,1,"they didnt do what i call an appointment to welcome us to the surgery and get to know us and discuss our problems and why and whaat medcine we are on,,,, diagnosed with low diabetes and not offered any sort of dieting or help or a diabetic nurse or anything other than another blood test in 3 months and some tablets"
Swan,Unfriendly,2/24/2021,1,"Dr was rude & abrupt, very unhelpful."
Swan,Untrained staff,10/14/2020,1,Consulting with different GPS causes a lack of consistency and means you have to repeat yourself every time you need to speak with a Dr regarding your health. A more streamlined and better management system would create and foster better care of patients
Swan,Up to 2 weeks wait for appointment,12/2/2020,2,"You have to wait weeks for an appointment and I would regularly expect to wait 40 minutes plus at the appointment which is too long. I have to wait up to 2 weeks for an appointment and if I wanted to see a specific doctor such as a female GP it would be often up to 4 weeks wait! Staff are very good both medical and non medical and it is also worth mentioning that the staff in the dispensary are very good too, they seem to need more doctors."
Swan,Use the webpage,8/1/2021,4,I have used the website today for a perscription I am hoping it gets looked at and prescribed as required.
Swan,Used e consult,4/10/2021,5,"Used e consult almost immediate response - then contacted with an appointment - felt safe,listened to cannot fault the service care and attention"
Swan,Used e-consult for first time,7/21/2021,5,"I used the e-consult services for the first time and found it very quick and easy to use . After filling in the online form I was informed that I would get a call from the doctor the next day . I was called at 3-15 and after explaining my condition was asked to attend a face to face appointment for 3-45 the same day , I was examined and found to have a viral infection and issued with a prescription. Excellent service from the doctor as usual."
Swan,usually I can get a routine appointment,2/5/2018,4,I was once 25 minutes late being seen but I realise these things can happen. It can be difficult to get through on 'phone to make an appointment but I can usually get a routine appointment within a week. All the clinicians that I have had contact with have been pretty good.
Swan,Very easy to make an appointment,5/16/2017,4,Sometimes I have to sit in the waiting room a bit of a while but it is very easy to get an appointment. I made this appointment today for today
Swan,Very good,8/27/2020,4,"Whether in surgery or by telephone, the Doctor is always very courteous and very helpful."
Swan,Very good at the moment,2/22/2022,5,"The phones are busy but the mix of telephone and face to face appointments works really well. I like that there is good continuity with the doctors as this really helps. My child has a learning disability, she hadn't had an annual review but its now been done and it was a really great experience which was done to the member of staff who did it."
Swan,Very good treatment and helpful,10/16/2017,5,"I went for my flu jab a week ago last Saturday. I had forgotten despite text reminders and I arrived a minute or two after the clinic was supposed to have finished. Reception staff checked and said I could be seen. Dr not only gave me a painless injection but took the time to enquire about my asthma symptoms and refer me for a blood test-very, very good!"
Swan,Very happy,2/22/2022,5,I called this morning as I needed to see a doctor and was given an appointment almost straight away so I can't fault the system that is in place at them moment.
Swan,Very helpful,10/23/2021,5,"My husband was very unwell at the end of July, after a few days phoned the surgery and had telephone consultation, the doctor said to bring husband to surgery if possible, was given antibiotics but he worsened in the afternoon and the GP arranged an ambulance to take him to hospital. He stayed there for nearly a week with pneumonia. Wrote a message to thank [them] for [their] kindness but discovered [they were] a locum so not sure if [they] got it. I was reluctant to phone twice on same day during present covid times but receptionist was also very understanding"
Swan,Very Helpful from reception to Doctor,10/29/2021,5,"I have had a real mix of Issues since moving to Bury St Edmunds I am so glad that I chose Swan Surgery. The help and the assistance I have received from Receptionists to Nurses assisting giving up smoking to the care from the Doctors has been amazing, cannot fault and I think we all need to really think that at times like now we have to protect these invaluable members so that they are here when we need them. Pubs are shut for 2 weeks as all members have covid, could you imagine your drs fully shut for 2 weeks? [...] Thank you for being there."
Swan,Very pleased,6/3/2023,5,"I called this morning and have been given an appointment with the duty doctor. I've used econsult and have found it quick to deal with my issues but for the kids its not quite so good as it can throw you out and often says to call the surgery any way. The Emergency Care Practitioner has been great, really compassionate and a great manner, a real credit to the surgery. I also find the in house dispensary very good, very responsive and quick to get medication ready. It really is a great surgery."
Swan,Very pleased,2/5/2018,5,We were patients here until 2004 when we went to live in Ireland. We came back last year and re-registered and we are very pleased at how good the practice continues to be.
Swan,Very pleased with care and appointment system,7/5/2018,5,"I have to have a blood test every 6 weeks (for 20 years). I always get forms from reception. Last time reception said it needed authorisation. First time in 20 years! My doctor is fantastic though. Emergency appointment is very good - 3 to 4 weeks for my named doctor but I can talk to her on the phone earlier, if I need to."
Swan,Very reliable surgery,1/22/2019,5,I manage a team that support a group of people with learning disabilities and various other challenges to live as independently as they are able. Our residents use Swan Surgery and they all like the people who look after them there.
Swan,Very satisfied with care and service,4/5/2017,4,Very satisfied with level of care and service provided.  Requested to remain with Swan when moved home from Bury St. Edmunds to Ixworth
Swan,Wait a week for an appointment,12/2/2020,4,I normally have to wait for a week to get an appointment with a doctor. I can't think of any other improvements needed.
Swan,Waited 4 weeks to see specific doctor,6/28/2022,3,I've waited 4 weeks to see a specific doctor and I've ended up not seeing them anyway so I could've been seen quicker. I do feel that appointments are easier to access at the moment but the phones are very busy first thing in the morning. The staff are very pleasant when you do get to see them or speak to them on the phone.
Swan,Waiting 6 weeks to see my Gp is unacceptable.,8/1/2020,1,"Every time I need to see my GP I have to wait 6 weeks !! It’s unacceptable and disgraceful. There are only 3 Doctors I would see, and recommend for their caring and supportive nature. Sadly the waiting times need improving, and I don’t see it improving anytime soon. I don’t agree with the Receptionists wanting to know why I want to see a Doctor, because they are neither Medics or Medically trained. 
5 years ago, you could get an Appointment the following day, but not today. 
On a Positive Note ; Dr (name removed) is a Godsend and is very Proactive in getting things done ! He’s a fantastic GP."
Swan,waiting times are increasing,3/30/2016,4,Waiting times to see your own doctor are increasing-2 weeks sometimes. This means that older people are losing the relationship with their doctors sometimes.
Swan,Was told I had a double appointment,8/25/2021,1,"3 mins into the call the Dr asked why I was calling because Normally people call their dr for something. I was told as I have serious trauma related problems, I should speak to Dr (name removed) every 2 months to check-in. Dr (name removed) has left. Personally, I find it rude that I’m not receiving the same standard as Dr (name removed) practiced. As we the patients are the customer, it’s just rude to try and rush the call and as I have memory and concentration problems, plus trouble communicating. Pointing out time restrictions 3 mins into the call I find rude. They don’t have time for patients."
Swan,Welcoming and professional,6/29/2018,4,Generally I have no complaints with the surgery. I find them welcoming and very professional.
Swan,Well supported,2/22/2022,5,Normally have to wait  only a few days for an appointment. The phones can be busy and it can mean a bit of a wait at times but I feel that I get the care and support that I need. My baby had their immunizations and 6 week check done on time and I've been well supported throughout.
Swan,What we had is lost,5/10/2021,2,A feeling that you can't see a doctor face to face anymore and that all they'll do is chat with you on the phone which isn't what is needed at times. What we had has been lost and it appears that face to face appointments are seen as unnecessary now.
Swan,Wonderful,5/10/2021,5,"All wonderful especially the friendly receptionists. It works very well here and you can get appointments 
 when needed, they are really good."
Swan,Would like to see more follow up,12/2/2020,3,"Getting appointment is pretty good, but I would like to see more follow up especially if a treatment pattern has been followed."
Swan,Wouldn't want to  change practices,6/15/2017,5,Been here since a baby- great .  I really wouldn't want to change practices
The Derby,3 star,5/8/2015,3,3 star
The Derby,3 star,9/16/2015,3,3 star
The Derby,3 weeks to get an appointment,3/16/2018,1,The telephone answering system is slow and not user friendly. When you do get through the receptionist tells us its 3 weeks to get an appointment. We phoned at 6pm and are told the doctor won't have time to phone us back. Received conflicting advice from 3 different receptionists in relation to getting printed medical records for my son. The receptionists made my life extremely distressing when I tried to get help for my son. The form displayed above reception telling you how to raise issues refers to staff member who no longer works at surgery. Surgery telephoned me asking me to attend for appointment because the doctor wanted to see me.( I assumed this was to follow up results of recent blood test). But in fact the appointment was for my son. They are quick to hide behind confidentiality but in this case did not check my identity.
The Derby,"Always accessible, helpful and thorough.",6/14/2021,5,received a call back from the GP twice who was very patient and helpful.
The Derby,"Always excellent service from all doctors, nu",12/8/2020,5,Always ready to help either on the phone or in person.
The Derby,Always helpful,12/13/2021,5,Never any problems
The Derby,Anytime you're in a crisis they won't help you,12/8/2021,1,The staff here are great until it comes to mental health. Anytime you're in a crisis they won't help you. Been waiting over 6 months for support from the gp and still waiting. The staff don't listen to you and judge you horrifically. They don't care at all about anyone with mental health issues.
The Derby,"Appalling ""service"", impossible to contact.",11/10/2021,1,"Calling the surgery is the first trial:  An interminable, pointless announcement, then on being invited to choose an option, you are added to a ""queue"" that appears to use random numbers - ""You are number 8 in the call queue"" can suddenly become ""You are number seventeen in the call queue""!  The phone lines frequently cut off at random, forcing the patient to call innumerable times, and waste a huge amount of money on phone calls before - finally - getting through to an extremely rude and unhelpful receptionist, who seems to believe they are a Doctor.....

Attending the surgery is a dispiriting and frustrating experience - the automated ""sign-in"" screen seldom works, and Covid 19 means that they have about five seats in the Waiting Room. The ""Doctors"" seem to rely on ""Doctor Google"" to make their clinical assessments and decisions - they appear to have little interest in or understanding of their patient's condition. Patients appear to be an inconvenience.  Patients are never seen by the same Doctor twice - there's never any continuity of care.

The repeat prescription system is unreliable, and access to it is flaky.  Sometimes it fails to recognise your perfectly valid credentials. If I was able to change to a different practice, I would, but there's no availability elsewhere at present."
The Derby,Appointment with GP difficult to get,6/13/2016,4,I called for an appointment but was told that none were available with the GP. I was offered one with the nurse and was told to come back in a week if I was no better. That Saturday I had to call 111 as I deteriorated. They told me to go to A&E.
The Derby,Appointments for children not a problem,6/13/2016,5,Getting an appointment for the children is never a problem but for adults it is much more difficult.
The Derby,Ask my GP service is not available,4/24/2023,3,"Ask my GP is a good service but it is not available, I cannot understand why? when I phone I have to wait way too long, it is particulary frustrating when you work. If they have an online service for patients its frustrating that they dont have it available."
The Derby,Bad Service,8/8/2022,1,"While standing in pinewood reception this morning was told to go home and make a phone call to the surgery or use Ask My GP to make an appointment for annual review. Went home and phoned, answer message says taking urgent calls only. Tried Ask My GP Website  which  says UNAVAILABLE FOR ONLINE REQUESTS! Ridiculous!"
The Derby,Brilliant service helpful and quick response,7/20/2021,5,"Had a nasty insect bite,uploaded photo and my symptoms 2 hours later prescription with antibiotics given brilliant service"
The Derby,Cannot fault the service,6/1/2020,5,Cannot fault the service.  When I needed urgent help about a week ago there were no appointments here but there was at Pinewood.  It is a bit of a trek but I did need to see someone and was able to get there
The Derby,Cannot fault them.,4/10/2021,5,Everyone has been incredibly supportive to my husband and I through a number of medical issues. We are made to feel important to them and we are treated with a great deal of respect.
The Derby,Can't find better,9/15/2021,5,Been with surgery since 1970. Wouldn't change
The Derby,CONFUSED,12/2/2016,2,"Gentleman was registered at Derby Road surgery.  He received a letter saying he needed to register somewhere else please.  He was confused,  Otley surgery sent him a letter, he chose it and it is a very good surgery"
The Derby,Covid booster appointment,12/18/2021,1,Not sticking to booked appointments
The Derby,Desperate for an appointment,10/10/2020,1,My job doesn't allow me time to sit on the phone in a queue for over 30 minutes each morning in the hope that I get an appointment and when I do get through I'm told I can't book an appointment to fit in with my job.  Is this the thanks we get as key workers.
The Derby,diabetes check,8/17/2021,4,"A year on I am having my 'annual diabetes' check. Initially I rang and spoke to someone, and an appointment was made the next day.
I did however, have to go Landseer road for bloods and not at the surgery, which was ok, but they could not do it in one go."
The Derby,Efficient appointment at surgery.,9/11/2020,5,I got a letter telling me I needed to make an appointment for a smear test. I was able to make the appointment easily and quickly to attend the surgery for it. I felt comfortable visiting the surgery to attend and the nurse was kind and efficient.
The Derby,excellent,9/14/2017,5,I am very happy with my surgery
The Derby,Extremely helpful and good at giving info,9/11/2021,4,"I am hard of hearing so it takes me longer to understand, staff take great pains to ensure i have heard and do not mind repeating themselves."
The Derby,Extremely helpful Receptionist,3/15/2022,5,"I’m carer for my 95yr old dad who is very hard of hearing.  The lovely lady gave me all the information I need to use “contact my gp” online.  Stress free, very easy option to use"
The Derby,Fair,6/21/2016,3,They don't understand all the services available to them & you are then referred to the wrong ones . Getting an appointment is not a problem though.
The Derby,Fantastic despite these difficult COVID times,12/1/2021,5,I have had help and support in the diagnosis of a completely new problem for me and have been successfully referred to a specialist.
The Derby,Flu jab online booking,8/18/2021,2,Received a tx saying book Flu jab online but no obvious way of booking flu jab online. Am I missing something?
The Derby,Flu vaccine only available in pinewood,7/9/2020,5,"Because the flu clinic is the other side of Ipswich I will have to travel twice the distance, this means double the taxi fare. Always had the injection in Derby Rd practice in years gone  by, why not this year."
The Derby,friendly  and caring,1/14/2021,5,friendly and caring staff. They were amazing with my anxiety
The Derby,Friendly professional service,11/10/2021,5,"I have always found the surgery staff to be very efficient and good at their job, having many health issues they have always talked through a care plan with me and left me feeling positive. The only downside is not being able to book online appointments, but aside from that great service."
The Derby,Gone downhill.,4/14/2022,1,Online system is awful. Dr will close the request online without you being able to ask following questions. They have messed up my prescription several times because of this. Very impersonal and online system set up to suit the surgery not what's best for the patients. Can't speak to a a GP on the phone at all now let alone see one.
The Derby,Good,4/26/2021,4,A vast majority of the staff at Pinewood surgery are both professional and compassionate.
The Derby,Good Availability,8/12/2017,5,Can always get appointments when I need it but I do not use the surgery very often.
The Derby,Good considering the volume of patients,8/19/2022,5,"When you telephone you have to listen to the recorded messages that are repeated and talk about the online system. I do understand that you have to get the message across but it does give the impression of putting you off calling and giving up on the service if you are not PC literate. If I do call I will not normally call in the morning. I hear horror stories of people who have to book at other surgery’s and pinewood sounds much better. The online system is good in that you do get an answer/ call back.  I’ve always had a friendly, 
professional sometimes humorous experience when talking to the operators who always are able to help."
The Derby,Good listener,8/12/2017,4,I find it ok to get an appointment and I only have to wait 5 or 10 minutes in the surgery before I'm seen. I like my doctor as they are a good listener. It does hurt when I have a blood test. I'm happy with my doctors.
The Derby,Great admin staff and some good doctors,2/2/2021,4,I had been suffering from burning sensations for some time. My blood results were coming up as all fine. It was until 2 weeks ago I had an appointment with one of the male doctors at Pinewood surgery. He was very patient and listened to my concerns. He then had a look at my blood results and said my vitamin D level was low and could be the reason why I have these burning sensations.  He suggested I buy some strong Vit D supplements. I did buy them and I haven't experienced those burning sensations again. I am very grateful for such doctors who have time to look very well into things and not think that their patients are anxious..
The Derby,Great experience at Derby Road,8/13/2020,5,Listened to and treated with care and compassion by all members of practice staff that I dealt with today. Many thanks.
The Derby,Had emergency appointment this afternoon,9/21/2021,5,Was feeling very poorly due to suspect ear infection as already deaf in one ear had to get my daughter to phone for a emergency appointment which was done brilliantly. So I would like to thank the Dr for being so understanding and polite and gentle big thank you.
The Derby,"Helpful, patient and polite receptionist.",3/26/2022,3,"Unfortunately, despite her best efforts she was unable to find any records of recent contacts made by Derby Road Practice.  This matched my own search on ""Systmonline.""    Two appointments were cancelled by telephone, in February, because of equipment failure which appears not to have been repaired."
The Derby,I booked language Line but didn't get,11/16/2016,1,"I arrived in the Country a few months ago with no English. To book a GP appointment I ask Suffolk Refugee Support (SRS) to do it for me. They do and requested for Language Line. Usually I get Language Line, but today the doctor said the phone line was not working and so I had to phone someone who spoke my language to interpret."
The Derby,I have to wait a long time,6/10/2015,3,I have to wait a long time before I can see a doctor and it's difficult to see preferred gp.
The Derby,I love my doctors  surgery,5/26/2022,5,"Staff always so polite and helpful go beyond their normal duties, my doctor so kind and understanding since having covid has been just amazing  to help me get my life back on track."
The Derby,I try not to use Language Line,11/16/2016,4,"I never make emergency appointments. I always walk to the surgery and book an appointment for a week later. I try and use my English. My mother uses Language Line, but does not understand the Arabic interpreters due to her dialect of Arabic. The nurses & doctors are good."
The Derby,Impossible to get to see a Doctor,11/5/2022,1,"""Phone at 8.30"" - ""You're number 81 in the queue....  You're number 17 in the queue...."" Call drops because they have a dodgy telephone system.   Call back....
""You're number 43 in the queue....""   Rinse and repeat.....
Absolutely hopeless.
If - eventually - you get through to a receptionist, you're grilled - by someone without the slightest medical training - as to why you have the temerity to want an appointment with an actual Doctor.....
They then make EVERY excuse possible to deny you an appointment."
The Derby,impossible to use electronic forms,5/8/2021,1,my relative has complex problems with a physical health problem which was having a severe impact on mental health.  The mental health team has supported but it has been impossible to navigate through the complex forms process for people who have severe mental health difficulties and they were assisted to do this by surgery staff who did not appear to communicate with each other.  The form does not allow you to even complete the form if there is an impact on suicidal thoughts and the reception staff direct to the form so how can we get help for the problem.
The Derby,it downloads the relevant questionnaire,10/8/2021,1,it downloads the relevant questionnaire/s as a PDF document so I am unable to fill them in as I cannot add my answers to the digital document as it is supposed to be printed out and as I do not have access to a printer it is pointless me downloading it.
The Derby,Kind and friendly staff,2/20/2021,5,"The receptionist was very friendly and helpful on the phone.
I got a gp telephone appointment the next morning on a Saturday,  she was very understanding and very kind. 
Very happy with the service I received"
The Derby,Lovely staff and good overall experience,10/15/2020,4,"Great admin staff  and overall very happy however my only complaint is waiting times for appointments and the fact they they bring in staff  constantly from elsewhere, I have never even met my regular GP."
The Derby,"No appointment times, just a date",10/22/2021,1,"On several occasions recently I have needed to discuss a medical issue for myself or my teenage son. I understand that face-to-face appointments are not necessarily an option at the moment, but if a telephone consultation is appropriate then it still needs and actual appointment time. On recent occasions all I have received is a day on which somebody will call. This doesn't give adequate consideration for patient needs, including privacy concerns - it simply isn't acceptable to sit waiting all day for a call for myself or my son, but the alternative is to have to take a private medical call either in a public place, at work, or with people who you may not want to discuss such issues in front of, as there is no option to schedule the days plans around a known call time. When calling on behalf of a child it is equally unacceptable to have to cancel all their plans for the day, just to make sure that they are available for the call 'at some point'. Frankly it is disrespectful of both patient's time and need for privacy in medical matters. Telephone appointments need a specific time slot just the same as face-to-face appointments do."
The Derby,no care given,11/8/2022,1,"Told to see a pharmasist, no help, told to go online, I have system care login but when I try GP online I put my email in, I haven't got a password, I request a password by pressing forgotten and I hear nothing, I have been ill for months and it has been 3 years since I had a Hypertention check up, I will just die because we have to diagnose ourselves anyway."
The Derby,Not good at responding to request to see GP,8/10/2021,1,"Feet and ankles swelling, was asked to send photographs which I did 6 weeks ago and still have not had a response."
The Derby,Not seeing babies unless they have had pcr,9/10/2021,2,I understand pcr tests are required for those showing symptoms but babies…..is unnecessary and delaying babies who poorly being seen by a medical professional. All other parents I have spoken to do not have to have their babies pcr tested for be seen by their GP. The inconsistent approach is unfair and unclear.
The Derby,Online booking not fit for purpose,7/26/2020,4,Up until about 3 years ago you could book appointments online up to about a month ahead. Since then the service has gone to pot and it is very rare to be able to book an online appointment. One doesn't expect to be able to do it during the Covid pandemic but it would be a good idea to reinstate it at the earliest opportunity. I assume it has stopped due to lack of staff.
The Derby,Overall a good service,12/20/2018,4,"Sometimes it can take a while to get an appointment, but overall the service is good."
The Derby,Pinewood - Not taken seriously,3/8/2020,2,"Never see the same Dr. Every time I go into the practise, I feel like I have to start from the beginning. Suffering with IBS/stomach complaints, that are making my life a living hell.

But after a string of negative tests, I have received no further contact. When I chased the tests, I was told by reception that everything is fine.

Everything is NOT fine, my life is a misery because of this condition. But it appears that this doesn’t matter.

Fobbed off once again."
The Derby,Pinewood never see the same doctor,7/8/2020,2,Pinewood whenever a call is made for an appointment NO MATTER WHAT TIME there is never an appointment with a Doctor You really want to see. then you have to call back when the new calendar is opened. We are actively looking for a different Surgery
The Derby,Prompt and polite service,12/2/2018,5,"The Health Navigator provided a prompt, polite and effective service, directing me to Riverside Clinic and then arranging an appointment for me."
The Derby,Receptionist now a doctor!,10/14/2021,2,I wanted to speak to a GP and described intense two day long headache that was NOT a migraine like I’ve had before. Was told by receptionist she would send me a leaflet about migraines!! Eventually got sent the online link and have waited all day but no call back whilst sitting here in agony. I’ve had normal painkillers two days straight with no effect
The Derby,Receptionist rude,12/17/2021,1,"No one will see me for an appointment, Doctor not fulfilling duty."
The Derby,Relaxed atmosphere,1/9/2017,5,I like this practice. The staff are all good and there is a relaxed atmosphere
The Derby,Sadly gone downhill,6/21/2022,2,"This used to be the best surgery to my knowledge in Ipswich, but seems to have gone the way of many others meaning that important but non life threatening issues no longer stand a chance of being resolved. Didn't get a chance to see anyone. not even a phone call."
The Derby,Sent to pinewood,8/13/2020,3,I live 10 mins away from derby road and every appointment I've had for me and my child has been sent to pinewood which is too far away I tell them that I dont have the funds to make the trip and stuff I get told they would make a note but obviously dont and now I have to go back up there for a flu jab they do not care no one said why I keep getting put up the other surgery the only reason I switched as it was closer to me if it keeps happening I will find a new surgery where I know I am properly listen too
The Derby,Staff lovely and kind,6/1/2020,5,Service excellent.  Here to support family member and the staff are always lovely and kind with him
The Derby,Superb care,2/16/2021,5,Even with the challenges of Covid-19 Derby Road Practice has been superb in their care and diligence regarding my 92 year old father. They are all stars !!
The Derby,Supportive and kind Doctors and staff.,1/3/2021,5,"l am a patient of the pinewood surgery. l cannot praise Dr Owen and Dr Emily enough.
They are very reassuring during these difficult covid times..  The pinewood receptions are also kind and supportive."
The Derby,System works well,6/10/2015,4,The system works well for me.
The Derby,"They are always friendly,caring and helpful.",7/1/2020,5,No particular recent experience but Pinewood has been my GP surgery for 20 years and I have always been happy with the service..
The Derby,Too much reliance on the online technology.,8/24/2021,3,"I have been on the records at Derby Road for a number of years. The surgery and staff are generally friendly and decidated to helping the patients. 

What I have found, especially since Covid hit, is the over reliance on the use of messages on the telephone. On more than one occasion I have reached almost 5 minutes of listening to messages about what the surgery won't / don't and can't help with before getting to the options of the automated services. This is simply poor and unnecessary.

Also, now everything seems directed toward the online service. It is taking away the human side of the patient relationship and while failing to recognise that older people are going to struggle with this service as they simply don't understand or don't like computers. 

It has been difficult, for a while, to get an appointment especially for non urgent but concerning health related matters. You have to phone on the day to get an appointment that same day but in the past I have tried to phone for a future appointment which was not possible.

My father struggles with his surgery as part of this practice group due to the lack of face to face customer service, for which he relies due to issues with using modern technology and online services. He often comments that he feels the practise does not want to see patients, therefore he is slower in getting seen."
The Derby,Took mum for flu jab. Super-efficient!,9/20/2021,5,Really well-organised. I live away and was texted with parking information and time. Very easy to bring mum and support her as she is nervous due to other medical conditions.
The Derby,Top class service from the Practice,7/7/2020,5,"I can honestly say that I have had fantastic service from Derby Road Practice. I have been with several GP practices over the years and always struggled to get appointments. Here the staff really take an interest in their patients. I've always managed to get appointments when I've needed one. Currently, during the COVID crisis they have adapted really well to new working practices. As one of the most vulnerable and shielding, I have had welfare calls and plenty of contact and support during a current and ongoing health issue. I would especially like to praise Nurses (names removed) and Dr (name removed). Thank you."
The Derby,Unable to get flu vaccination.,12/18/2020,1,"8/9/20 Received text that I would be offered a flu jab THIS year. Please wait for contact.

24/11/20. Received text asking to phone to confirm that I wished to have jab. Did so as I'd had flu previous Xmas. Told I was the first caller and would therefore be first on list. Called 3/12/20 as heard nothing, told I would get a call/text. 17/12/20 Called yet again, yes, doing vaccinations but I wasn't on the list. Why not? I shouldn't have been told I was first on the list. Irrelevant. Don't care if I was first or last, I should have been in the first batch of vaccinations. Asked that in reality, I wasn't going to get one THIS year was I . No I wasn't. Missed a call later from the surgery,  so asked to call  back which I did. Told that they could"" fit me in"" at a surgery elsewhere in the town on Xmas Eve. I live 3 mins walk from Derby Road Practice. And I'm not around Xmas Eve, so no vaccination this year."
The Derby,"Understaffed, that is obvious",11/23/2017,3,"At my last appointment with my child things just looked 'overrun' with people waiting ages. I saw a locum who told me there was only 1 other GP in that day, and he was rushed in first thing to help out. I know it is not their fault but something needs to be done."
The Derby,Very poor communication & management,9/25/2019,1,"I am a housebound patient registered with the Derby Road Surgery.  I have a number of serious concerns regarding the care offered by this practice.  The surgery are very reluctant to make house-calls and continually pressure me in to attending the surgery and their appointment process makes life even more difficult as I am unable to make appointments days ahead as I am unsure as to how I will be physically.  Staff (one particular receptionist in particular) are often rude and defensive, I have had the telephone put down on me when attempting to correct an error in my prescriptions when they failed to deliver OraMorph.  Eventually having to speak directly to the senior partner who found that they indeed had made a mistake.  I am now in a position where any contact with the surgery causes me intense worry & has made my condition far worse as I now don't feel able to or have the confidence to form any sort of relationship with health professionals.  When I complained and refused to accept wrong advice, I was labelled as a 'difficult/abusive' patient, even though I remained calm & polite throughout my dealings - this I found most disheartening and has meant that they have more or less left me dealing with my conditions without any support whatsoever."
The Derby,Well happy,2/19/2016,4,Well happy. Only down side is getting an appointment which is a nightmare as I work in Newmarket. But lovely people at the surgery and i don't usually have to wait long.
The Derby,Where’s flu online booking?,8/20/2021,1,Got a text saying I could book flu vaccine online but the website and system online have no mention of it…
The Derby,Wonderful GPs,7/1/2016,5,"I have always had a wonderful experience with this practice.  I am aware that it will take two weeks to see a GP for a regular appointment but I am happy to wait to see my GP who is patient, understanding and compassionate.  She listens and takes my symptoms seriously and is very reassuring.  Excellent GP"
The Norwich,2 star,6/18/2015,2,2 star
The Norwich,Absolutly disgusting surgery,10/19/2020,1,"Never known a surgery like it. I recently put in a repeat prescription for my son and half the stuff was missed off. You go onto the repeat prescription on the website and it states put your prescription in good time, which we did, only to not get everything we required. Now our infant son has to wait until the surgery can pull their finger out and get it sorted."
The Norwich,Booking appointments easier with online service,3/28/2017,4,Appointments used to be difficult to book when I had to use the telephone-it is much better now I have registered to be able to book online
The Norwich,Brilliant Nurse sits & listens to you,7/1/2015,5,"Doctors at Norwich Rd are all good too. Nurse practitioners are brilliant, always have time for you, doesn't mind being late for others so you're not rushed. I always try to see the nurse and will delay appointments to do so."
The Norwich,Care excellent,8/15/2016,5,Speaking on behalf of my late husband.  The care he was given was excellent.  The doctors were always very caring and efficient
The Norwich,Care was excellent,5/28/2016,5,This is on behalf of my late husband who died in August 2015. The care he was given was excellent and the doctor involved was a real friend to us both.
The Norwich,Confident in doctors,12/14/2017,5,Confident in doctors at the surgery. Able to get appointments when needed. The new doctor I saw was very good. Blood tests are easy to get at the surgery.
The Norwich,Difficult to get appointments,5/28/2016,4,Very difficult to get appointments as per procedure
The Norwich,Difficult to get blood tests,9/11/2018,3,"Getting a blood test done at the surgery is very difficult, you are just told to go up to the Riverside clinic, where there is limited seating and its very busy."
The Norwich,Difficulty booking appointments,7/16/2015,4,Difficulty booking to see a certain doctor.
The Norwich,Difficulty organising a test,9/11/2018,3,I made the staff aware that for the special blood test I was having it would need booking through electronically to the hospital but when we arrived at the hospital it hadn't been done. This meant that we had to go back and forth to get it all sorted. It was very frustrating especially considering I made them aware there would be an issue.
The Norwich,Doctor and staff treat me with respect,12/16/2015,4,The doctor and staff treat me with respect as I am disabled and also tell me to wait in warm for my taxi
The Norwich,Dont go there unless you have no other choice,9/26/2019,1,This surgery is poor!! You cannot get a routine appointment for weeks and if you need an on the day appointment you can be holding on for 40 minutes or more before you get to speak to an actual person.  By the time a receptionist does answer you are really stressed and angry.  They seem to take the brunt of a pretty poor service to patients which is not fair on them.  This practice should be banned in ALL surgeries everywhere.  When you are not well you need to speak to a person not listen to a bloody machine.  I feel sure some elderly patients just hang up rather than go through this rigmarole when they may need emergency medical assistance.  And I would not be surprised to learn that people actually die because of this unacceptable practice.  This surgery is not alone in doing this and it is simply not acceptable.  It is like the third world!!
The Norwich,E-consult awful,8/21/2020,1,I'm very technical and capable yet E-consult is a nightmare - keeps telling me to ring 999 or 111 when all I need is a medication review.
The Norwich,Excellent care by GPs,10/10/2018,4,"We went to see the GP about my daughters eye.   She's 9.   The GP took more time than ever talking to her, not me about what was wrong.   This was great and she felt that she was really looked after.   I've always found the care at this surgery to be good to great.   We've been with them for over 20 years.  Receptionists are also actually really friendly and helpful in my experience."
The Norwich,Excellent treatment,9/23/2022,5,I've unfortunately had a lot of health problems in the last few years and have seen several doctors and nurses there.  I've ALWAYS had excellent treatment by staff and all have been very helpful. Can't thank them enough.
The Norwich,fair,6/21/2016,3,"Receptionist not very welcoming, not nice attitude.  Me and my husband who are in our 80s  have to wait for 3 - 4 weeks to see our own doctor.  We thought we should not at our age.  Not happy, have told them in the waiting room"
The Norwich,fair,6/21/2016,3,Unable to get appointment same day
The Norwich,fair,6/21/2016,3,Not enough doctors.  Nurses are OK but they are not doctors
The Norwich,Fair,6/21/2016,3,Difficult to get an appointment with specific doctor
The Norwich,Fair but hard to get appointment and a member of staff is rude,9/14/2017,3,I have had to wait 2 weeks for my baby to be seen.  One member of the reception staff is quite rude
The Norwich,"Fair but issues with new staff, prescriptions and records",12/20/2016,3,Teething problems with new staff have occurred which meant that we had wasted visits.  Recently they changed prescription wait times to 72 hours without warning.  Patient fies aren't up to date with information.  When in the surgery the phones can ring and ring but the staff don't always answer even though they don't look like they are doing anything.
The Norwich,Fair but making 'phone appointments is hard,9/14/2017,3,Getting seen on time is much better than it used to be.  It is very difficult to get through on the phone to make an appointment
The Norwich,Fair but some docs don't listen & long waiting times,9/14/2017,3,"Some doctors do't listen;  they write a prescription while I am still talking..I would prefer to see my named doctor - this rarely happens.  As I get older they don't seem to want to know.  I have waited for over an hour, but usually it is wirhin 20 minutes"
The Norwich,Flu jab,5/1/2021,5,"Received text saying eligible, Telephoned surgery and was given appointment for following week, Appointment was on time, quick, efficient and safely administered. Thank you Norwich Road."
The Norwich,Flu-jab,12/16/2020,5,I was contacted by the surgery by text informing me of my eligibility for a flu-jab. I phoned to book my place - the flu clinic was in the scout hut in Chesterfield drive. My wife and I arrived at the scheduled time and we were back out again in minutes - great service Much appreciated.
The Norwich,Generally a good surgery,6/6/2016,5,"Generally it's a good surgery but staff attitude on my last visit was not good. The reception has a sign up to say be polite to staff but this is not always reciprocated. I asked for an appointment, was told none were available. I explained why I needed an appointment and was told that as I'd had it a week it couldn't be that bad. I was then, however, given an appointment at 10.00am."
The Norwich,Get to see the same doctor,3/15/2016,5,"ES 
I generally see the same doctor all the  time unless its more urgent. She has been very good."
The Norwich,Getting an appointment is ok,3/28/2017,4,I have no major issues here-getting an appointment is ok
The Norwich,good,7/3/2019,4,Getting an appointment by phone is very difficult.  The last 3 times I've tried to see a doctor I've had to see a nurse practitioner
The Norwich,good,7/3/2019,4,"Can't get advance appointments, only on the day"
The Norwich,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Depending on the doctor, it can feel like your concerns are not being listened to.  Getting an apt with your preferred doctor can be difficult"
The Norwich,good,7/3/2019,4,Its a good surgery. Like many others though they are struggling to recruit doctors
The Norwich,good,7/3/2019,4,"Receptionists can be rude and when I asked for an appointment I was told there wasn't one, but it was the way it was said"
The Norwich,Good -  can usually get appointments.,1/8/2017,4,This was a nurse's appointment  - some waiting time but not a problem because I get extra time when needed.  Good service at GP appointments too.  Booking an appointment can be tricky as you have to ring in at 8 am (everyone else is ringing at this time) but I usually get an appointment when I need one.
The Norwich,Good but long waiting times,9/14/2017,4,My appointment was for 10 minutes ago and I'm still waiting.  I wasn't told they were running late.  They don't explain unless you ask
The Norwich,Good but severe lack of appointments,9/14/2017,4,Lack of appointments.  Rang 18 times  and no appointments available when I got through.  I got a 30 minute appointment which is good.  Been a patient since I was born. Need more staff.  Appointment system could be improved
The Norwich,Good doctors,3/28/2017,5,I have been here for years and I have never had any problems-they are good doctors
The Norwich,"Good experience, helpful",6/8/2016,5,Dr was very good and understanding of my problem.
The Norwich,Good recent care,12/13/2017,4,"You never know who you will see now, you see multiple doctors so you can lose some of the consistency. The care provided by both the nurse and doctor I've seen recently have been good."
The Norwich,Great GP's but issue with staff,10/15/2015,4,GPs are outstanding in the surgery. Unfortunately one member of staff has a bad attitude towards patients which is spoiling the reputation of what is a good practice.
The Norwich,Have to ring at 8.00 to get an appointment is problematic,3/28/2017,3,Nurses are better than doctors at explaining medication/treatment. I also have to ring at 8.00 and it can take some time to get through.
The Norwich,Helpful doctors / nasty reception staff,1/31/2019,1,"For someone with a mental health condition, I have great anxiety when having to deal with the reception in the morning. Either on the phone, 2 of them are very nasty, stating I can only have an on the day appointment if it is life threatening.,she has also said if I need an on the day urgent appointment I wouldn't be at work, extremely judgemental. I stay because of 3 medical staff who go over and above their role. It's sad as reception is destroying the surgery. They recently had new reception staff who are friendly but you never know when they are there. When you call at 8am you will always get the ones who judge if your issue is urgent enough. They are not trained medically are they? I do hope this feedback is taken seriously but I doubt it. I just want to be treated with respect just as I respect them, I understand they must be busy but to talk at you sternly is not acceptable."
The Norwich,Helpful staff and doctors,12/18/2020,4,Hoping the planned merger will improve and streamline wait times (appreciative of the current Covid situation). The only negative about the merger would be the possibility of more anonimity and a less 'personal' service.
The Norwich,Its too long to wait on phone,6/27/2023,3,Having to wait too long on the phone to get through is not a good service. at times I have had to wait up to 45 mins. I dont understand how I can be number 48 in the queue when they have only just turned the phones on.
The Norwich,Lovely Nurse,2/24/2020,4,It is a shame that many can be so negative about the NHS. The nurse was ever so helpful and understanding. Thank you
The Norwich,Lovely receptionists & doctors have time,5/28/2021,5,Very welcome staff and always ready to help
The Norwich,Making an appointment,6/9/2021,2,"Phoned for a routine blood test appointment this morning at approx 11.30am, 21st in queue.  Again at 12 noon now 19th. No indication of approx how long you will be waiting, or how many receptionists were taking calls.  Why does System online not allow digital bookings for blood tests?"
The Norwich,Mixed,6/10/2015,3,"I wear hearing aids. Doctors call for patients from waiting room to go into their consulting rooms and speak too quietly, so I don't hear. Then they end up shouting. It would be better if they had an electronic board to use for names to go on when doctors are ready for you. They are poor for hearing impairment. They think you're stupid because you don't hear. There is a lack of recognition of hearing impairment with health services generally.

I don't like the practice of 'fobbing' people off with seeing Practice Nurse rather than the GP. Practice Nurses are fine, but not the GP and I know when I need to see a GP rather than a Practice Nurse. One time I went to the Nurse who asked me how much coffee I drank and told me, as I drank 5 cups a day, I should drink decaf. When I asked why, she didn't know! She just said she'd been told to say that.

1 GP (a locum) is brilliant. Waiting times to get an appointment with a GP slightly better than getting an appointment to see a nurse."
The Norwich,More continuity of care needed,6/10/2015,2,"I would like more continuity of care, seeing the same doctor. When you have an ongoing problem you don't want to keep explaining your history to different doctors all the time. Treatment explanation - they don't always listen to me so have not awarded any stars. Quality of care a bit mixed."
The Norwich,no  rota available for a month ahead,4/30/2016,3,"When a doctor suggests seeing you in a month, there is no rota available and it is suggested you ring back in 2 weeks by which time there are no appointments.  No contihuity of doctors to review your problem."
The Norwich,no communication between patients and,7/1/2021,1,"extremely long queues on the phone, even getting cut off during conversations,  rude reception staff. practice manager refuses to speak to patients.  low staff morale.  no regular GPs, actually rarely see a gp. treatments and tests not explained. treated more like meat than humans. a animals get treated better."
The Norwich,Not able to produce the service,3/11/2015,1,"Very poor, not able to provide service as member of staff on holiday, no one else able to do it.  At surgery for half an hour awaiting a satisfactory outcome.  Referred to Allied - superb service."
The Norwich,Not enough doctors,2/5/2016,3,There aren't enough doctors. The nurses are ok but they aren't doctors
The Norwich,Not much delay for an 'on the day' appt.,3/28/2017,4,Drs give everyone time during the appointments so there sometimes there is a slight delay in the waiting room. There isn't much delay in getting an 'on the day' appointment but others can take 3-4 days for specific clinicians.
The Norwich,Often can't get an appointment,3/28/2017,3,You often can't get an appointment on the day and sometimes it takes 2-3 weeks
The Norwich,Outstanding,3/30/2016,5,Even when I go in to make an appointment the receptionists ask how we are. When I was struggling the GP prescribed me meds and even gave me a hug! Outstanding.
The Norwich,Overall good,5/28/2016,4,Overal Norwich Rd. Surgery has a very good appointment system
The Norwich,Overall I'm pretty satisfied,3/28/2017,4,Overall I'm pretty satisfied. there are no real issues and I can usually get an appointment on the day
The Norwich,Overall ok but I had a bad experience,9/26/2018,4,Overall the surgery is ok. I have asthma and when I had a bad chest I called for an appointment-receptionist said two weeks. The next day I was worse and called again and I was told to go to hospital! I don't think the receptionist knew about asthma.
The Norwich,Phone call,6/10/2020,1,"I was told by a receptionist that the doctors a very busy, how are they busy when they are restricting the number of patients that they see. ???"
The Norwich,poor,1/19/2016,1,"no appointment despite phoning repeatedly at 8 am,
My two daughters (1.5 and 2.5 yrs) have bad coughs and I phoned at 8 am today for a GP appointment but I couldn't get through despite caling many times from 8 am until 8,12 am.  When I got through at 8,12 am they said they are full; call back after 12 noon and they will make apt, for Riverside after 6 pm but this too late for my children.  This has happened twice before."
The Norwich,Poor - no result from attending.,1/8/2017,1,Because I didn't get any result from going there.
The Norwich,Poor customer service from reception.,3/30/2021,2,"The booking staff are not at all helpful or willing to help you politely. If a booking has been cancelled or moved to another day by them, they did not notify us of any changes. Its happened to us more than three times ! There are other things we're not happy about so we are registering at another surgery. Have been at Norwich Rd for many years, but over time it's gradually got worst due to the bad staff (not the doctors as majority of the doctors are good)."
The Norwich,Poor on one occasion but usually no problem,12/14/2016,1,"I requested a repeat prescription from pharmacy (Rainbow Norwich Road) last Friday and was told it would be ready for collection on Wed 19 October.  On Monday 17 October i received a copy letter from the hospital informing me that my medication dose needed rerating,  I took the copy letter to the GP surgery.  The receptionist copied the letter and attached a repeat prescription letter expaining that I needed an increase to the copy.  She said it would ready in the pharmacy by Wednesday.  It was not ready on Wednesday or Thursday.  The pharmacy have been excellent in chasing up the prescription with the doctor, who had had 4  days to get the prescription issued"
The Norwich,Poor reception staff,9/21/2017,2,Clinicians are fine but reception staff are not so good
The Norwich,Poor response from reception staff when following instructions given by surgery,1/11/2020,1,My husband was phoned by the surgery and told to order a blood test at landseer rd. followed by an appointment with surgery nurse for a heart check. He did this and tried to phone the surgery .He waited until after 12 as specified. He was on the phone queueing for over 25 minutes only to be told he couldn’t make an appointment. Eventually the receptionist explained that he needed a 20 minute appointment and they only had 10 minutes. After repeating several times “what should I do.” He was informed that it wasn’t important !!!! Maybe not to her but important to him who has been sheltering and worrying. His wellness appointment has also been cancelled so I am saying...this was not an appropriate response.
The Norwich,"Poor, unable to get appt on day",4/27/2015,2,"different dr, seem to be locums, text apt back not me, had an apt when surgery was closed"
The Norwich,"Prescription wrong or delayed, long phone wait",10/22/2020,2,Telephone waiting often half an hour. Constantly having to chase up prescriptions for my Mum. Whenever there is a medication change it is nearly always dealt with incorrectly. Often fobbed off by reception. Very stressful dealing with this organisation.
The Norwich,Pretty good all round,3/28/2017,5,I've been a patient here for some years and I would say I have found them to be pretty good all round
The Norwich,Pretty much always a wait,3/28/2017,4,They are pretty good but there is pretty much always a wait after my appointment time. Provided I can call at 8.00 I can usually get an appointment ok
The Norwich,Reception staff are awful. Gp is awesome,1/31/2019,1,"Several occasions I have had to call on behalf of my mother as whenever she calls at 8am, she is told immediately there are no other day appointments. This happened 3 days in a row. Eventually, I called on her behalf and stated that she needed to be seen that day (she had a suspected water infection that needed antibiotics) I was spoken to in a very rude and condescending manner. When I explained that it was urgent, the receptionist (who is known to both myself and my mother) stated that the urgent appointments are only for patients who are suffering from heart attacks or strokes! She then asked me ""is your mother having a heart attack or stroke?"" to which I replied if that was the case I would be taking her to a&e NOT the doctors surgery! This isn't the first time this known receptionist has asked this question. Eventually, I called in the afternoon and got an appointment. It shouldn't be like that. MANAGEMENT:why are you not listening to your patients feedback? My mother needed antibiotics and we were told it was very serious getting an infection like that at her age. I would hate to think what would happen to people that do not have anyone supporting them. There needs to be clarification on what is ""urgent"" and to stop making patients feel belittled"
The Norwich,Receptionist thinks she’s in charge,7/10/2020,1,"Second time running they have messed up my wife’s prescription 
Tried sorting out and receptionist refused to let my wife speak to doctor to sort this out and said that she will have to have what is on there even though it’s been changed without my wife’s consent"
The Norwich,Rude reception staff,9/22/2020,1,"There is one reception staff who is very rude, abrupt and thinks she runs the place, the other reception staff are lovely, but I will put the phone down if I get the rude one. It would be nice if you didn't have yo go through all your history everytime you see someone, if they read your notes before hand. I have had to explain why I can't take certain meds!!!"
The Norwich,Rude reception staff. Cancelled my pescripton,7/10/2020,1,"Went to pick up my pescripton from the chemist. Had not got what I needed, so called doctors and he doctors changed it from 3 months to 1 month. Went-called to sort out nobody wanted to help. Told me that I could get the first pescripton from the chemist and try some where else. So I do this, and land up find out that the doctors in between me collecting the pescripton from the chemist to try somewhere else, have cancelled the pescripton. Call back and just got told cannot do anything. Knowing that I had no meds for the weekend. Went to Deben road surgery, reception person could not of been more polite and helpful. Dr was still there, did me a hand written pescripton to take to Asda to get my 3 months of tablets. So will be calling to move to here. Have been with Norwich road since I was born. Over 50 yrs. They are really going down hill."
The Norwich,Some doctors don't really care,9/14/2017,4,Looked at and then I feel that I am not really listened to.  It is as if some of the doctors don't really care.
The Norwich,Staff Dismissive.,6/8/2016,4,Took my two young children to see a nurse as they had temperatures and coughing. Staff were rude and dismissive and after listening to their chests gave me a scrap of paper with 'Calpol' on it and told me to go to the pharmacy. felt that i wasn't given any attention.
The Norwich,Take a long time to answer queries,5/16/2019,3,Waiting for answers on the telephone is very bad and quite a long while.
The Norwich,The worst doctors I have ever been with,9/9/2020,1,"Dreadful, no care"
The Norwich,Time wasted on hold and incorrect info!,3/12/2020,1,"Two sessions of 45 mins on hold, as I was cut off when finally at the front. Hold music is liable to cause stress and irritation. Information given regarding yearly diabetes review turns out to be incorrect!!"
The Norwich,To long a wait to see GP,7/10/2015,1,"I went to GP - say i need appmt for test had to wait 25 days for an apptmt - why?
Dr did get interpreter for my apptmt which was good as I have only been in England for 1yr (from Kurdistan)"
The Norwich,too many recorded messages,12/4/2021,4,"IMO the recorded messages when you call are too long and too many, often repeating information.  Not good for patients with hearing loss as some are clear, others not.  Does anyone from the practice ever listen to them?  Good service when eventually able to speak to a human!"
The Norwich,Variable.,6/8/2016,3,"In December 2015 I had a MRI which was the result of a referral in 9 2015. In January I went to my GP for them to tell me my results from the MRI scan. The GP could not explain the result well to me and did not refer me back to the hospital. I was not happy so made another appointment with another GP at my surgery. This time was asked if I wanted language line. I said no as my English is good. With hindsight I should have yes. This GP helped me to understand what was wrong with me and referred me back to the hospital. When the hospital told me how long it would take to get an appointment and due to the pain I was in I went to the Suffolk Refugee Support for help. They contacted the health outreach team at St Helens Street. The next day the health outreach team, knowing my situation contacted the hospital and got me a cancellation appointment the following week."
The Norwich,Very busy,5/28/2016,5,The practice is very busy but they are always willing to facilitate
The Norwich,Very good,9/13/2022,4,Been at the surgery all my life see no need for merger
The Norwich,Waiting time on telephone is far too long.,7/15/2021,1,"It is extremely difficult to get through to the surgery on the telephone at any time of the day. There is no other way to contact the surgery eg-text, email, or even in person. My average waiting time on the phone is 1 hour and 10 mins. I appreciate the difficulties at the moment due to COVID (assumedly) but it is very frustrating and inconvenient. This forces people who are very ill to go to A&E instead which adds to the pressures experienced at A&E."
The Norwich,Worst GP Surgery,8/12/2020,1,"After moving to the area 10 years ago I have been with this surgery. Each and every time I have needed to visit I have had to wait nearly an hour to get through, appointments run well over an hour late and in fact don't even get seen of you have and end of day appointment and the staff want to go home. Manager will not deal with complaints."
The Peninsula,2nd day of calling,7/2/2020,4,"Called yesterday and told to give child Calpol.  Child got so much worse and so called again today and this time spoke to GP.  Diagnosis is a bit scary. Wish we had been seen or at least spoke to GP yesterday, just made me worry as its a child."
The Peninsula,A little inflexible,3/5/2022,4,It would have been very good but I feel the appointments system isn’t quite flexible enough and whilst very pleased to have the introduction of the repeat prescription service it is sometimes inconsistent
The Peninsula,Access with no transport,3/5/2022,3,Appointments take a long time to book and often I am sent to a different practice even though I do not have transport.
The Peninsula,Always helpful,3/5/2022,5,I have always found all staff helpful. I have had no issues getting an appointment when needed.
The Peninsula,Always....,3/5/2022,5,I have always found the GP’s and staff very helpful and friendly on the limited times l have used the surgery
The Peninsula,Amazing during illness of partner,1/11/2019,3,"These last couple of months the surgery have been amazing whilst my partner has been gravely unwell and passed away.
Usually however I have found it a difficult place to access. Trying to get past reception. But when you do, the clinical staff are very good."
The Peninsula,Appointment,4/29/2022,4,I am able to get an appointment at the Orford surgery mostly when needed.
The Peninsula,Appointments sometimes too far,3/5/2022,4,Mostly good but we get appointments with surgeries too far away when we live just round the corner.
The Peninsula,Booking system,3/5/2022,3,"GP when seen is Good. 
Website booking system/patient contact is, in my view, needing review."
The Peninsula,Brilliant with my children,10/26/2018,5,"Never had any problems here.  What I particularly like, is the way the staff are with my children.  Once the GP drew an ear on paper to explain things.  They really too their time to speak clearly and direct their attention to my child, which really helped my child and I really appreciated the obvious genuine care shown."
The Peninsula,Cannot talk highly enough,1/11/2019,5,"I cannot talk highly enough of this part of the group.
Been coming a lot of years."
The Peninsula,Change the day it is closed,10/26/2018,3,"At this surgery, could the day it is closed be changed, as having it closed on a Tuesday makes it 4 days closed when there is a Bank holiday weekend. Just feel it needs to be another day."
The Peninsula,Checked in at wrong surgery,10/26/2018,4,"Everything here is normally really good.  Today they are running behind and so I went to reception an hour after my appointment time, and discovered that I was supposed to be in at Alderton.  When I arrived however, I had been checked in here so do not sure why it was not picked up then."
The Peninsula,Chiropodist,4/29/2022,4,"I have no issues with the practice  except when I phoned last year on a Monday am to see if I could make an apt with the chiropodist I was told they were too busy  and to phone later on in the week. As it wasn't urgent I accepted that, though felt it wasn't going to take much effort to give me a chiropodist apt there and then!!"
The Peninsula,Closes in afternoons,8/3/2019,4,I don't like the fact that the practice closes most afternoons.
The Peninsula,Comments about Dispensary,1/11/2019,4,"I have noticed many times when picking up my prescription that the 'supplier' is different, which can be confusing.
Some medication is ready but have to make another trip for other items. Not sure why all is not ready at the same time - no explanation given."
The Peninsula,Concerns over blood test availability,8/11/2019,5,"On behalf of my parents I can compliment the surgery overall.
However, I must raise the issue around getting regular ""warfarin"" related blood tests. One of them driving to ALderton is really not ideal for this so I do hope they can sort out the bloods locally soon"
The Peninsula,Considerate,3/5/2022,5,"I have always found the practice to be very helpful and considerate, and have every confidence in them."
The Peninsula,Consultations...,3/5/2022,5,Good consultations with doctors and clinicians. Pharmacy very helpful.
The Peninsula,Could use zoom,4/29/2022,4,"I recently needed my skin checked by a dermatologist. Rather than make an appointment with my GP in order to get a referral, it all could have been handled so much more efficiently via a zoom"
The Peninsula,Dedicated staff,3/5/2022,4,The staff are dedicated and helpful.  I think the message on the answer phone is too long and maybe the receptionists are asking for too much information.
The Peninsula,Deserves kudos...,3/5/2022,5,The practice does a great job and deserves kudos for its good work.
The Peninsula,Efficient,4/29/2022,4,Efficient at calling back .Quality of care good
The Peninsula,Efficient staff,3/5/2022,5,"All the staff (medical and non medical, including especially those responsible for immunisations and pharmacy staff) have been extremely efficient and dedicated every time I have had contact with them. They go out of their way to help their patients, above and beyond just doing what is necessary."
The Peninsula,Emergency appointment,1/11/2019,5,"Rang today and got an emergency appointment with practitioner.
Couldn't wish for a better service."
The Peninsula,Essential to the village,8/3/2019,4,"This service is essential to the village and I've always had excellent provision, for my whole family.  The Doctor today was clear, considerate and professional.  Thank you!"
The Peninsula,Essentially good,3/5/2022,3,"Friendly staff. Essentially a good practice. Little bit chaotic in the dispensary in terms of consistently getting prescriptions right,  but that’s not the end of the world. The main issue is waiting’s times for calls and doctor access (in many cases) ."
The Peninsula,Everything very satisfactory,8/11/2019,5,Only been here a few months and find everything very satisfactory. The Nurse Practitioner is exceptional.
The Peninsula,Excellent,3/5/2022,5,I have always had excellent experiences particularly when my husband was terminally ill.
The Peninsula,Excellent care,4/29/2022,4,"During the last 20 years I have received excellent care when needed, when I had a cancer scare 9 years ago I was referred immediately and…..so far so good."
The Peninsula,Excellent service,4/29/2022,4,I have had excellent service recently mainly because one can now see and discuss problems directly.
The Peninsula,Excellent....,3/5/2022,5,Excellent response for same day appointments. Delighted to be informed of all the other services/ treatments and complimentary therapies.
The Peninsula,Face to face,3/5/2022,4,Like to see a doctor face to face not by telephone.
The Peninsula,Felt supported,3/5/2022,5,Always helpful staff and doctors. I have always felt supported and have been given great care
The Peninsula,Friendly,3/5/2022,5,"Easy to get appointments, friendly and experienced staff"
The Peninsula,Friendly...,3/5/2022,5,"Friendly, professional, convenient."
The Peninsula,getting used to new system,7/2/2020,4,"I didn't like the new 'call back system', when it first started, but I understand why it has been changed to that and I am now used to it. I have always needed to come in, so it just takes longer to get the appointment that you need with the GP."
The Peninsula,Good access,10/26/2018,5,"I rang at 8 am today and was given an appointment to see the GP immediately.  This is quite normal and I know it is a good service, so we are lucky."
The Peninsula,Good treatment all round,8/3/2019,5,"Whoever I have seen throughout my pregnancy, predominantly the midwife, I have received excellent treatment."
The Peninsula,Good...,3/5/2022,5,"Good, but delays in talking to specific doctors can be rather lengthy."
The Peninsula,Grateful for home visit,10/26/2018,4,I can get an appointment when I need one.  I was also very grateful for a home visit I had when particularly unwell and couldn't get out.
The Peninsula,Great surgery,10/26/2018,5,"Having many children in my care, I have appreciated the way the surgery is so helpful to me and to them."
The Peninsula,Happy with the service,8/3/2019,4,"My husband and I normally attend the surgery at Alderton.  His treatment is excellent.  I do no use the surgery as much, but when I do I am quite happy with the service."
The Peninsula,Happy with this surgery,6/4/2018,5,Very happy with this GP Practice in all aspects.
The Peninsula,Helpful,3/5/2022,5,"All the staff are helpful and proactive with a sensible attitude,"
The Peninsula,Helpful,3/5/2022,4,"Very helpful, try and offer suitable appointments"
The Peninsula,Helpful staff,8/3/2019,5,Get appointment when I need one and prescriptions get picked up on time.  The staff too are very helpful.
The Peninsula,I understand,3/5/2022,4,I wish I could book appointments in advance but understand the pressures you are under with doctor shortages and sickness absences
The Peninsula,Impressed...,3/5/2022,5,"I have only just joined the practice following a house move, but have been very impressed by all staff, how helpful they are, and the level of care I have received."
The Peninsula,Kind,3/5/2022,5,"Everyone is extremely kind , friendly and helpful always"
The Peninsula,Listened to,4/29/2022,4,I think the top thing is being listened to and things explained properly
The Peninsula,Location convenience,3/5/2022,2,Orford has poor service. To expect people to drive over to Hollesley and Alderton is unreasonable. It is quicker and easier to drive to saxmundham yet cannot change surgeries.
The Peninsula,Long message on phone,4/29/2022,4,"I occasionally contact pharmacy regarding medication for my son. It is always dealt with promptly and if there is a problem or query they will call me. 
There is a very long message when you call the surgery and often a wait until the doctor calls back. It is not as easy to get a face to face appointment as it used to be."
The Peninsula,Mixed experience,1/11/2019,4,"Appointments harder to get at Alderton, so try to come here, but not always a GP on site"
The Peninsula,Mixed feedback,3/5/2022,4,"While I understand the reasoning behind the system, it is very hit and miss. Some are helpful some are not. Can be extremely difficult to get an appointment at times. Much worse since practice expanded.  Often ask for information that is of a confidential nature and put under pressure to answer or not get an appointment. However, clinical staff are excellent."
The Peninsula,New patient here,8/3/2019,4,"I am new to the surgery but accessed an appointment today after speaking to a GP last evening. I find the surgery set unusual, as in that one surgery runs 'part time', so you would have to go quite a way to get to another surgery if you needed to see someone urgently.  For some people, that would be quite an issue."
The Peninsula,No follow up,3/5/2022,2,Servo Menta previously. Poor timescales on a consultant referral prior to Covid. No communication from practice when I ceased medicating. No follow up on information supplied. Procedure led to a misdiagnosis. Practice did not follow up at any stage.
The Peninsula,NO issues,3/5/2022,5,I have never had issues with our local surgery. All the GPs & clinicians I have seen have been professional & helpful
The Peninsula,Outstanding staff,3/5/2022,4,"I would like the opportunity to see a GP rather than a phone call or be given the choice please. 
I would like to be able to have more appointments in Orford.  
All the staff at all the surgeries I have been in contact with over recent months have been outstanding. Thank you."
The Peninsula,Point of note...,3/5/2022,5,When picking up prescriptions there is no way of letting them know that you are waiting.
The Peninsula,Positive experience,8/3/2019,5,"Always when I call, I get a appointment within 24 hours.  Staff are always patient and easy to deal with."
The Peninsula,Put down as a 'non attender',10/31/2018,4,"I was put down on the system as a 'non attender', yet I know that I would never had agreed to the appointment in the first place that they claimed I missed as I was away. The practice is very good on the whole."
The Peninsula,Reviews,3/5/2022,3,"I am coming up to my 55th birthday and I have not seen a doctor for many years.  I was under the impression I would have received an invite for a check up.  I have no idea of my blood pressure, if I have diabetes or any other condition that could may start at my age.  I’m aware there has been a pandemic and things are starting to get back to normal but as I have just called for a review of my medication I was shocked to still only be offered a telephone appointment."
The Peninsula,ring back system good,7/2/2020,4,"Found the ring back good because things sometimes do not need a face to face appointment, so it save your travel, especially at this time of year in the cold."
The Peninsula,Rushed and not interested,10/20/2020,1,Any time I call I feel rushed and the person I am speaking to comes across very disinterested in the reason for the call.
The Peninsula,See appropriate person,3/5/2022,5,I can also see or speak to the appropriate healthcare professional for my needs
The Peninsula,Short staffing affecting patients,1/11/2019,3,"When I started accessing this surgery a couple of years ago when we moved this way, everything was excellent.
I now have major concerns. They are short staffed and it is affecting patients.
I needed an urgent blood test last month and was told I'd have to wait 4 weeks, or go to Ipswich Hospital.
Today's appointment was made in advance for something quite basic and my nearest site is Alderton, but I've had to travel to Orford, which goes against what we are needing overall in society....to be 'greener'. If we have to travel further it doesn't bode well for the future."
The Peninsula,Thank you,3/5/2022,5,feel cared for  thank you  all at the practice
The Peninsula,The Peninsula Practice,10/21/2019,5,Find this local service excellent. Staff are lovely. GP's - lucky to have such lovely ones.
The Peninsula,Treat you well,3/5/2022,5,Really friendly staff who treat everyone as individuals and go out of their way to help
The Peninsula,Treated well,3/5/2022,5,I don’t use the surgery very much but I am always treated well by everyone.
The Peninsula,Treated with courtesy,3/5/2022,5,I have always been able to get an appointment when needed within a reasonable time. I am always treated with courtesy and in a professional manner..
The Peninsula,Variable care,8/3/2019,3,"Variable care here - depends on how you see GP wise.  Some have time to care and some you feel you are on a conveyor belt.  I came in once as had appointment with a GP, but when I checked in I was told I am seeing a Nurse Practitioner, which threw me slightly.  However, in fairness she was able to deal with my situation.  It is only natural to feel 'put out' initially though"
The Peninsula,Very clean,3/5/2022,5,Very Clean and fresh also not many people sat about ..pharmacy are particularly good aswell...polite staff too
The Peninsula,Very friendly,8/3/2019,5,Very friendly and accessible staff.  Excellent Healthcare.
The Peninsula,Website issue to raise,7/2/2020,4,"The website has a drop down that you can click on 'opening times', 'prescriptions' etc, however if you are not 'lightening quick' the drop down disappears and you just revert to the E-consult view. Just flagging it up, as it is very frustrating when you try move the cursor really quick and miss it before it disappears.
(CDO brought this up with the practice to look at)"
The Peninsula,Welcoming and caring,10/31/2018,5,I have only just started at this surgery and was able to register and get an appointment easily.  The staff are all welcoming and caring.
The Peninsula,Wrong items given,4/29/2022,4,GP and nurse care good. Needs improvement on prescribing medication as have personally experienced wrong items being given to me. Better system of repeat prescriptions needed to avoid wastage.
The Peninsula,Younger people,4/29/2022,4,"Good general GP service. But, as mother/carer of autistic teen, it was difficult to get info about jabs for my son during Covid epidemic. Also think they’re more focused on the elderly population than young people with mental health problems."
Two Rivers,Able to get an appointment on the day.,1/11/2016,4,Able to get an appointment on the day.  Appointment and building very nice.  Receptionists quite good.  Doctor a little rushed but he has a lot of people to see.
Two Rivers,All good for me.,10/22/2018,5,I called this morning and got an appointment on the day-can't ask more than that. It is the second time this week that I have called and got in on the day (same condition). I'm very happy with the clinicians that I see. Parking is marvellous-all good for me!
Two Rivers,All good so far,6/24/2022,5,"First time coming in for a face to face appointment, but up until now I have not needed face to face. When I had a secondary infection from Covid, antibiotics were prescribed on the telephone, which I felt was appropriate. All good so far!"
Two Rivers,All staff good,2/5/2023,4,"I am a long term patient, so seen different changes. Booking appointment for the vaccination 75+ clinic, waited more than 20 minutes in queue. Would like to have call queue number, as I would know how busy things were and would have possibly have tried later on, but not knowing, you hang on.
All the staff are good though when you see them."
Two Rivers,Always been excellent,8/9/2016,5,Haven't tried the new premises yet - but they have always been excellent
Two Rivers,"Always difficult, full Of self importance.",12/4/2018,2,"Trying to get some continuity of care, you can’t. Logic of 5 minute system is strange. Would work better with continuity of care as go would need to only ‘refresh’ memory.  Reading notes and having to ask for history from patients is your time gone. The gp is then already on the Backfoot. Patients are left feeling inconsequential  This is on top of the negative experience at reception."
Two Rivers,Always excellent care,12/4/2018,5,I've always had excellent care throughout my diagnosis and diabetes.
Two Rivers,Appointment remade,6/24/2022,4,"Yesterday I was 5 mins late and they would not see me, they made next day appointment straight away, which is good, however, when they don't run on time you risk a carpark fine! I had a one once of £100 if you went over the 30 minutes. I did appeal and got it back though. It just makes it a bit stressful.
I'd like to know where you are in the queue when you ring up as this has recently been stopped. It is good to know a rough idea of how much time you have when you call if you are limited you will try another day, but now there is no way of knowing."
Two Rivers,Appointment system,1/30/2018,3,"Appointments here are done in slots as they become available. If you do not want the time offered (E.G. 10.30am but want 11.30am) you are told that you have to call again later and take your chance. Reception can be overrun. However, it is better than it was when at Woodbridge road."
Two Rivers,Appointments available,8/9/2016,5,I was able to get an appointment on the day by telephone
Two Rivers,Better timing service required.,11/20/2017,2,Waiting 4 weeks to have ears syringed. Impossible to see own doctor so just see anyone.
Two Rivers,Can be difficult to get appointments,4/8/2017,4,Sometimes it is difficult to book an appointment. When I can't book my support worker helps me. It can take a week to get an appointment and I like that I can get my health checks done at my house by my GP. They are also helpful and I can get support to attend my appointments. Sometimes I find it hard to understand what is being said by staff.
Two Rivers,Can never get an appointment.,5/1/2017,4,Can never get an appointment.  Often on the phone for 2 hours without getting through.
Two Rivers,Cannot see the relevant GP,1/30/2018,3,There are 2 GP's here that specialise on skin conditions but I can never get an appointment with them. When I see a different GP they have to talk to the specialist GP anyway. Very frustrating. I find receptionists rude too. It always seems understaffed as the queue can be out the door with only one person see patients on the front desk.
Two Rivers,Care is varied but often poor to access,3/1/2020,2,"It's extremely difficult to get an appointment, often waiting 6 weeks in advance. Even more painful to get an appointment for my son. Was told to go to a service which my son couldn't access due to his age."
Two Rivers,Child not registered issues,1/30/2018,3,"I had my child and at 6 1/2 months the Health visitor referred us to 'Adult' physio which understandably was rejected. The second referral to 'acute' services was also rejected, then we saw the GP who then referred us to 'pediatrics' and they rejected it saying that the child was not registered at the surgery. This made no sense to me as we had had the letters for the immunisations. We ended up 7 weeks later finally getting the referral through, which was originally an 'URGENT' referral. A unnecessary delay due admin/communication errors."
Two Rivers,Choice of GP,3/5/2023,2,"I have been finding it impossible to see a GP of my choice or even the same one twice. I am not comfortable disclosing my complex conditions with different doctors and would prefer to see a female GP. I am feeling like they do not understand my complex conditions and as much as I try to explain to reception staff how it is important to me to see a female, they are unable to help with this."
Two Rivers,Come in to get appointment,3/5/2023,3,"I find it very difficult to get through on the telephone, so I have taken to walking into the surgery to ask for an appointment. It is my only option."
Two Rivers,Continuity,2/5/2023,4,Here since the surgery opened. Booking an appointment on phone 30-45 minutes wait. Only booking in advance available for nurses online. All staff though are really good one you get the appointment. I would like more continuity of care with my condition as you can feel you are starting from scratch each time you see someone different.
Two Rivers,Difficult here,3/5/2023,2,It is VERY difficult to get appointments and so I am seriously contemplating moving surgeries as it is so difficult here.
Two Rivers,Difficult to contact and hopeless website,8/27/2022,1,"The doctors are ok as are the reception staff, but [the website] is extremely difficult to navigate due to the limited choices available. There appears to be no way to contact the practice (except by phone) even though the website claims it is possible. If you're just asking about a basic problem where a quick message would suffice it doesn't seem possible so you have to waste both your own and the staff's time hanging on the phone."
Two Rivers,Difficult to get an appointment,11/8/2021,1,I need a medication review but for the past 2 months there have not been any available appointments when looking on system 1. This will cause me problems when I need to request future prescriptions. I get irritated when I'm continously repeating myself to justify getting an appointment. When you do get an appointment they regularly overrun and it appears that by always being late they don't respect the patient's time either.
Two Rivers,Difficult to get an appointment,8/9/2016,1,I book forward appointments online but during August and 9 there have been none available.  Feel let down by this.
Two Rivers,Doctor speaks to me,8/12/2017,4,"I'm happy that I can see my doctor, I do have to wait a little while in the surgery but I like that the doctor speaks to me and talked it all through with me when he did my blood pressure. The nurse did my blood test and she was friendly and I also had my annual health check."
Two Rivers,Doctors don't always talk to me,9/1/2017,2,My support worker books my appointments for me. Sometimes my doctor talks to my support worker rather than me.
Two Rivers,don't know who our named GP is anymore,8/17/2016,3,"In the Surgery newsletter they say we have a named GP, it would help if they could tell patients who their named GP is, because so many GP's have left and joined we don't know anymore."
Two Rivers,don't listen to me,10/24/2018,3,"I have had a bit of an ongoing problem over the last few appointments, which have all been about the same condition. I can't seem to get over what is wrong with me-they don't seem to listen to what I am saying. I find this frustrating and it is delaying me in getting access to the proper treatment that I need to correct the problem."
Two Rivers,Don't reply to complaints made 4 months ago,11/22/2019,1,"I made a complaint 4 months ago about the service I received.  I addressed it to 2 members of staff, one being the Practice Manager. I have emailed 3 times, phoned 4 times and still no reply.  Receptionists are not allowed to transfer the phone calls to the Practice Manager and I am not allowed to meet with the Practice Manager either! Disgusting patient care and customer service.  I have worked for the NHS and would be ashamed to ignore complaints and make it impossible for people to contact me.  Appointments are regularly cancelled too. Also remember to type your car reg number in the machine inside if you know you're going to be there over 1 hour, otherwise you'll get a parking ticket! It's a disgrace. Steer clear!"
Two Rivers,Dr spends a few minutes extra if I need it,10/24/2018,4,"I would have scored Woodbridge Road (now closed) a five stars, this is a four in my view. Doctors are great but the attitude of reception staff is variable. I have a preferred doctor who I see if I possibly can. He is an 'old fashioned doctor' who really listens to me and knows me. He often runs a bit late but I don't mind the wait because he finds a few extra minutes for me when I need it. The locums also run late but not for that same reason! I think that in this new, bigger surgery staff have lost the personal touch-I was known before and it doesn't feel like that now."
Two Rivers,Dr was amazing,1/9/2017,3,"The doctor, when I saw her, was amazing. However I had waited an hour after my appointment time with little explanation or idea of when I would be seen."
Two Rivers,Ease of  communication in BSL & booking.,4/29/2022,5,"HealthWatch Suffolk's project ""Your Care, Your Way"" had improved service for the Deaf patients like myself. Communication needs were requested and  highlighted on system whenever a request for appointment were made and British Sign Language interpreters were arranged for appointments without patients having to request for one. Communication & appointments can now be made by mobile phone text messaging."
Two Rivers,Every month for years a problem getting medic,10/13/2022,1,"For at least 4 years every month, my stoma supplies were not prescribed as requested. Despite many repeated clear instructions from the Stoma Nurse. They even started calling me to confirm, but still reduced the items that were required and requested with no explanation as to why. I could only assume it was a cost saving exercise. They have no idea about stoma products, and don’t understand that every stoma patient is different and have different needs. 

Never got to see a regular GP making it very difficult to get the right care with my complex specialised medical conditions.  Resulting in being given incorrect information or prescriptions not suited to my needs.  No follow ups if blood test are unremarkable leaving a problem to go on and on until I eventually just live with the problem as it's too frustrating trying to get a GP that understands. After 4 + years I finally broke down having to deal with constant mistakes and lack of understanding that I was forced to change GP surgeries. The new Surgery is amazing and has made me realise just how bad Two Rivers were. 

From the receptionists, many whom make you feel like your an inconvenience to the prescription team that cannot get orders right every month or understand the needs of a Stoma Patient, to many of the GPs that do not read or understand my medical history enough to treat me safely. 
Also they have changed the phone system now so you no longer know how many you are in the queue and just have to hold for up to 45 mins plus to get an answer."
Two Rivers,Everything is pretty good,7/17/2018,4,Everything is pretty good since the practices merged here at the new building. Good parking and a great building. Clinicians are fine. Only difficulty is the length of wait for a routine appointment.
Two Rivers,Excellent,7/3/2017,5,Surgery has been good.  I'm waiting for some tests at the hospital at the moment as I've fallen a few times.  I can get appointments when I need them
Two Rivers,Excellent care,6/7/2018,5,I have always had excellent care throughout my diagnosis of diabetes.
Two Rivers,EXcellent care,9/3/2018,5,I have always had excellent care throughout my diagnosis of diabetes.
Two Rivers,Excellent service.,1/8/2017,4,No complaints. Had follow up telephone call after one appointment in the past.. Excellent service
Two Rivers,Extended waiting times for an appointment,8/26/2017,4,Surgery called me on 16th August to make an urgent appointment for my daughter but the soonest they could make an appointment for was 11th 9. Otherwise a pretty good surgery.
Two Rivers,Fair but too few GP's and hard to get appointments,2/21/2017,3,"It's all very well spending money on a nice sparkly new building but surely this money could be better spent on attracting GPs to work there.  I cannot get an appointment,  Ringing at 8 am since August and all are gone. I am supposed to have my ongoing health conditions reviewed by GP.  I have given up"
Two Rivers,Fair. Receptionists ask too many questions,9/14/2017,3,"Saw nurse practitioner last time and didn't feel information given was enough and that he should have got a GP.
Don't like that the receptionist asks lots of questions..  If the system is that the receptionist gets you an appointment with what they say is ' the appropriate professional for your omplaint' my experience is that is does not work for me so far.  Being reliant on the bus service I find not being able to make an appointment for the next day really silly.  You can only use the system of ringing up on the day at 8 am.
I am having to think of moving surgeries; ADMITTEDLY THIS ONE IS NOT LOCAL NOW WE HAVE MOVED HOUSE"
Two Rivers,Feel service not as good,3/5/2023,3,"Generally things have been very good up until last few months. I've been a patient here most of my life. I feel things have deteriorating as it is very difficult to get an appointment and I have had issues with my medication too. I much preferred the phone system, where you knew where are in the queue too. I have found the GP online services good, however, you are stuck with the appointment you've been given and can't get though on the phone to change or cancel if you need to."
Two Rivers,Find a number of things difficult here,3/5/2023,2,"Once you see a GP or Nurse they are fantastic. It is however, so very difficult to get an appointment and talk to someone in person. In case of an emergency there is not way to get really urgent appointments, so have to go to A & E when it was not really the right thing, but I needed attention. There is no consistency of treatment and it is a worry.
I have had appointments cancelled on me quite often. 
The online system for repeat prescriptions is good but not so good for appointments."
Two Rivers,first rate,5/18/2022,5,"My wife and I have had numerous health issues, in and out of hospital and I get to see the same GP. I cannot sing their praises enough. I have regular check ups. Maybe it is because I am so ill that I get to see the same person and I hope that it the case for others if they are as ill as I am one day."
Two Rivers,Generally pleased with care,8/16/2018,5,Generally pleased with care. No issue to mention.
Two Rivers,Good,7/3/2019,4,"Education afternoons have proved very helpful.
Asked for drink of water after checking in;  receptionist did not mind at all.  Just long enough wait to sit after my walk to the surgery before appointment.  Some confusion as to why I had booked appointment originally - 5 weeks beforehand.
Good outcome, positive help with prescription provided.  Would not get so anxious if I had another appointment in the future.
The NHS still seems overstretched though."
Two Rivers,Good,5/1/2017,4,Very light and airy.  Would be good to encourage some more doctors.
Two Rivers,Good,5/1/2017,5,We have used Lattice Barn surgery for many years and always found them very good - caring and efficient.  We have had limited experience of the combined surgery but this was also found to be good.
Two Rivers,Good - excellent care,1/11/2016,4,"Diabetes specialist nurse.  
Since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (due to heredity factors rather than lifestyle) I have received excellent care from my GP"
Two Rivers,Good but long wait,2/5/2023,5,"In general I have a very good experience at appointments. Ringing in, you have a long wait, 45-50 mins generally in my experience, but I always receive an appointment on the day if I need one. I use the online appointment system as that can be a week plus for appointments. I have not had any 'bad' experience here."
Two Rivers,Good capacity for appointments,8/1/2018,5,Can always get appointment for me or my child when I need it.
Two Rivers,Good parking,3/5/2023,4,"On the whole things are ok, although trying to get an appointment is a long process.  The parking here is good which helps."
Two Rivers,Good service,3/5/2023,5,"This service is a good service. Telephone can be difficult, so I come in, in person to the surgery to get an appointment. I have no use of the computer. Wonderful staff and treatment, listened to and given full information with no jargon. I have found the HRT and Diabetic Nurses excellent."
Two Rivers,good service mainly,5/18/2022,4,this is a good service mainly.  Just would like to see the same GP myself for the complicated condition and calling 'on the day' means you end up with having to wait for ages and never can see same person as you don't know who is working then.  The GPs will be in high demand so it is difficult but I feel it is important when things are more complicated. it would give me confidence that things were more thorough.
Two Rivers,Good surgery overall,8/11/2019,4,"A good surgery overall who referred me very quickly to Ipswich Hospital Breast Clinic. Felt listened to, and taken seriously."
Two Rivers,Got better lately,10/29/2018,4,"This surgery has got much better in the last 6 months.  I can get appointment on the day easily now although taken a while to get through on the telephone.  Advanced appointments needed can be extremely advanced, like 5-6 weeks, which is rather long and does not work great for childs injections."
Two Rivers,GP criticising me for not breastfeeding,10/29/2018,3,"The GP criticised me for not feeding my child by breast.  Asked me why and I told him to look at my notes.  Then told me 'you didn't try hard enough'.  Made me feel awful, as i wanted to breast feed but due to the way in which my child was born I had found it impossible."
Two Rivers,GP is fantastic,8/9/2016,3,"I feel reception staff bad attitude ruins the experience of booking an appointment.  However, my GP is fantastic, I have known them for years and they explains all treatment.  I feel to improve there needs to be better appointment times, i.e. after six & weekends.  Also better access to female GP - I had to wait 2 weeks to have an appointment with a female GP
-"
Two Rivers,GPs don't listen as well as nurses,8/16/2018,3,Nurses are better than GPs in treatment explanations. GPs tend to be in a hurry. I'd like them to listen more. Nurses listened and I felt she was really interested in what I said and helping me. GPs should be better listeners and get better idea of bigger picture.
Two Rivers,Great service,3/5/2023,5,"Too long to get through on the phones but great service. You do get to speak to the right person. The carpark can get crowded, so can take a while to find a space, so have to give yourself plenty of time before appointment."
Two Rivers,Great service,5/18/2022,4,"When I have needed the service, it has been great. You don't know where you are in the queue now on the telephone which makes it difficult to know whether to hang on if you need to get somewhere.  All the staff are very pleasant"
Two Rivers,Happy with practice,2/5/2023,4,"Whilst I am happy with the practice, I have not used any other, so unable to compare. It can be difficult to get an appointment and if you are in pain, appointment in one month is not good, but get through on the day ok."
Two Rivers,Hard to get to see my regular GP,5/1/2017,4,With my ongoing medical condition it is hard to get to see my regular GP.  I end up giving up trying and have had to go to A & E on a couple of occasions as I needed to see someone on the day
Two Rivers,Hard work getting appointment,2/5/2023,4,"As it is hard work getting an appointment, it means I end up leaving problems too long then using on the day appointment system, when you can get one. Good experience with all staff."
Two Rivers,Have to carry phone around with you,2/5/2023,5,"Since opening here I have been a patient. Happy with the medical staff, but it is hard to get appointment (in vaccination clinic today). I have to carry my phone around when I ring in as you do not know if you are making progress in the queue, so you could be next or 20th."
Two Rivers,Have to wait,12/13/2017,3,They are a bit slow and you have to wait for appointments.
Two Rivers,I am fairly well content.,10/22/2018,4,I called in some time ago to book an appointment with a specific clinician. I was able to do this but I have had to wait three weeks which I suppose isn't too bad. I was at Lattice Barn before this opened and I don't think it is really much different. Overall I am fairly well content with how I am looked after.
Two Rivers,I am very pleased to be a patient here,10/22/2018,5,"I am very pleased to be a patient here. Much about it is better than Woodbridge Road (one of the two practices merged into Two Rivers) including accessibility and parking. Routine appointments are a bit of a wait (I book online) but if I am really poorly I can ring in and get an appointment on the day. It is a lovely building, nice and light. Staff are all pretty friendly."
Two Rivers,I decide before if I need Language line,11/16/2016,3,"I phone to make emergency appointments. I decide beforehand whether I need language line. If I do, I book 2 appointments. There is one GP who will not use Language Line. I never take appointments with her. Last time I went I had a problem with my toe. I used my English and was prescribed antibiotic cream."
Two Rivers,I rate it here!,10/24/2018,4,I don't come very often but I rate it here! It is so easy to get to and to park. I don't have an ongoing condition so my infrequent visits are always for different things so it doesn't bother me that I see a different doctor every time. They all seem pretty good anyway. I 'phone in when I do need an appointment and it is usually an 'on the day' thing. It can take a minute or two on the 'phone but nothing excessive so that is OK. Having the pharmacy on site also works really well for me. If I am given a prescription I can get it filled before I leave.
Two Rivers,I use online system,3/5/2023,4,"I have got appointments online. To do this I go on in the early hours when they have just released them. This is much better than trying to ring in and works better for me. If you miss them though, you have to try again."
Two Rivers,If you don't have e-mail you miss out,8/17/2016,3,"If you have e-mail then you receive the surgery newsletter which includes essential information about changes to services. However, for lots of people who don't have e-mail they miss out on that information."
Two Rivers,I'm happy to still come here,10/24/2018,4,"It seems more difficult to get a non urgent appointment than it used to be at Woodbridge Road. I'm here today with an 'on the day' appointment which has worked very well for me. Parking is certainly much better now and the building is light, spacious and more open. A nicer environment to wait in. As a whole family we probably come less than once a year so we aren't heavy/regular users. I happy to still come here even though it is further from my home (than Woodbridge Road was)."
Two Rivers,Impossible to see Doctor,8/24/2021,1,"87 year old father diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease by letter cannot get a follow up appointment. Also had chronic diarrhoea for two months. Colonoscopy came back clear so immediately discharged by hospital to care of GP, but getting weaker and got pains in stomach but again cannot see the Doctor. Nurse practitioner very nice but said she would get advice from hospital a week later still heard nothing."
Two Rivers,Improvement on the old surgery,5/1/2017,4,Sparkling clean new facilities.  Toilets seemed rather cramped.  I've yet to need a doctor's appointment but the purpose built rooms I've views are an improvement on the old surgery
Two Rivers,In and out too quickly,3/5/2023,3,"Too quick 'in and out' and not dealing with the issue.  Too long to get issues dealt with. If more time would be spent initially then the issue would be dealt with, saving time and inconvenience in the long run. 
I have not really struggled to get an appointment."
Two Rivers,Inaccessible - Failure in duty of care,7/1/2022,1,"Beginning of December 2021, I booked appointment for my young child.  Appointment was about 5 weeks away.  The week before, I receive a text notifying me that GP unavailable and appt has been cancelled and to call to rebook. I waited 35 mins on telephone to book that appointment being number 27 in the queue.  
Last year they commenced me on treatment (via telephone appt) and, as I was unable to get a repeat prescription without being seen and no appointment available to actually be seen, I had no choice but to reduce dose myself before finishing what I had remaining."
Two Rivers,Inaccurate diagnosis and referral,8/16/2018,1,"Surgery rang to say GP needed to see me. Nearest appointment was 6 weeks away to see this particular GP. I was referred to physio and wellbeing but physio, after assessment, said I needed surgery and wellbeing had no idea why I had been referred. When you ring for an appointment it can take ages to get through - I've been number 38 in the queue before now."
Two Rivers,It all works well,10/24/2018,5,I don't ever come to the surgery for myself-it is always for one of my children. I find it all works well-certainly at least as well as Woodbridge Road did. Plus I can always find a space in the car park so I don't have to park streets away and then drag a sick child through the pouring rain. Reception staff can seem a bit harassed at times but they remain professional and the doctors and nurses have always been good with my children.
Two Rivers,Its pretty well OK,10/22/2018,4,"I came here from Lattice Barn when the old practice closed. I telephone in to make any appointments that I might need. Rarely am I in the top 5 in the queue when I call but they all seem to be resolved fairly quickly. It isn't much different (to Lattice Barn) other than I no longer see the same doctors as I used to. It is all pretty well OK. The nurses are pretty good and for this course of treatment I have stayed with the same nurse, which is good. I don't use any of the other services that are located in the practice."
Two Rivers,Its really very good.,10/22/2018,5,"Appointment are pretty available for on the day. That said, when I called in this morning I was in a queue. I worked way from 19 to 16 and then I was cut off! I called back and was cut off again! I gave up at that point and tried again at 12.00, waited in the queue for 20 mins. but I did then get an appointment. Other than that (and being called in late) it is all really very good."
Two Rivers,Know where you are in queue,2/5/2023,4,"Getting through, not knowing where you are in the queue is frustrating. Can also end up not seeing right person. I had my hand go blue when I was given a blood pressure test by an clearly inexperienced member of the team."
Two Rivers,Lack of contiunity,11/24/2016,4,Due to lack of GP availability my wife had appointments with  4 different doctors to sort out medication.  This caused a problem because of lack of continuity.  Not good!  Long waiting times to see doctors and now even health care assistants.
Two Rivers,Lack reception staff needed to answer calls,8/17/2016,3,"Felt calm inside the new surgery and the staff were friendly. However, for an appointment I needed to call from 8 am, and when I called just after 8 am an automated voice said I was no.18 in the queue waiting for my call to be answered. May need more staff to answer the phone in the mornings."
Two Rivers,long wait for appointment,7/4/2017,2,I've waited 6 weeks for an appointment.  I ended up cancelling as no longer needed
Two Rivers,Long wait for important repeat prescription,5/25/2017,2,When I put my repeat prescription in to the surgery 5 days later the pharmacy did not have it.  It is for medication for my heart condition.  I was without it for 3 days.  I called he surgery and they put an emergency one through.  This has happened twice now
Two Rivers,Long wait to see own Doctor.,1/30/2019,3,"Because I had a Private medical examination I wanted to show the results to the doctor ascribed to me by the practice, had to wait three weeks for an appointment!"
Two Rivers,Lovely place.,1/9/2017,5,This is much better than Lattice Barn (used to be) as it is easier to get to. It is a lovely place and I wouldn't want to have to move surgeries. The information screens are great.
Two Rivers,Made getting the jab easy,12/2/2021,5,The staff and volunteers were very friendly and welcoming. They ran like clockwork and made sure I was well taken care of.
Two Rivers,Mixed experience of Dr's,8/9/2016,4,Surgery is new and looks great.  Doctor I had was new and I wasn't impressed by slightly blasé attitude.Didn't seem as sympatheic; but old doctors are good
Two Rivers,Mixed feedback,3/5/2023,4,"Not really have problems as such. The staff are very nice, but waiting times for appointments are too long.
The telephone call backs can be good and helpful."
Two Rivers,My diabetes management is superb,7/17/2018,5,I understand that getting an appointment can be difficult but it isn't an issue for me as I don't need to go very often. That said my diabetes management and care is superb-very professional and caring service
Two Rivers,New surgery that disappoints,11/23/2017,3,"Waiting to try and get an appointment is a nightmare and even then when it is a few days/weeks away you don't get to see the GP you would like. 'On the Day' appointments for a child are scarce. No one tells you why, you just get fobbed off. With this new surgery I thought things would get better, they just haven't and it must have cost a lot of money. What was the point?!"
Two Rivers,Nice building,5/1/2017,3,Lovely new building.  Just a problem getting an appointment initially.
Two Rivers,No complaints,9/14/2018,5,"We have been here since they opened and the service has always been good. I am under the same Nurse Practitioner for my appointments and she gets a GP in when needed, but that is not often. I like the continuity of that and most of the time they can deal with everything."
Two Rivers,No duty of care,11/23/2017,1,"It is a very long wait for an appointment, up to 3 weeks most of the time. It never runs on time when I see the GP or nurse, it is always 30 minute + behind. There is no duty of care or empathy with conditions/problems."
Two Rivers,No Ear syringing anymore,6/3/2019,4,"The surgery overall is very good. I cannot now get ear syringing at the surgery though.  I was just told 'don't do that any more'.  More information on 'why' would have been nice.  Things feel like they are being stopped 'stealthily', as you go to make the next appointment and that is when you find out it is no longer delivered."
Two Rivers,Not always easy to book appointment,10/27/2017,4,Not easy to book and appointment without giving full details to the receptionists first.
Two Rivers,Not easy to get appointments,8/20/2018,3,Can't easily get an appointment and its even harder to see a doctor of your choice which I do like to try to do.
Two Rivers,Not great with Visually Impaired,9/23/2022,3,"I am almost fully blind yet things need to be more adaptable in areas. I check in with reception and have to stand by the screen to try and see where I have to go without getting in the way of the screen. It is not too bad but I cannot move from there, and if they run late, can be there for quite a while. Once my name comes up I then have to work our the right direction to go as there are separate corridors to go down with different room numbers. Some times a clinician will come out and find me as I have taken too long to come to them. They NEVER offer to just do that for me."
Two Rivers,Not the best experience,8/1/2018,4,Getting an appointment can be sometimes be difficult. I have found staff can be rude at times when they are busy. Waiting room is always packed and they never run on time.
Two Rivers,On the day ok,3/5/2023,3,"On the day general stuff is ok here. I have however had problems getting heard about symptoms I believe are menopause related. As I am younger it was dismissed. It has now taken 2 months to get an appointment for a blood test and I am coming in for that next week. I felt dismissed and that I do not know my own body, but this does seem to run in our family and it is not really that uncommon. Meanwhile, I am struggling."
Two Rivers,Once you get to see a GP it is good,5/1/2017,4,Once you get to see a GP it is good. Rare to see my own GP; however I know this is a national problem and not just local.
Two Rivers,One issue at a time,3/5/2023,5,"Overall this is good, but you can only talk about one issue at a time, which can lead to more appointments.  I have found the nurses talk about something that is completely irrelevant.  This Surgery is a big improvement on my previous one in Suffolk."
Two Rivers,ongoing admin & accessibility issues,8/15/2018,3,"It's still very challenging obtaining an appointment, the partner GPs are rarely available, there's a 3-4 week wait for non-urgent appointments and then only with nurse practitioners. Frequent admin errors, wrong test ordered, no communication between GPs when different doctors seen, but in contrast their on the day/urgent system works very well. When you actually get to see a health professional they are excellent and v helpful but there is just no continuity of care which is how my 80 year old mum has had a UTI for a YEAR and no one does more than hand out a short course of antibiotics each time."
Two Rivers,Online appointments 4 weeks,2/5/2023,4,Getting appointment can be difficult to get on the phone or online. Showing 4 weeks appointments and often saying there are no appointments. All staff are good and generally helpful. Desperately need call queue numbers back so that we have some idea of the wait. Unfair to keep you hanging on not knowing if progress is being made.
Two Rivers,Overall my visits have been very satisfactory,5/1/2017,4,I'm new to this medical centre and have had 2 disappointment.  One was on time and one 1.5 hours wait in the waiting room due to a shortage of GPs.  Overall my visits have been very satisfactory.
Two Rivers,Overall not too bad,5/18/2022,4,"Getting through on the telephone can be the main issue, but when you get your appointment thing tend to run on time and everyone is lovely"
Two Rivers,Phone line frustration,5/18/2022,4,"It can just take ages to get through. I was needing to see someone in a week by they said I had to phone on that day to get appointment, which again is difficult. We are in for a jab today to go on holiday and were able to book the appointments 4 weeks apart for that, which was good as we could then plan our day."
Two Rivers,Phone system,2/5/2023,3,"Attending since they opened the surgery. Getting to see medical staff is extremely difficult. The phone system doesn't tell you your queue number, so no idea how long you will be holding on for, but it can be up to an hour. All the staff are good, and do their best. I need an annual review of medication which isn't automatically happening."
Two Rivers,Phone system for appts. works well,10/24/2018,4,"When I was a patient at Lattice Barn (now merged into Two Rivers) I always saw the same doctor, which I can't do here. In theory I can but in reality the 'appointment book' is full for a particular clinician right up to the end of current availability. I.E. for as long as it is open. So overall I don't think the new surgery is quite as good as the old but it is really marginal as there are some big advantages. I can 'phone for appointments and repeat prescriptions and the system works reasonably well. The car parking is much better too."
Two Rivers,Phoned for a same day appointment,5/24/2018,5,Great experience good initial phone assessment then offered appointment 40 mins later - understanding GP who took time to listen and ease concerns
Two Rivers,Polite and helpful,3/5/2023,4,"We are long term patients here. We find it quite difficult to get appointments though (in for vaccination today). We find we are waiting 45 + minutes in the queue, and it is very frustrating to have to carry the phone around with you not knowing where you are in the queue. All the staff are polite and helpful though. 
We do find that there is not any knowledge about our past history as we always have to explain due to not ever seeing the same person twice and it of course makes that more difficult too."
Two Rivers,"Polite, efficient, immediate appointment.",12/8/2019,5,"Through exploration into causes of illness, polite, not rushed, thorough explanation of tests, presented in a friendly manner."
Two Rivers,Poor - can't see my own GP.,1/8/2017,2,Can't see my GP who knows me and my history so have to explain to a new person every time I visit
Two Rivers,Poor - no continuity of service,4/5/2017,2,No continuity of the routine injection  - different nurse each time
Two Rivers,Poor car park and toilets,11/24/2016,2,"Poor road surface in the disabled parking.  It's on a slight slope which makes it impossible to line up the wheelchair with the car, so have to park the van on the open road now.  It is difficult to push wheelchair up the slope to the entrance when you are elderly.  Patient toilets are cramped."
Two Rivers,Poor communications and continuity of care,7/3/2017,2,Communication is poor.  Information from the hospital is limited when fed back via the surgery.  The continuity of care for an older person is important and this doesn't happen.  Getting to see someone is difficult but once you do they are generally good.  On one occasion a GP was due to visit but they never arrived and no one called to cancel.  There have been times when the waits are 3 weeks;  even to have a phone consultation was 2.5 weeks
Two Rivers,Prefer the new surgery,10/25/2016,4,"Much prefer going to the new Two Rivers surgery, more space, friendly staff and I've been able to get appointments when needed."
Two Rivers,Queue number gone,9/23/2022,5,"When calling the surgery they used to have where you are in the queue, which I preferred, as you at least know the time is going down as you go down a number. Not sure why it stopped."
Two Rivers,Reassured that if needed they would be there.,2/21/2017,4,Was informed before registering there were 3 appointments before mine (I was early anyway)so knew there would be a wait - only waited 30 minutes after appointment time. Extra appointment to usual routine appointments.  Reassured that if needed they would be there
Two Rivers,Receptionists are pretty good.,10/22/2018,4,"If I could change one thing about this practice it would be timeliness-I always seem to be called in late to my appointments. It is much easier to get to than Woodbridge Road used to be though. Car parking is much, much better. The doctors can book you a return appointment (within the consultation) which is good and the receptionists are always professional and helpful. I usually ring in to make an appointmet-on the day ones are really good but routine can be up to four weeks. The receptionists are pretty good at triage so sometimes an appointment isn't necessary."
Two Rivers,Routine appointments with nurse practitioner,3/4/2019,4,"Contacted two rivers after traumatic experiences. Receptionist (care home staff) understood that I felt my routine appointment ought to be brought forward because of this. Was given 3 appointments with different people (1 phone call review, + face to face appointments) (b-pressure, on going condition). The main problem I was presenting with, the action intended to take place as soon as possible. This will prove a little inconvenient (but necessary) due to transport complications. I was able to collect repeat medications in between appointments from the pharmacy adjoining the medical centre."
Two Rivers,Running late today,3/5/2023,3,"Today we are at least 20 minutes delayed for our pre-booked blood test appointment. I have very poor mobility so can seize up when sitting for a long time in one place. They buzzed us in, but as I am so slow, they then came out to call me too and then were very kind when they realised I was moving nowhere fast."
Two Rivers,Satisfied,5/1/2017,4,Satisfied on the whole.
Two Rivers,Seems much better here,10/22/2018,4,"I recently transferred her from another local practice where I wasn't very happy. It seems much better here based on my experience so far. It is certainly a much nicer building and environment, also I can park with no problem. I called today as I am feeling quite unwell (first clinical appointment) and I got an appointment for this afternoon which I think is great. All the staff I have had contact with have seemed friendly and professional."
Two Rivers,Site is very good.,10/22/2018,4,"I became part of this surgery when Lattice Barn closed and moved here. Nurses and doctors are exemplary-very professional. I use online booking-it is straight forward and easy-though it can be 4-6 weeks for a routine appointment with a specific clinician. Also I can wait 20-30 minutes after my appointment time to be called in. That is to do with demand I would guess. Nurses are much better than doctors at running to time. The site is very good, much better than Lattice Barn was. Clinically all the doctors and nurses seem very competent though I don't usually see the same one twice."
Two Rivers,Slow and no communication from GP or Staff,10/16/2021,1,"Handed a letter face to face with receptionist at the medical centre as I could not through on the phone . It was requesting my records to be sent to a Private heart consultant in Cambridge. Stating in my letter I was a private patient. After a week nothing was sent, I asked the heart consultant in Cambridge. So I then had to go back to the Two Rivers Medical Centre asking the question why my medical records were not forward on, as this was urgent. The receptionist [...] told me the doctor was confused. After waiting in a long queue at the medical centre, I asked why did no one contact me by phone or email. The receptionist just said sorry. I was amazed by it all. A simple request but no action, communication in this day and age. I [am] now leaving this practice as [I believe] it does not care about its patients, and [has] grown too big and lack of staff. There is no point in ringing the Medical centre as you be hold for hours, I tried all week. Face to face is the only answer, joining the long queue, so so frustrating listening to others in the queue complaining. This New Fabulous Health Centre is letting us the patients down. Lack of care. Lovely building. No Doctors or Staff."
Two Rivers,Staff are friendly,5/1/2017,5,All the staff - receptionists nurses and doctors - that I have had to interact with have been friendly but combined that with knowledge and efficiency.  Thanks to them all.
Two Rivers,Staff are very helpful,10/22/2018,4,I moved here when Lattice Barn closed. Staff are all very helpful with a single exception. One receptionist was unhelpful on a single occasion but that's all. Other than that it is all very good (there can be a slight lateness in being called in) and the parking has improved out of all recognition. The personal touch of seeing the same doctor has gone but they are all suitably qualified so that is OK.
Two Rivers,Steadily improved,10/23/2018,4,"The initial period after we all moved here from Lattice Barn (which closed) was bad-there really isn't any other way of describing it. The majority of the older doctors from Lattice Barn left and getting an appointment was very difficult. All sorts of work has obviously gone on behind the scenes and things have steadily improved to the point where I would now say it is pretty good. I am here today having secured an 'on the day' appointment without too much waiting in the 'phone queue. Also, my husband's diabetes reviews are maintained very efficiently every six months by the practice's system which I find very reassuring and excellent."
Two Rivers,Struggling to get results,3/5/2023,3,"I have been struggling to get result from a recent scan and I am feeling worried about the possible diagnosis. I haven't been able to book an appointment yet.  I do not use a computer but very happy with using the phone to book appointments, but struggling to do so."
Two Rivers,Text reminders good,3/5/2023,5,"I do not use the service very often, but for me, I have always been able to get an appointment when I have needed one.  I have found the ring back by the GP sometimes suffices. The text reminders are very helpful too."
Two Rivers,They always have someone there to support me,9/1/2017,5,I have a speech impairment so the doctor always organizes someone to be in the room with me. Sometimes they do not understand me easily and I also find it difficult at times. I do like the surgery.
Two Rivers,Toilets are poorly designed,11/24/2016,2,"The toilets are very cramped with huge sinks.  I am slim and struggle to get past, so any one not so slim would have major issues.  A place like this should have got it right from the start !"
Two Rivers,Too nice to tell him,10/24/2018,4,"We transferred here when Lattice Barn closed. My husband has had a diagnosis of diabetes for some years and he was only recently told unequivocally that it was important for him to lose weight. He had never been told that directly before and it did have an impact. Previously it was almost as if clinicians were too nice to tell him outright. Also, when I accompany him to appointments his diabetes often isn't taken into consideration when he presents for other issues-this must waste resource. Finally he went the diabetes training (DEBRA) last week but only after I had asked about it. He found it very helpful and it is a shame he didn't go years ago."
Two Rivers,Upset patient,3/4/2019,3,"The problem is a recurring problem. You ring to speak to reception, to find out test results or to make an appointment, and the recorded message when told to press button 2 too speak to someone. It just starts at the beginning again. This is about the 4th time it's happened in the last month. When you live a distance away it's no help at all."
Two Rivers,Vaccination - turned away,2/5/2023,2,"Patient booked into the vaccination clinic as had a text asking them to.
The appointment ran 30 minutes late. Once they got in they were told that as they were not 75 years old until 3 weeks time, they could not give it to them."
Two Rivers,Very clear and helpful,10/23/2018,5,"I had a very bad cough which I feared was a chest infection (I provide transport and support for an elderly woman who has cancer and is on palliative care) so I called the surgery at 3.00pm on a Friday afternoon. I was told I could turn up and sit and wait that afternoon but there wasn't any guarantee that I could be seen (which I could understand), I could call on Monday for an on the day appointment or have an appointment at GP Plus at Riverside that evening. The receptionist made all this very clear and understandable to me so I could make an informed choice (which was GP Plus)."
Two Rivers,Very few online appointments,3/5/2023,4,It is not easy to get appointments and it feels very difficult with the systems. Online there are only a few appointments. Once you do see someone they are very good and the team here on Reception are lovely too.
Two Rivers,Very friendly and helpful staff,12/15/2020,5,The staff at all levels at Two Rivers are all excellent. They are very professional and always calm and helpful. It’s a very large and busy practice but it is very well organised and the layout is easy to follow.
Two Rivers,Very frustrating booking system,6/18/2019,3,"I tried to ring up to get an appointment 2-3 weeks ago and the answerphone just kept repeating over and over for ages so I decided to hang up and get in my car and go and see them face to face. Very frustrating and concerning.
You also can't book appointments ahead, and there is a distinct lack of GP consistency."
Two Rivers,Very good but long wait to see GP,12/14/2016,5,"Getting an appointment has not been an issue but waiting to see a doctor was quite long.  The doctor I saw was nice and I was happy the appointment.
Information given is limited and they don't have time to go into detail with you.  If continuuity had been better I feel that my brain tumour would have been picked up sooner,  Because I saw different doctors each time they weren't building up a picture of what was happening and everything was seen in isolation"
Two Rivers,Very grateful,8/1/2019,4,I had personal concerns about my condition following time spent in the emergency department. I was very grateful for the receptionist's and care navigator's decision to offer me the GP of my choice for the follow-up appointment when I rang after discharge. The appointment has helped me to have a more balanced approach to any future needs.
Two Rivers,Wait but not get seen,12/16/2021,1,"My dad cannot speak English, he went to his appointment at 9:10am and waited till 10:40am and they didn’t get him in then when he went back downstairs to find out why he hasn’t been called receptionist must of not marked him in and they can’t do anything about it. 

Then when they try to arrange another appointment lady, she arranged another appointment top of her head without asking if the date is convenient for him then when I said you can’t just book appointment top of your head she said there is too much queue my dad needs to go she needs to deal with other patients and I said to her without sorting your current patient you can’t just deal with other patients but then she’s like shes helping for the day at the riverside if I’m not happy then I can speak to manager over the phone. Is this how you deal with your patients? He waited for such a long time on top your dealing like that? 

Two riverside service is really going down and you really need to take it seriously with your patients because even last time when my dad come home he didn’t feel comfortable with the doctor as my dad cant Speak English the doctor seemed shouting at him and had attitude due to him not speaking and I made complaint straight away back then too and said I don’t want any appointments to be made with that dr.  

Riverside really needs to sort how to deal with patients, you don’t accept tolerating or attitude in the gp but you do it to your patients is that right? 


Don’t get treated equally here especially if you cannot speak English"
Two Rivers,Wait on telephone,5/18/2022,4,"Do not come to the surgery often, but when I do it all is ok. My only wish is the telephone waiting should be less. I can wait 20 minutes which is difficult when you work shifts and on call. I am sometimes calling in the afternoon, but you have no hope of appointment, you just get 'ring back at 8am'. Well that does not work for everyone. Using the E-consult is far too long winded, again, my time is limited."
Two Rivers,Waiting to see how good waiting times are,10/10/2016,4,I HOPE THE WAITING TIMES ARE BETTER THAN WOODBRIDGE ROAD
Two Rivers,Went to surgery but couldn't see a GP.,5/1/2017,4,Went to surgery but couldn't see GP.  Foot was extremely painful from infection.  Only needed antibiotics so it was silly that I ended up at Ipswich Hospital A & E
Two Rivers,where in the queue,5/18/2022,3,"As a busy parent I would like to know where you are in the queue. I can put the phone on speaker and do a few things if I know I have a good number of places to go. I don't mind that, but since they stopped that, I cannot get on as I am worried that someone is suddenly going to speak to me and I won't be quite ready.  We also recently needed a 2-week follow up, but told we would have to ring on the day and take our chances as they could not access the system to book us in. Very frustrating. They do advanced appointments normally so not sure why this could not be done.  So then you have to diarise the day and have the stress of trying to get through in the hope you can see that same person again!"
Two Rivers,Wonderful team of people,11/16/2022,5,"Having been at the old Woodbridge Rd surgery for many years [...], we were sorry that they had closed and become part a new practice where things were not the old familiar comfort you seek when you are not well. Two Rivers have been amazing, from first port of call reception, then to navigation to the right medical professionals. All have been friendly, compassionate and, even though they are so busy, they take the time to listen and do their best to resolve issues. They are our go to in times of need and have never let us down."
Two Rivers,works fairly well,10/22/2018,4,I transferred when Woodbridge Road closed. Parking here is much better and the building is really light and airy-much better environment! The queue for the flu clinic was really bad-I waited 45 minutes. I'm not sure that they had optimised traffic flow though I'm no expert. I book online for routine appointments but I phone in if it is more urgent for an 'on the day' appointment. All of that seems to work fairly well and though I don't see the same doctor twice they all seem to be very professional and compassionate.

Unity,A bit hit and miss,3/13/2023,4,Econsult is long winded and you have to repeat yourself and there seem to be irrelevant questions and I just end up putting information in to be able to move to the next bit. Its a bit hit and miss being able to get appointments too but other than that the surgery is ok and staff are friendly.
Unity,A decent surgery with challenges,6/11/2018,4,I have been a patient here for some years. I have always found it to be a decent surgery but with challenges. Access to appointments is currently quite difficult as they try different booking systems to try to get a handle on demand. I have a baby and he can get unwell quite quickly at times which is a real worry for me. In this regard I miss the 'sit and wait' system which did provide a consultation to those ill enough to decide to wait.
Unity,A good surgery,12/10/2022,5,There is a simple process in place to get appointments and if you compare now to years ago it is much quicker and easier to get the help when its needed.
Unity,Access is frustrating,12/10/2022,4,In terms of access to the surgery by phone it is frustrating due to the time it takes to get through.  My flu jab was faultless today but I have had issues with blood test results not appearing on the app and I had to go through a nurse who could see them to get feedback.
Unity,Access is over the phone,11/11/2021,3,All access is over the phone which isn't great and I do feel that getting actual appointments with doctors is difficult but you can get to see a nurse more easily and they do a great job. I just don't feel that everything can be dealt with over the phone. For general things it is quite a good surgery but I do struggle to communicate with some staff and being on the phone makes it more challenging.
Unity,Access to surgery by phone is difficult,10/25/2019,5,"Its difficult to get an appointment, getting access to the surgery by phone is very difficult, I do wish this could be better. I sometimes just drive up to the surgery to speak with the receptionist face to face."
Unity,All doctors are good here,9/14/2018,5,The surgery is clean but shabby-chair coverings are worn through. That said they have saved my life two or three times now! My cancer was diagnosed very quickly and I was off to hospital without delay. All the doctors are good but I don't get the opportunity to see the same doctor twice. I called this morning at 8.00 on the dot and was 16th in the queue-it took 4 minutes per person to clear! All things considered they do a pretty good job with what they have got.
Unity,All good,2/19/2020,5,"No complaints here, all good service."
Unity,All worked like clockwork,7/2/2019,5,I have only been registered here for just over a year following a move to Haverhill. I have only been in a couple of times but for me it has all worked like clockwork. I was 10 minutes going in on one occasion but that is really nothing at all.
Unity,All works very well for me.,7/2/2019,5,I haven't had any problems with any part of the surgery set up-it all works very well for me.
Unity,Always amicable with me,2/19/2020,4,"The staff are always amicable with me, they do try to help you here and overall they are very good. They managed to find me another appointment today as my car broke down this morning and they called me back and got me for a later appointment."
Unity,Always been good to me here,2/12/2019,5,They have always been good to me here. Ringing for appointment is the only issue. I could suggest that if they do not have any appointments available on the day could they not have a message on the answerphone to say there are none left rather than allow the person to hold for a long time and then to be informed that they have none left?
Unity,Always late being called in.,9/15/2018,2,"I am always late being called in-up to 30 minutes isn't unusual. I travel in by taxi and one day my taxi was late arriving and hence I was 15 minutes late arriving here. I wasn't allowed in and I suspect I have gone down as one of the people who didn't show for their appointment. Appointments can now only be booked on the day by 'phone. Call and wait in queue, expensive if like me you have to pay for your calls. Even if a doctor tells me to come back in seven days I can't book till the day. Nurses can and do book second appointments. Also I have been given an appointment because the person I saw first time couldn't write me a prescription so I had to come back and see someone else a couple of days later (another taxi) I had no idea I was seeing someone who couldn't prescribe."
Unity,Always problem with the appointment,3/16/2016,1,"Poor customer service. Booking system is not well organized. Staff need customer service training, need to  listen to patients needs."
Unity,Appalling,9/16/2015,1,"My father went into the surgery as he was shopping nearby , he was advised by his gp to make an appointment in 9 . He was informed by the receptionist he could only make appointments between 1-2pm!.my father is over 75 , diabetic. This is not a service provider.The surgery needs to be looked at in more depth, this is not the 1st time this has happened. I am appalled , I am a practice nurse in a nearby county and there would be an investigation why this gp practice performs in this way.
N"
Unity,Appointment system is ludricous,10/27/2015,1,The appointments system is ludicrous. Having to wait a week or sit and wait. The surgery hour are 0800-1800 yet the duty doctor is a 'no show' until 0830.
Unity,Appointments,3/25/2016,1,Appointments system is appalling.
Unity,Appointments are fine,12/11/2021,4,I've found that getting an appointment is fine and I've had them when ever they have been needed. There are no problems with staff they've always been good and although I'm fairly new to the practice everything has been fine so far.
Unity,Appointments fine to get,5/27/2022,5,I call the surgery to get appointments and I've had no issues getting them. It might be that you have a telephone conversation with a GP before coming in for an appointment but it all works well for me.
Unity,Appointments system is not good,2/12/2019,4,"Doctors are good here, appointment system is not good as you do have to wait so long before the phone is answered, it was 11 mins today,  its always a bit of a gamble if I can get in on the day. I do have to wait for up to 30 mins before I get called into the surgery which is frustration as my husband has dementia and I have to collect him from the day centre. If the access to the surgery with the view to making an appointment was improved it would make it so much better."
Unity,"Awful only emergency appointments,",1/4/2019,1,"Only allowed to book an emergency appoint, have to phone on the day for an appoint, and can never get through. No routine appoints. Receptionists having to know why your phoning, my records are not even correct,"
Unity,Bad mental health treatment and they are rude,9/11/2017,1,"Suffered with mental health most of my life, they are rude and dismissive. Will no longer visit my GP because of this."
Unity,Been good this morning,12/11/2021,4,"Its worked well this morning, I went through the telephone triage and spoke to a GP who then arranged for me to come in to the surgery to be seen  and its all been good. The GP was lovely and explained everything really well. In the past it has been more difficult to access appointments."
Unity,Being referred on,12/11/2021,3,I do find that it is difficult to actually see a GP and I can't understand why they won't do anything for my knees and just keep telling me to self refer to Allied Health Professionals.
Unity,Better over the last couple of years.,7/2/2019,4,I've never been here and and been called in on time. I would expect a delay of 30 minutes on average though nurses are more timely. The surgery has got better over the last couple of years but not ever seeing the same doctor twice is a bit of a drawback.
Unity,Better than it used to be,10/22/2018,3,"I think this practice is now better than it used to be. For example, i was pleasantly surprised to telephone in today and get an appointment for today! I have never had a problem with the doctors, only in accessing them in the past. The general cleanliness here is pretty good but it is really bad (cobwebs, dead flies and dust) In the high exposed, hard to reach places. Receptionists can be a bit abrupt sometimes on the 'phone but I would think that is down to the pressure they are under. Overall not bad now!"
Unity,Bit of a queue on phone,12/11/2021,3,There's a bit of a queue in the morning's when trying to get through to the surgery. The issue we've had today is that we booked our flu vaccination but weren't told we couldn't have it with in a week of having our covid booster so we've had two wasted appointments today. Our medications are delivered by the surgery and this is great and works so well.
Unity,Booking appointments is okay,3/14/2023,3,"I received a letter inviting me in for my review and I was able to arrange the appointment with no issues.  I do find that econsult asks a lot of unnecessary questions and isn't easy to use. I have had difficulties getting my medication at times, if the surgery is tied in to a certain supplier they can't always get what is needed."
Unity,Brilliant,3/14/2023,5,Its a brilliant surgery with friendly and polite staff especially the nurses.  The service is 100% as I'm able to get appointments whenever needed.  Speaking on the phone with the doctor has worked well and addresses the issues and I really like the doctor I've seen as they take time with you.
Unity,Called today and I have an appointment!,7/2/2019,5,I made a telephone call this morning at 8.00 and here I am waiting for an appointment at 10.30 which I think is fantastic!! I called at 8.00 and all lines were engaged. I called back at 8.10 and was in a queue of 20 but it cleared remarkably quickly.
Unity,Calling at 1.00 seems better,9/15/2018,4,"It works well for me, calling at 1.00 seems better for me than some of the previous systems. I don't often see the same doctor twice but that is ok for me. They seem a pretty friendly bunch."
Unity,Calling at 1.00 worked better,9/15/2018,4,I was on the 'phone for 30 minutes on Monday and when I was finally answered I was told all the appointments had gone. On Tuesday I got an appointment. I have to pay for my calls but I will say that calling at 1.00 worked better. The appointment thing is a shame because I rate the doctors and nurses.
Unity,Calling the surgery is expensive,5/31/2022,4,"I have no access to the internet and only a pay as you go mobile phone so having the ability to go in to the surgery to book appointments is really important to me. Being on hold for so long when you are trying to get through can cost a fortune, last week it cost me £10 and I can't afford to wait on the phone to get through to reception. I'd like to be able to see a GP for an update but haven't had any luck yet. I do find the diabetes nurse and the check ups she does great."
Unity,Can never get through,2/5/2016,1,I can never get through-I tried off and on for one and a half hours but I couldn't get through. There were no appointments available on the website either.
Unity,Can wait up to 30 mins on phone,10/25/2019,4,"I can wait up to 30 mins on the phone before I get through, but generally I find this surgery to be ok."
Unity,Can’t get an appointment,1/15/2019,1,Impossible to get an appointment have to hold on the phone for up to an hour to be told to call back at 1pm as no appointments available this morning. Happens not just once but regularly.
Unity,Cant get an app[oinment,7/1/2016,1,"I have tried many tines to get a non-emergency appointment but can't get beyond the voicemail message saying there are no appointments available. Even trying online AND on the phone at the same time, all appointments for the following week were (supposedly) gone by 8.04 am-- Lines only open at 8!!!!!"
Unity,Can't get appointment,3/25/2016,1,New system doesn't work for patients.
Unity,can't get appointment when i need it,11/25/2019,3,I only contact the doctor when I need to see them over something I believe i need help with. I ring or go to the surgery. am told this has changed now you can't do that. what is wrong with you. I am told to ring at 8 or 1 pm when I ring I am 28th in line and its 2 minutes past 8 or 1. when I do get through told all appointment gone. been with this practise for 15 years. was once a helpful place now you get spoke to like your an inconvenience. the receptionist are like machines and have little care for you.
Unity,Can't think of anything I would change,10/25/2019,3,"Overall I am pretty happy with this surgery, I cant think of anything I would change."
Unity,Care navigation is frustrating,10/25/2019,3,"It would be useful to have the consistency of the same GP, to have regular doctors instead of locums is important. I do find care navigation frustrating I don't like them asking so many questions."
Unity,Clean Service!,2/19/2019,4,"Direct, Informative with passion for Health Care."
Unity,Clinically it's all ok,9/15/2018,4,"Clinically it is all ok. I am a carer (for my husband) and the system isn't flexible enough for me.  8.00 call doesn't work at all well as that is when i am getting him up for the day. It would be good if there were 'protected' appointments for certain categories of patients, i.e. carers."
Unity,Closure makes it less convenient,12/11/2021,3,The closure of the Steeple Bumpstead surgery has made it less convenient for us especially when you have to pick medication up from the dispensary which has limited opening hours.  We have found that using econsult has led to issues being dismissed as it was assumed my husband was too young to be having the problems he was. We ended up going private and this confirmed that treat was needed. Staff are great when you do get to see them but our experience has shown that econsult is not always the right option and doesn't suit everyone either.
Unity,Diabetic screening stopped,9/16/2022,2,I am diabetic and I was trying to lose weight but because my screening wasn't available I had a hypo. It took 4 hours for the paramedic who came out to be able to get a GP to agree what my insulin could be reduce to.
Unity,Difficult to get an appointment,2/12/2019,3,"It is very difficult to get at appointment, I waited several days to get through. If they sorted out getting through and the appointments it would be so much better."
Unity,Difficult to get an appointment,10/25/2019,4,It is difficult to get an appointment on the phone and I wish I could just come in and wait to be seen by a GP however long it takes. I don't feel the GP's are providing good value for money and I think they are paid way too much for what they do.
Unity,Difficult to see a GP,11/11/2021,3,It's very difficult to get to see a GP at the surgery and the reliance on online access does not suit everybody.
Unity,Discrimination with appointments,7/31/2015,1,In my experience booking on-line means an earlier appointment. That doesn't seem fair to me. Discrimination in relations to age/ Income?
Unity,Do not like econsult,9/16/2022,3,"I really do not like econsult as you can't put down everything that you feel might be wrong or need to say, it's too prescriptive."
Unity,Doctors are lovely,2/12/2019,4,"Doctors are lovely, getting seen is quite tricky but I know its not their fault. There doesn't seem to be enough doctors to cope with the amount of patients. Would be good to have a children's activity."
Unity,Doctors are pretty good,9/14/2018,4,The doctors are pretty good and the new appointment system worked well for me this morning. I had to wait a bit to get through but that was ok. It took me less time than walking up to the surgery and back (to make an appointment as I did previously)
Unity,Doesn't work well for me.,1/11/2018,1,The appointment system doesn't work well for me now. It was better when I could walk in to reception and make an appointment face to face. We are retired and not that mobile and we are also very conscious that it costs us money to hang on waiting in the queue to try for an appointment.
Unity,Don't get ill - you can't book an appointment,3/21/2016,1,"Terrible, can't get to prebook an appointment.  Have to queue outside from about 7.30-7.45 until doors open at 8am to get make appointment.  Then may have to wait hours to actually see someone.  I work over an hour away from the surgery, and I end up taking 1/2 a days holiday if I need to see a doctor.  What happens is that it's so difficult I just dont go, I know this is bad as I am suffering!  They do not care about patient care, it is terrible!!   Your appointment when you actually get one is rushed, if you go in with a list of things (as taken so long to get to see someone) they get agitated and say you need to book another appointment - they do not realise or care that it is virtually impossible to book one in the first place!"
Unity,Don't like econsult,5/30/2022,4,I don't like using econsult as I'm not used to using computers and find it difficult but if you don't use it you have to call either first thing or at lunchtime to try and get a chat with a GP.  The GPs still haven't received my letter from the hospital so haven't been able to action the medicine changes. I've had to take my letter in so they can copy it and then act on the changes.
Unity,Drs all want to help,6/11/2018,4,If I could change one thing it would be access to appointments. I called in yesterday and I was told that all the doctors were off sick-which I suppose happens from time to time. I called on the dot of 8.00 today and I was 8th in the queue but I did get an appointment for this morning. When you do get in to see them the doctors do all want to help-they are approachable. Nurse practitioners are also good.
Unity,Drs and Nurses are generally ok,7/2/2019,3,I am 20 minutes late (so far) this morning but I have waited up to an hour. I struggle with the appointment system-it took me four days of phoning in to get an appointment. Drs and Nurses are generally ok
Unity,Drs and Nurses are great,1/11/2018,4,It is all around access to appointments. Doctors and Nurses themselves are really great when you can get to see them.
Unity,eConsult experience,2/19/2020,3,"It took me 30mins to fill in the eConsult form and the GP called me back the next day and gave me an appointment the same day, even though it took a while to fill it in they did well in getting back to me and getting me an appointment."
Unity,Econsult gets quick response,11/11/2021,5,I've used econsult and find that you get a quick reply and its easy to use. Some of the questions aren't overly relevant or applicable but I just write everything down. I tend to see the nurses rather than a GP but it works well and addresses the issues. The staff are friendly and welcoming and I find the surgery good.
Unity,Econsult isn't user friendly,3/14/2023,3,"I really don't like econsult as I don't find it a user friendly system to complete. If I don't feel well I really can't face going through it all, it would be so much easier to just call. I find that it makes me less likely to contact the surgery as it is more of a hassle."
Unity,Econsult very good,12/10/2022,3,"Econsult is very good, I do like to use the system as it has real benefits but it does draw things out as you can't discuss issues and the responses are short and don't adequately explain or address issues. I don't feel I've had a full explanation about whats happening around starting a new medication and my concerns haven't been taken seriously. There are times when you just need to see someone and the perception is that they want to keep you at arms length."
Unity,ES Could be better,12/10/2022,3,"I feel that I get passed from person to person and prefer a face to face appointment to discuss issues. I'd prefer to just be able to come to the surgery and just book an appointment, however, when I have called and spoken to a GP they have offered an appointment with them.  Staff  are nice and caring."
Unity,fair,6/21/2016,3,Receptionist said I can't get an appointment this week or next.  So we rang and they told me to go to the other one
Unity,Fantastic. Especially the girls in dispensary,1/18/2022,5,Fantastic
Unity,Fine at the moment,11/11/2021,4,"I visited the surgery to pick up medication from the dispensary on Saturday  but the opening hours have changed although the website still says the old hours. Staff at the surgery are great when you see them, I don't need appointments often but it works well for getting medication."
Unity,First class for me,3/12/2018,5,I've never had any kind of difficulty (at this practice). It has always been first class for me. I support other (vulnerable) people in the community and as far as I know they don't struggle either.
Unity,Friendly and Polite,2/19/2020,5,The staff are always friendly and polite. The only thing is that I cannot hear very well when my name is being called from along the corridor by the doctor.
Unity,Friendly staff,3/14/2023,4,"I was invited in for my appointment today and getting it arranged was no problem. I've also not had any issues getting general appointments when they've been needed either. The staff are friendly and good at helping to sort issues out and the nurse I've seen was lovely, really relaxed me and made me laugh.  Econsult has worked well to get appointments too and the surgery is a nice environment to be in."
Unity,Getting access on the phone is very difficult,2/12/2019,3,"No consistency of GP. Getting access to the surgery is very difficult, I wait regularly about 20-25 mins before the phone is answered. The ladies on the front desk are very good, they do try their best but I feel they are up against it."
Unity,Good,3/14/2023,4,At the moment the surgery has been good. I like that text messages are sent out to confirm the appointment once it is booked and I've been invited in for an annual blood test. Staff are friendly and my medication review was done by phone which worked well. The last doctor I saw was very through and I was pleased with how the appointment went. My medication is delivered which is really helpful.  They phone to say when it is coming and they always arrive on time.
Unity,Good recently,12/10/2022,4,My last two visits have been good. I had never had an annual reveiw so called the surgery to request one and I was given an appointment with a lovely nurse who was very thorough and helpful. She explained when my blood test results are back that I will need to have an appointment with a GP and she explained how to do this.
Unity,Good staff,3/14/2023,4,"I had no problems booking my blood test for today. I find the online system easy to use and has led to appointments.  Staff have been good, the only issue is communication at times as it can be a bit difficult to get information back and I've had to chase for it."
Unity,Good staff,2/12/2019,5,"No problems at all, good doctors here, good staff, nothing needs to change as far as I am concerned, quite happy."
Unity,Good surgery,3/14/2023,5,The surgery have been able to respond quickly when I've needed help and staff show concern when I explain what the issues are. My appointment today was for a medication review which was easy to arrange.  I've also had quick referrals through to the hospital last year when the doctor was concerned. I've had no problems with the surgery.
Unity,GP consistency could be improved,2/19/2020,4,There is a nice welcome on arrival at the surgery. When you phone in you usually end up being on the phone 20-30 mins before you can get through. I think the reception staff seem a bit stressed at times. GP consistency could be better.
Unity,Gp refused appointment,2/20/2020,1,I made request for GP appointment  2 times and called also 111 who sent note to gp that I have to be seen within 24 hours. GP has refused to give me appoitment as I'm not red flag.This is ridiculous. This GP should have more understanding of people needs!!!
Unity,Happier to call the surgery,5/27/2022,4,"I have no problems getting appointments this way and any issues always get sorted out. I see the nurses most frequently and I'm completely happy with the care they provide, they're great, I haven't seen a GP for a few years. It's a shame the surgery no longer deliver medication that was really helpful."
Unity,Happy with the process in place,12/11/2021,5,"I did an econsult on Friday and the doctor asked me to drop a sample off but I arrived late in the afternoon and all the samples had been sent off already so I've had to come back in with a second sample today, not a big issue or urgent so happy with how it's all working."
Unity,Hard to get through on phone,12/10/2022,4,It is so hard to get through on the phone but once you are its fine and appointments are available.  The phone message is unneccessarily long but the waiting on the phone does seem to be reducing in length which is great.
Unity,Hate the appointments system!,2/5/2016,2,"I hate the appointments system, I can't seem to get an appointment for anything!"
Unity,Have to repeat yourself,12/11/2021,3,Using econsult for ongoing issues means that you have to repeat everything each time you need more help which is frustrating. I've also found that not seeing a doctor face to face has led to a much more drawn out process and delayed the diagnosis and therefore treatment. One face to face appointment would've been so much quicker than all the times I've needed to go back to the surgery.
Unity,Have to use econsult,5/27/2022,3,"Even when I've said I don't have online access and can't use econsult there is pressure applied to get a family member or friend to do it as that is the way to get appointments. I find this very upsetting when I need an appointment, I shouldn't have to ask people and tell them what is wrong with me if I need an appointment.  There's little flexibility, you're just expected to do what they want you to do.  Although I don't like the system I have so far been able to get appointments when I've needed them by having to rely on family. I've tried calling the surgery and they just say go online."
Unity,Have to wait,6/18/2016,1,Have to wait half an hor on the phone to get through and then cannot get in when you do get through
Unity,Have to wait a long time on phone,2/19/2020,4,"I find it difficult to get through you have to wait a long time to speak to anyone. 10 minutes does not seem long enough at times to spend with the doctor. It would be much better if access to the surgery could be improved, once you get here it is good service."
Unity,Hope for better things!,7/2/2019,5,I have noticed that the fan blades up here (first floor waiting room) are covered in dust and fluff-pretty dirty! It was our first visit last week (after registering here) and it didn't go so well. My partner was advised to buy some 'over the counter' medication and this hasn't worked and we are back today.
Unity,Horrendous,11/15/2019,1,Upon calling for an appointment the day before due to tonsillitis I ring back the next day at 8 spend 20 minutes in a que to then be spoken to rudely shouted at when I express frustration over there system told to find another surgery and refused to be given their name and told they are going to complain about myself
Unity,Horrendous,11/15/2019,1,Upon calling for an appointment the day before due to tonsillitis I ring back the next day at 8 spend 20 minutes in a que to then be spoken to rudely shouted at when I express frustration over there system told to find another surgery and refused to be given their name and told she is going to complain about myself.
Unity,I am unable to get through,2/12/2019,1,I am unable to get through on the phone and it is hard to get an appointment. They really need to get this sorted out. I have to wait a long time before I am called in to see the doctor too. Econsult has been explained to me so we will see what difference that makes.
Unity,I can't get an appointment,3/11/2018,2,It has been a long time since I have been because I can't get an appointment. That is why I have only filled in part of the scoring section
Unity,I did get an appointment this afternoon,10/22/2018,3,You have to ring dead on 8.00 (before that the system isn't open) or again dead on 1.00pm. Even doing that there is a queue (20 mins. for me today at 1.00pm) but I did get an appointment for this afternoon. The appointment system is the only thing i have an issue with. Doctors and nurses have been very good when I have seen them. They listen and then explain. So clinically it is good.
Unity,I did get an appointment today.,9/14/2018,4,Getting an appointment and being seen on time have always been an issue here. I did get an appointment today so that seems as if it might be a bit better. I don't know yet if I will be called in on time-we shall see!
Unity,I find Doctors & nurses to be kind,6/11/2018,4,"I come in here fairly regularly because I have an ongoing condition, I understand the system so I can make it work for me. I don't call on Mondays or Fridays to make my appointments because they are very busy days. I call on Tuesdays or Wednesdays at 1.00 pm. That usually works for me. I find the doctors and nurses to be kind, caring and thorough so overall it all works out very well."
Unity,I find the GP's to be very good,2/19/2020,4,"The staff are helpful on the phone but often difficult to get an appointment. Once I am at the surgery the GP's are very good. Receptionists are trying to help but they sound stressed and can be a bit abrupt in tone.The Paramedics are very good and the Nurse Practitioners also very good as is the Physio. The pharmacy fobbed me off recently I was waiting for a blood test results I was told me last Thursday that I would get them ""next Thursday"" but they are saying that they did not say next Thursday and I know they did that was frustrating."
Unity,I got an appointment today,9/15/2018,4,"I came in at 1.00pm and I got an appointment for this afternoon, which is great. Under the current appointment system (apparently) I shouldn't have come in in person but I should have 'phoned'. I was given an appointment because I didn't know-the test will be how things go next time using the new system!"
Unity,I have been a patient here for all of my life,6/11/2018,3,I have been a patient at this practice for all of my life. I have seen all of the changes over the years and I know it isn't the fault of reception staff or of the doctors but there aren't enough appointments. I am taking medication for depression (which is helping me) and this should have been my third month but the pharmacist told me that the tablets aren't on repeat so I couldn't get any. I was very anxious about this. I realise now (having seen the doctor) that I misunderstood things and now I am being supported to reduce medication and to use Wellbeing therapies.
Unity,I have been lucky,9/15/2018,5,Getting an appointment is moderately easy but I have been lucky. It is usually a long time on the 'phone waiting to speak. Releasing appointment twice a day doesn't seem enough to me.
Unity,I have had first class support,6/11/2018,5,I have had first class support through my pregnancy and now again with my three month old child. Very kind and caring staff all round
Unity,I have had to wait,9/14/2018,4,I have had to wait after the appointment time to see a clinician in the past. Getting an appointment is the hardest thing currently
Unity,I have to keep coming back to the GP,2/19/2020,3,"Consistency is not good for the same GP, I have been misdiagnosed a couple of times. I do not feel that they examine the patient well enough the first time they tend to give out medication or dismiss before they really know what it is, I think this is why people keep coming back time and time again with the same issue.If things were investigated more thoroughly to start with things would be much better in the long run."
Unity,I tried eConsult - good result,2/19/2020,5,"I tried to use eConsult today, I filled in the health questionnaire at 11am and the surgery sent me an email by 6pm with a number that I had to give to the surgery for an appointment, it seemed to go very well.I feel the surgery is improving."
Unity,I would like to see better communication,10/25/2019,3,The receptionists are lovely apart from one who is rude. I would like to see better communication especially when the medical staff are running late. I do feel that one of the female doctors saved by life 6 years ago.
Unity,I wouldn't change anything,1/11/2018,3,I rang today at 1.00 and I was number 9 in queue (lines open at 1.00) though it cleared quite quickly and I got this appointment. Other than the appointment system I wouldn't change anything. The practice is quite a short walk from my home so there aren't any transport issues for me.
Unity,If I could rate it a zero I would!,3/21/2019,1,"Rude receptionist, severe lack of appointments, had to call 36 times to sit in a queue for over an hour. Terrible."
Unity,Impossible,2/5/2016,1,it is impossible to get an appointment quickly
Unity,Impossible to get a GP appointment !,6/5/2021,1,Not possible to get GP appointment over the phone. Made appointments on line ( systmonline ) only to arrive at surgery to be told no appointment was made. Unity Healthcare website re-directs to old systmonline site which creates appointments that are denied at surgery. Absolute dismal service. HRT medication given without any blood pressure checks or consultation.
Unity,Impossible to get an appointment - even a phone call!,4/25/2017,1,"To whom it may concern.

I am a registered patient at the Christmas Maltings and Clements surgery, in Haverhill, Suffolk.

In the past, before the closure of the Crown Health Centre (a Darzi clinic), it was incredibly easy to get an appointment to see a real doctor about problems that were either low priority or not emergency, but needed a real doctor’s authorisation for tests.

I was, at the time, a registered patient of the Darzi clinic, and it was a very dark day when it was closed, and the monies were diverted away from Haverhill and to Bury St Edmunds (and out of General Practise).

Subsequently, and because it was within walking distance of home, I registered at the Christmas Maltings and Clements surgery.

While I have been given a GP, I do not recall his/her name, nor do I believe I have ever met my GP!

Now to the crux of the matter.  While it is true that I have been put off communicating with my Doctor, I could in the past always rely on a phone call for a quick chat, if I felt something needed to be discussed.  I could always rely that if I called in the morning, I could get a phone call for a non-emergency query.

At least, until today.

I called, in the hope of getting an appointment either for an evening or Saturday timeslot.

I was advised that they are now fully booked, and that on the 2nd of May new appointments will be released at 8am, which will be booked before 8:30 for the next month.

In other words… If you think you’ll get an evening or weekend appointment with a doctor, you must be joking!

As for phone calls.

Well, unless it’s an emergency, the soonest a doctor could call me for a non-emergency routine telephone call would be May 14th!

I was, needless to say, flabbergasted!

I was invited to partake of the walk in clinic at either 8am or 2pm, but on the understanding that places are limited, and that the wait may be up to 4 hours.

Not only that, but I may not actually get to see a doctor, but rather a nurse practitioner or locum.

While that would suit for most things, I saw a nurse practitioner just 2 weeks ago, and she was not able to procure any treatment or blood test, without me consulting a doctor, and therefore advised me to book another appointment, despite having waited nearly 2 hours that afternoon!

I am honestly disgusted at the state of GP in Haverhill.  We are a growing community, with the new innovation park and all of the new housing.  Yet, we have only 2 GP surgeries responsible for Haverhill and the surrounding villages.

One of the GP practises is in Special Measures, and the other (my surgery) is obviously over subscribed!

Now I understand why so many people go to A&E for minor complaints, since the GP system in Haverhill is lacking."
Unity,Information not up to date,12/10/2022,3,"Having regular blood tests is fine, its all well organised and easy to arrange but for ad hoc issues its more difficult as most is done via econsult with no telephone consultations. Econsult as a system does work well for me to contact the surgery and because I work and they do respond. However, the responses are often very brief and do not always address all the issues or aspects covered in the initial contact.  You then have to do another econsult for follow up information or need to try and speak to someone. Its frustrating having to repeat all the information already submitted because it hasn't been addressed in the first contact. At least when you talk to a clinician you can ask follow up questions or seek clarification easily, econsult does not allow for this.  I've asked for my medication to be changed so the prescription is correct but this still hasn't been done after asking a number of times, it just becomes a hassle to deal with it. Long term conditions support is lacking Information from the hospital doesn't get on the system quickly enough so medication changes are not acted upon, I  now have to print a copy of letters myself and bring them in because that is the quickest way to get medication changed.  They must have the consultants letter they just haven't managed to get it on the system.  We've also had issues where the surgery and hospital were arguing who should be prescribing the medication that was needed meaning that it couldn't be prescribed.  Communication is one of the biggest issues at the surgery."
Unity,It can take a long time to get through,10/25/2019,4,"It can take a long time for the phone to be answered sometimes 20 mins, this can be frustrating. I would like more consistency with the same GP. The staff on reception are friendly. I did have to come back 3 times before I got a diagnosis about my lung condition."
Unity,It has all been excellent,6/11/2018,5,I am reasonably healthy so I don't come here very often.I was unwell yesterday and phoned in and I spoke with  doctor. I followed their advice and started my treatment yesterday as advised. I was asked to come in today and so for me it has been excellent all round. I now have a care plan (agreed with the GP). Going forward I have great confidence in my doctor and I don't think I could have had better care anywhere.
Unity,It has worked well.,10/22/2018,4,"I am reasonably fit and so I don't need to come here very often, which I am pleased about. So far it has all worked well for this visit. I 'phoned today and got an appointment this afternoon so I would have to say that is good!"
Unity,It's not too bad here,2/12/2019,4,"It's not too bad here, it is a bit difficult to get through and when I do get through there is often no appointments available for that day. I would like to be able to book ahead, but unfortunately its only on the day only appointments."
Unity,It's ok if surgery contacts you,7/2/2019,2,"Main problem for me is getting an appointment-there are no routine ones so it is all on the day. It's ok if the surgery contact you to come in for a review etc. as an appointment comes with the invite. Also, I think 10 minutes if not long enough for the proper explanation of complex symptoms."
Unity,It's wonderful once you get an appointment,10/25/2019,4,"To get an appointment it is very difficult, but if you get the appointment its wonderful here."
Unity,Local services are needed,3/12/2018,3,Dietitian-we need local appointments. GP's don't know local information because they are forever changing due to shortages. Local services are needed.
Unity,Loosing registration form for new resident,9/25/2018,1,"Resident '*' was admitted to Cleves Place Care home August 2018. They registered '*' with this surgery and left the appropriate paperwork.  A few days later when contacting the surgery they informed us that the resident was not registered with them.  The paperwork had been lost by reception.
The surgery is also very frequently not delivering on their promises. Many times a GP comes out to see patients in the care home when they will say that they will prescribe something, it is not done and the home later has to ask for the same patient to be seen again fro the same reason."
Unity,Mainly ok,5/27/2022,4,"It's mainly ok but I feel it's time things like appointments should return to normal and there should be freer access to in person appointments.  The care provided by the doctors and nurses is excellent and I really can't fault it, I would just like to be able to see a GP rather than go through a triage process or econsult.  Econsult  will often advise you to stop the submission and either call the surgery or go to A&E which isn't necessary."
Unity,Managed to fit me in and sort me out,1/11/2018,4,"I have been a patient here for about 11 years. Of the various systems over that time the GP call back triage system worked best for me. Telephone only works less well. I called everyday one week and didn't get an appointment. Today (Weds) was my third try (this week) but I am here! Blood tests are Sudbury, Bury or Newmarket, very difficult if you can't drive. Once, I had an asthma attack and I struggled with the appointments system but they did manage to fit me in and sort me out."
Unity,Mental health support slow,5/27/2022,3,"Getting mental health support for a child has been slow and difficult, it took the police to get involved before anything really happened. So frustrating."
Unity,much better than a year ago,7/2/2019,4,"It isn't perfect but this surgery is now functioning so much better than a year or so ago. there is now a system and if you know and understand it, it works. I don't know how well it would work for soemone who hasn't used it before. The GP Plus service sounds great. Currently I have to book a half day off work to make an appointment-Saturday would work so much better for me."
Unity,Multiple econsults,12/10/2022,3,I've submitted 3 econsults for multiple issues but none have been responded to including one about a heart issue. I was trying to discuss issues around a pulse being 190. In the end I saw a nurse who arranged an appointment for me. On the morning of the appointment I had a high pulse again and the surgery called an ambulance for me.  It just seems like they are really struggling at the moment.  Staff are polite  and friendly but they don't seem to have the time they need as a hospital letter about a medication change hasn't been added to my file so I haven't been able to have the new medication. I've just brought my copy in so it can be added and I can get the medication.
Unity,My consultations have been very good,7/2/2019,3,I have scored 'attitude' as a 5 star but some of the doctors I have seen would be a 1 in my opinion. Nurses are more timely than doctors. Most of consultations have been very good but sometimes I feel we haven't had time to get down to the real issue. Also I can't see the same doctor twice so there is no continuity of care. Some days it is difficult to get onto telephone queue but when you do get on you are pretty much sure to get an appointment.
Unity,Never any issues,3/14/2023,4,"I pre booked today's appointment with a nurse for my blood test by phone which was easy to do and I've never had any issues getting an appointment.  Contact is more limited now but staff are friendly and they know me well. I don't feel there is anything that they need to improve, it all works well."
Unity,No continuity of Care,5/3/2019,1,"Appointment system is incompatible with full time work - both telephoning for an appointment (which has to be at 08:00 - when one is driving to work) and attending an appointment. You can only get same a day appointment, so you have to take a day off work in advance because you have no idea (until 08:00 or 13:00 on the same day) what time your appointment will be. Then if you are unlucky, you will be told that in fact there are no appointments that day and you will have to phone back tomorrow! 
For routine appointments for an ongoing condition it would be useful to be able to book an appointment 2 weeks ahead (for example), so that you can plan and juggle work/life/commitments. 
Seeing the same doctor for ongoing investigations into a chronic condition would be reassuring and sensible. You never see the same doctor twice at this surgery."
Unity,No issues,11/11/2021,5,Staff have been good. I've been a few times lately for appointments and its all worked fine. I tend to call to try and get an appointment and have not struggled to talk with a doctor when needed.
Unity,No issues getting an appointment,5/27/2022,4,"I've had no issues getting an appointment today, I called wanting to speak to a nurse but was told I had to have a GP call back. After the call back they arranged for me to come in for the appointment.  The care provided is good but at times reception staff can be a little unfriendly. We're told to be polite to them but it should work both ways.  I would prefer to have easier access to face to face appointments rather than going through the triage process. When I called the other day I seemed to have difficulties with the phone options as I ended up somewhere other than the department I was hoping for."
Unity,No problems at all,11/11/2021,5,I don't have any problems getting an appointment when I need one. Generally I call the surgery for appointments and this works well and I feel I'm getting all the support I need from staff too.
Unity,No real care offered - only frustration,2/19/2019,1,Way too many instances of poor experiences at this surgery to detail
Unity,No respect towards people who needs care,2/22/2019,1,I called Gp explaining situation about my 2 years old daughter who has chest infection. Lady on the phone was rude didn't listen and worse she put phone down.
Unity,not able to get an appointment,1/18/2019,1,"appointments through phone only but cannot get through on phone as line is always to busy to get through ,as told only will be given out at 8 am and 1 pm, so everyone phones at them two times,  get told cannot ask for appointment at desk, why not? Why don't they put appointments online? They used to this would make life a lot easier for everyone"
Unity,Not good,2/5/2016,1,it's not good. Have to wait half an hour on the phone and then you can't get an appointment when you do get through
Unity,Nurses are on time,10/22/2018,1,"Nurses usually are on time, the doctors less so. There has been a lot of changes over the last year to 18 months and the end result is that I never (currently) see the same doctor twice. It feels to me as if there is a real lack of experience now. There aren't the older doctors in the practice to train and bed in the newer ones."
Unity,On my last 3 e consult I have only had emails,1/17/2022,3,"Contacted doctors several times in last 2 months more than I ever have before. Believe this is because no phone calls or appointments. Spent huge amount of money on prescriptions, had to work out that my illness was caused by drug I started taking. Even after complaining of chest pain no phone call or appointment. Had to work out my self it was caused by hrt."
Unity,One of the doctors here is one in a million,10/25/2019,4,"Some staff are very good but unfortunately one lady has an attitude, also one of the doctors has a rude attitude. But there is one doctor here who has an Irish accent I think, who is excellent, I would say he is one in a million."
Unity,Others are good,10/22/2018,4,"There is one doctor that I am not that keen on so when I visit I see one of the others or sometimes the nurse. I have found them all to be good-polite and clear in their explanations. I have been a patient here most of my life. Years ago you had one particular doctor that you always saw. Now, even if you have an ongoing chronic condition you never seem to see the same doctor twice and i miss that continuity. This new surgery is big and bright and clean but it isn't as good for me as I can't walk up here due to my asthma. I could walk to the old surgery but now I have to get a taxi."
Unity,Otherwise-everything is very good.,9/15/2018,4,I've always managed to get an appointment ok on the 'phone. Friends and family have struggled more. Otherwise I think everything is very good
Unity,Overall I'm fairly happy here,9/14/2018,4,"Overall I'm fairly happy here. I rang in this morning and I have got an appointment on the day. There is, however, a bit of an issue about the time it takes on the 'phone."
Unity,Paramedic on duty I found to be rubbish,2/12/2019,3,"I came to see the staff paramedic I found them to be rubbish. Said that I had to go to A & E at Bury, when I got there the triage nurse said how surprised she was that they could not help me at the surgery with my injury, skin injury on shin."
Unity,Poor,12/14/2016,1,Practice and GPs are not very reliable in regards to prescribing and reviewing medication and results
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,2,It .  Reception staff can be quite rudeis impossible to get an appointment when one is required.  Can be on phone in queue for 1/2 hour and then be told no appointments available
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,2,"To go for an appointment you have to predict that you are going to be poorly in like 3 weeks time as that the next available appointment, or sit and wait for 4 -5 hours as and when you go to your appointment.  No one informs you  if the GPs are running 2 hours late or they have gone home.  The receptionists are lovely but the GPs are rude and unprofessional."
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,2,appointment system nonexistent
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,2,Hate the appointment system! Can't get appointments for anything
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,1,Impossible to get appointment quickly
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,1,"It is appalling to ring at 8 am to get an appointment and you have to be lucky within the first 2 minutes to get one, otherwise they are all gone."
Unity,poor,9/30/2019,1,"They say they have taken on 4 new doctors but they do not seem to be full time.  You cannot get an appointment very easily, it is very hard.  If you walk in you have to sit and wait 3-4 hours, a long time"
Unity,Poor communication,8/23/2018,1,This feedback concerns my adult daughter but I was involved. There was poor communication with GP practice and a duty on call GP. Was dismissive and did not return a call when promised. The incident then required an emergency admission to hospital via A&E as no support was provided.
Unity,Prefer to talk to people in person,11/11/2021,3,First time in 2 years I've seen someone. I don't like talking to people on the phone and would rather see a doctor face to face. I've been in today for a health check and now have appointments arranged for a number of additional checks that need to be done.
Unity,Pretty good,3/13/2023,5,"Appointments are available and I've found econsult has worked too.  I do struggle to get across how things are impacting me when I do an econsult so I'm not really sure how the doctors can really understand. It has improved and generally works well, the staff are great to talk issues through with and they explain things well."
Unity,Pretty good,3/13/2023,4,"It's a pretty good surgery and they are doing well. I have found that econsult can be more drawn out as you have to wait for the reply and if you have any follow up questions you have to start a new submission and can't just reply to the doctor which is frustrating.  I have amended the answers I've given to allow the form to be submitted too, otherwise the system does tell you to call the surgery.  Once through it's all very good but getting through to the surgery is the issue.   My son started experiencing problems nearly a year ago but all contact until today has been via econsult and he's had no face to face appointment. It's an ongoing situation which isn't improving but is impacting his education."
Unity,Pretty good surgery,5/30/2022,4,Its a pretty good surgery as I've been able to get appointments whenever I've needed them. I called the surgery the last last time I needed to be seen and then spoke to a GP and they then arranged for me to come in to the surgery the next morning. The care provided by the GP I saw was all good so I'm happy with the surgery.
Unity,Prior warning would be nice,12/1/2017,4,I would prefer to always be warned when needles come in contact
Unity,Realise face to face isn't always needed,5/27/2022,4,It works well when you call for an appointment. You get to talk to the GP to sort things out which is great but it would be nicer to have a face to face appointment as it is sometimes easier to discuss things in person than over the phone but I realise that it's not always needed.
Unity,Reception staff sometimes seem 'odd',9/14/2018,1,Reception staff can sometimes seem 'odd'. I wonder if they get consistent training as they all seem to work differently. They seem defensive from the start of the communication but once you get through that they are fine.
Unity,Receptionists can be abrupt,3/12/2018,3,"The receptionists can be a bit abrupt at times. I find that the doctors are variable, some very good some less so."
Unity,Refused to register a temporary patient,2/22/2021,1,"I have my father with me for 6 weeks who is 65 and suffers with some health issues, he usually resides in Ireland and I know legislation allows him to see a GP and the surgery refused and said ""try someone else"""
Unity,Satisfied overall,10/25/2019,5,"The doctors do vary, I usually have to wait 5-10 mins before the phone is answered. Overall though I am satisfied with this surgery."
Unity,Service poor,2/18/2019,2,Has been going down and down over the years. Nurses very good but it is difficult to get in to see a regular doctor. Not much follow up done.
Unity,Some improvements noted,10/25/2019,4,"Some improvements on the appointments noted, overall pretty good really."
Unity,Staff are great,12/11/2021,4,"I'd rather talk to someone than use the online system, however on the whole it has worked but I would still prefer to see someone. Once you do get through to talk to someone the staff are great and get things sorted."
Unity,Staff are very helpful,10/25/2019,2,"It is easier to get an appointment with the nurse rather than the doctor. I think the system would be better if you could book appointments ahead, its not always useful to have on the day appointments.The staff are very helpful."
Unity,Staff are very nice,10/25/2019,3,"Its difficult to get an appointment but once you do get through the staff are very nice, you can't fault them. You do have to wait quite a while sometimes before you get called into the surgery, improved communication around this would be good."
Unity,Staff professional and helpful,2/12/2019,4,"On the whole I am fine with getting appointments here, I know my friends tell me that they have difficulties here but it is ok for me and my son. I find staff to be professional and helpful. A small children's play area would be nice. I do find waiting on the phone too long to get an appointment."
Unity,surgery initiated appointments work fine.,7/2/2019,3,It is difficult to get an appointment if you work. I work in a school and can't make/take telephone calls. Now I know about GP Plus things should be easier though. This appointment (for my son) was easier because it was initiated by the surgery so no problems there. I do miss having my own GP though.
Unity,They did book me in,9/15/2018,3,Getting an appointment. It is awkward for me because I work. I called at 2.15 yesterday and was told I was too late as all appointments had gone. I called in (a personal visit) this afternoon and I was told I couldn't book face to face. I had taken the afternoon off work to see a doctor and the receptionist made an exception and booked me in. So it has turned out ok this time but it doesn't look good going forward.
Unity,This time has been spot on!,9/14/2018,4,Getting an appointment can sometimes be difficult-I have waited up to three weeks in the past. This time it has been spot on other than I was 19th in the queue and had to wait for an hour on the 'phone. That's not good because I have to pay for calls on my bill.
Unity,Too many patients,1/11/2018,3,Some doctors explain things better than others but because of the appointments system you can't choose which doctor you get to see. This isn't a typical appointment for me. Addenbrookes hospital emailed the practice and we got an appointment from the secretary rather than from reception. I don't think the practice is as good as it used to be-too many patients.
Unity,Unable to book appointments,1/25/2019,1,"Despite phoning 8am every morning, unable to book appointments, or even get in the queue! Unable to speak to Doctors. Unable to get repeat prescriptions. Under staffed and not fit for purpose. Running out of tablets - which I have been trying to sort for weeks!"
Unity,Unable to get non urgent appointment,6/2/2019,1,"Pathetic system. Work 20 miles from practice. Have to ring on the day for an appointment, (non urgent so taking someones needed one IF get through) impossible for me, can't even book annual leave to see a go as no non urgent appointments. No wonder A&E always full.  Abysmal."
Unity,Unhappy about the closure,11/11/2021,4,No Issues really other than the closure of the Steeple Bumpstead surgery. I can't understand how suddenly it's not viable to run. Getting to and from Haverhill is difficult if you do not have access to a car as there are limited other options. Staff though are great when you do see them it's just not as convenient having to come in to Haverhill.
Unity,Unnecessary questions,5/26/2022,3,"The online access to the surgery asks very unnecessary questions including ones about gambling. It's difficult to get a face to face appointment, I've had  tonsillitis multiple times but couldn't get seen. I've also had to send photos through the system, been given antibiotics had to do the whole process again when the antibiotics didn't work and was then sent to A&E when finally seen.  The staff are amazing when you do see them it's just getting to see them in the first place.  When econsult red flagged my entry and told me to call the surgery as I needed more urgent help I followed the advice only to be told by reception to change the answer so that I could complete a submission, how is this right?"
Unity,v poor,6/21/2016,1,"Can't get an appointment,  can never get through on phone - 1.5 hours on phone - could not get through. No appointment available on website."
Unity,Very good,11/11/2021,5,"It's a very good surgery, works well and I got through really quickly this morning, although it can normally take more time. Staff explain things really well and the nurse I see is nice and friendly."
Unity,Very happy with surgery,5/27/2022,4,Getting my blood tests when they are needed has been fine but I have noticed that it's a little easier now than it was. The doctors always give very good care and advice when I do have appointments with them. I mainly have blood test and don't need regular appointments with a doctor.
Unity,Very helpful receptionist.,5/2/2019,5,Good clear advice offered. Appointment made. Fortunately I don’t need to use the services of the practice very often but have always had a positive experience. Today has been no exception.
Unity,Very little reassurance,9/14/2018,1,"Reception staff attitude can be poor sometimes and I am always late being called in to my appointment. Sometimes this happens first thing in the morning so I don't understand how they can be late. I have had cancer which is now in remission. not long ago I had a painful shoulder and I saw a doctor who asked me to have a blood test. This was carried out but I was then asked by letter to return for a second blood test two weeks later. This was duly carried out. I subsequently received a letter asking me to come back for a third blood test which is in two weeks time. The letters lacked clinical information and offered very little reassurance given my history with cancer. Separately from this I have an injection every 28 days, I have been told that this can happen a day early or a day late but no more than that. I had an appointment for this injection on Monday which the surgery cancelled as the nurse was ill (I understand that these things happen). I wasn't offered an alternative appointment but told to ring in as there was nothing until 13/9 (10 days late). The clinicians all seem to be pretty good but the admin/organisation/systems are very poor."
Unity,Very poor,3/10/2017,1,Very poor. Had to wait an hour to get through to a receptionist to enquire whether I was having a doctor come out to see my residents
Unity,Very poor,6/14/2021,1,"Very poor service. Unable to get appointments. They make you sit and wait to see a doctor which can take up to 3-4 hours. Doctors do not listen, will only give you basic treatment, anything too complicated they dissmiss. My farther who is 85 had to go to hospital because the surgery did not listen to his carer and miss diagnosed him. Was not interested in his care. Staff will determine if you are ill enough to see a doctor and can be very rude. Not acceptable."
Unity,Waited for 3 days to get an appointment,2/12/2019,3,I have tried for 3 days to get through to make an appointment and today I finally got through. I contacted 111 service last night as I felt so unwell. If the appointments and access was improved it would improve things so much.
Unity,Waiting 8 days to be seen is too long,2/19/2020,3,"eConsult is easy to fill in but I think having to wait 8 days to be seen with my issue is too long. Overall from past experience it is an amazing experience here, it is a good surgery."
Unity,Waiting on the phone is very difficult,2/12/2019,3,Waiting on the phone is very difficult. Staff attitude showed some lack of respect when asked can she help me to get an appointment. The medical staff are very good here though.
Unity,Waiting too long for a doctor appointment oth,6/10/2015,1,Have to wait 4 weeks to see my own GP
Unity,Well supported,12/11/2021,5,"I've been well supported throughout. Econsult works well for me as I can do it around work and its much better than spending ages on the phone waiting to talk to reception. Staff are really great too however, econsult does make it so you have less contact with them but it also means it is less stressful too."
Unity,WHY CAN I JUST SEE AND TALK TO A DOCTOR?,1/13/2020,1,"I wish to see a doctor about a long time problem with my knees, with the sometimes unbearable pain I get. (no need for an emergency appoint) and have been refused as the say a physiotherapist is all they will offer?

Is this acceptable?"
Unity,Works ok,1/11/2018,5,My mum needs bloods every two weeks due to medication issues. That works ok because the nurses make the appointment for the next time while she is in with them. But at a GP appointment she needed a blood test in addition to the routine ones. It couldn't be done at the surgery for three weeks. So she went to Addenbrookes but she was still waiting for the results to arrive five weeks later. During that time she had an appointment with a consultant at Addenbrookes and he was able to access the results there and reassure her that everything was ok.
Unity,Works well for us,1/11/2018,4,"We have been coming to this surgery as a family for many years. Things were very difficult here a couple of years or so ago, it became very difficult to get in to see a doctor. There have been various changes to how you can book and now it is only by 'phone. This works well for us as I don't work and can call in on behalf of all members of the family-my husband, son and daughter. I avoid 8.00 as it is very busy, I try at 1.00. We don't have to use the system that often but it works ok for us. No complaints at all about the quality of the doctors-first class. receptionists always seem friendly and efficient."
Unity,Your GPs don’t care,1/19/2022,2,"Generic I get an okay experience but the last experience one of your GPs couldn’t be bothered to pick up the phone for 5 mins after I stated I was depressed, not in a good way and suicidal whilst being in my second trimester of pregnancy, the GP sent an email telling me to get fresh air and spend time with friends? Not even knowing my situation? And we wonder why mental health is at its prime."
Victoria  ,A bit of a wait,12/12/2022,3,I've had a two week wait to get an appointment and I feel it is more urgent than that.
Victoria  ,A good surgery,7/3/2019,4,"I did find the process of getting a face to face appointment with a GP during the pandemic difficult but luckily I've not needed them much since. I did like the online system when I used it, I had to get used to it but it worked well."
Victoria  ,Absolutely fine,3/13/2023,5,"An efficient surgery where you can quickly get appointments or a call back, whichever is most appropriate. The staff listen and the call backs get most issues dealt with over the phone without the need to come to the surgery. When calling the surgery I've got through quickly and I'm happy to be led by reception on who is best to see for certain issues."
Victoria  ,All been good,2/24/2022,4,"It's fairly much back to how it was, you talk to reception staff and are offered an appointment. Staff are good at responding and getting back to you. The online systems including econsult have worked well with quick responses. The doctors and nurses explaining issues very well and don't mind questions being asked."
Victoria  ,All staff have been excellent here,12/3/2020,5,"I have to say that they are all wonderful to me here, especially the dispensary staff. The reception staff are good on the phone and also face to face, they are so helpful. I have found the doctors and nurses to be very professional but human, they listen well but you can also have a laugh with them sometimes too. It is easy to get an appointment when I need one, just carry on doing what you are doing."
Victoria  ,All ways good service from all staff,6/4/2023,5,"All my contact with Victoria surgery has been excellent. Helpful reception staff, thorough GPS and nurses. I always feel listened to and cared for. Thank you"
Victoria  ,Always been able to be seen,10/25/2021,5,"Its pretty good, I'm not worried about getting appointments as I've always been seen when needed. My GP isn't always available but I understand that and am happy to see the others. It all works well and I've been happy with it all including the online services which I find easier than the phone at times."
Victoria  ,Always helpful,1/12/2020,5,"Best doctors practise in Bury St Edmunds, reception staff are polite, organised, and efficient."
Victoria  ,Always in a rush to get you out,8/9/2016,3,Always in a rush to get you out - you feel you're not listened to/understood
Victoria  ,Always very helpful,7/2/2015,5,"The response when you ring is very quick, the receptionists  are always very caring and helpful  and the doctors  are always very understanding ,we are very pleased to be at this surgery"
Victoria  ,Always very helpful positive and supportive.,8/17/2020,5,Always give the impression that nothing is too much trouble even when it really is not easy to resolve.
Victoria  ,Any little niggles get rectified quickly,10/23/2019,4,"I am happy with the surgery and any little niggles that might happen get rectified quickly. I do find the answerphone message wastes a lot of time, its an absolute nuisance actually, I just wish I could phone up and for it to be answered by the receptionist. The doctors and nurses are very good here, I do not have any complaints at all and I really do feel they will do their best to get you in if they can, they often go the extra mile for me."
Victoria  ,Appointment was available for next day,5/9/2018,5,I had a cough/bad chest which I went to see the pharmacist about (following NHS advice) and I took the medication that I was provided for seven weeks and the day I ran out the symptoms returned. I called the surgery for an appointment and they said they could see me the next day which I thought was very good. I didn't ask for an emergency appt. as I had had the condition for some time so 24 hours was fantastic! Dr examined me and prescribed antibiotics and I was soon well again.
Victoria  ,appointments,3/13/2023,4,It's been absolutely fine to get an appointment for the kids but for us its been more difficult to get seen. Its made more difficult that my partner works away and can't get back quickly to attend short notice appointments but the system in place doesn't make it easy to arrange appointments in advance.  The appointments are running 45 mins behind today which is difficult with 2 small children but I get that something has probably happened.
Victoria  ,"Been a patient for 38 years, NEVER had a bant",3/22/2020,5,"Over time, I have seen several different doctors and nurses, All including the receptionists, are without exception knowledgeable, caring and fantastically helpful. You never feel rushed, or trying to get yopu out in a hurry. Hopefully, all practices should be like this. If not, they should."
Victoria  ,Been difficult,10/25/2021,3,I've found it difficult to get an appointment when needed. I thought I needed to be seen but getting a face to face with a doctor was difficult.
Victoria  ,Been seen face to face,10/25/2021,4,"I haven't  had my diabetic checks as regularly as I would normally have but I wanted to see the doctor face to face today and have been given an appointment which is great, it is more difficult than it used to be though."
Victoria  ,Booking appointments in advance,4/8/2015,5,I like the fact that you can book appointments in advance.
Victoria  ,Brilliant,9/13/2022,5,"Called this morning and spoke to reception who were very good. I explained why I was calling and that I had tried other things  that had not worked including physio. They then made an appointment for me to see a doctor and I feel I saw the most appropriate person for the issue, it worked really well and staff are great."
Victoria  ,Brilliant All the Way Through!,12/3/2020,5,"Its brilliant all the way through ! The practice nurse always explains things well to me. I am very very pleased with this surgery, no improvements needed."
Victoria  ,Brilliant surgery,6/3/2023,5,"Its an efficient and friendly surgery where staff do all they can to help. I've had fantastic care from very thorough doctors but wanting to see the same GP can mean delays when being seen.  The social prescriber here is very good too, very supportive."
Victoria  ,Brilliant Surgery,10/18/2022,5,"Receptionists are nice and friendly and everything is done very well. I was invited in for my health check today so getting the appointment was no trouble. I mainly see my own doctor and they are marvellous and so supportive and I'm happy to wait a bit longer just to see them. I can't fault the surgery, I've been here a long time and I've never had any issues."
Victoria  ,Called to see Dr. Very helpful,7/22/2021,5,"Support was 100%, quick and professional."
Victoria  ,Can not change a password,7/20/2022,1,"I have explained to the staff at the surgery that the website will not recognise my email, so each time it tells me to change my password I can not. I have tried everything and can no longer have access to my own details because no one is willing to help!!"
Victoria  ,Can see doctor more easily now,10/25/2021,4,I like that I can see a doctor in person more easily now. At the height of covid it was more difficult and I found it much more challenging to discuss things on the phone.
Victoria  ,Can take time for a phone consultation,10/18/2022,4,"To book a telephone appointment with a GP can be quite a long wait, on some occassions it has taken over two weeks. Staff mostly are pleasant and have a nice manner but one receptionist can be a little brusque."
Victoria  ,Can't praise enough,10/18/2022,5,"It's a brilliant surgery I can't praise it enough. They are quick to answer the phone and for call backs and they get things sorted. The care provided over the last 10 months has been very good, I'm very grateful."
Victoria  ,Care has been great,10/25/2021,4,Was seen straight away with a young child but do feel there could be a bit more flexibility with afternoon appointments as you have to call back after 12.00 to try and get one if all the morning appointments are gone which can be frustrating.
Victoria  ,Careless/uncaring,1/13/2023,2,"Went to A&E because unable to access doctor. Follow up phone call, with doctor I've never met who did not phone at arranged time and was very offhand. When phoned for test results told brusquely ""no further action"". First time I have requested an appointment in 6 years. Thoroughly disgusted. Found alternative help."
Victoria  ,Children seen quickly,6/28/2022,4,"Never had any issues getting the children seen. After talking to the receptionist this morning we were invited in for an appointment and saw a great clinician, so very happy with the care and support. It can be difficult getting a double buggy through some of the doors, you just have to giggle it a bit!"
Victoria  ,Concerns were dismissed,6/13/2016,2,For years my husband saw the same GP. We raised concerns about his shaking hand but were told it was due to the medication he was taking. Finally we'd had enough so booked to see another doctor who very quickly said he thought he had Parkinsons and referred him to hospital. The consultant diagnosed Parkinsons and another condition.
Victoria  ,Consistent high standard of care,10/14/2021,5,"The reception staff are always polite and helpful. Without exception the doctors are caring, good listeners and helpful. They always explain their findings, recommendations and refer on when needed.
Follow up for long term conditions,  reminders for health checks and vaccinations is excellent.
All this despite the current pressures caused by the covid pandemic. Amazing care"
Victoria  ,Could not ask for more.,4/28/2023,5,Called at 8am.  Seen and filled prescription by 9.40 am. I'm not sure what more people can ask for.
Victoria  ,Couldn't ask for better,2/24/2022,5,"It's been very good to get appointments with the nurses, usually only a days wait to be seen. I couldn't ask for better with understanding, caring and professional nurses who have been great. I do my prescriptions online and that works well, the only thing that could be better is a bigger car park but given the location that's unlikely to happen."
Victoria  ,Covid 19 Vaccination Clinic,3/20/2021,5,A friendly and efficient vaccination system at Victoria Surgery. Walked in and was seen immediately for my jab today.  Thank to everyone involved.
Victoria  ,Difficult attitude from a doctor,10/23/2019,3,"I feel that the nurses here work very well, sadly I did experience one difficult attitude from one of the doctors, she said to me ""what do you expect me to do""."
Victoria  ,Disgustingly dismissive!,10/2/2023,1,"My mother went to pick up a prescription this morning, both Heart Medication and Blood Pressure Tablets. Due to a glitch in the system, the Blood Presssure Tablets weren't correctly ordered in (Despite having been ordered a week ago today), so told her to go home and come back at 4pm today as they needed to get them signed off. The external pharmacy were lovely people throughout the interaction.

Due to 4pm being school pick-up hours, I (her daughter) was the one to return to pick the tablets up, only to find they STILL were not in! Now, i'm not putting blame on the external pharmacy, they were and are lovely, polite people who did what they could for my mother. I was told to chase it up inside the doctors at the dispensary and I was disgusted by how dismissive they were about their mistake!

The woman there had the audacity to tell ME off for chasing up an important prescription, after being the ones to tell us to come back at 4pm to pick them up. We were not told to call back like she claimed that must be the case nor were we told that it could take up to 72hrs! I have never felt so brushed aside by someone who is meant to be there to help and it's utterly disgusting that someone like her was hired, even if she was having a bad day (As we were informed we weren't the first people their systems glitched on) that is NO excuse to be dismissive of someone looking for answers!"
Victoria  ,Doctors and nurses explain things well,10/23/2019,4,"The doctors and nurses explain things well. Getting an appointment can be frustrating, I often wait for about 10 mins before the phone is answered. For a general appointment you do have to wait up to 2 weeks but if you really need one on the day you can get it."
Victoria  ,Doctors are helpful and booking is very easy,3/10/2022,5,"Got an appointment very quickly, 10/10"
Victoria  ,"Doctors are very kind, caring and thorough",10/23/2019,5,"All of the doctors are very kind and caring and thorough. The staff are excellent, I would dread it having to move to another surgery. But you do have to wait up to 2 weeks for a regular appointment."
Victoria  ,dp - good,7/5/2016,4,"As my GP may not be available, I'll see others in the practice.  They may not be mental health orientate, ie. Lithium tabs."
Victoria  ,Dr was very caring and very thorough!,10/2/2021,5,"I rang the surgery and a lovely receptionist took details and told me a doctor would ring in the afternoon. 	Dr rang me and after a discussion I was told to bring my daughter to the surgery within 15 minutes. The doctor was unable to identify what was wrong with my daughters eye as she was in severe pain and unable to open it. Dr was so caring and gentle at all times and asked me to wait whilst they rang the hospital. My daughter was given an appointment at the hospital within 1.5 hrs and was seen by amazing doctors and nurses who were able to open the eye with an anaesthetic eye drop and diagnose the problem causing the pain, give appropriate prescriptions and offer a follow up appointment a few days later. Dr was outstanding and I knew they wanted to ensure daughter was treated and not left as she was. Their kindness and genuine care for my daughter really stood out which is why I wanted to leave this review."
Victoria  ,Dr's and nurses are great,10/25/2021,4,"The flu and covid vaccination programmes run by the surgery were brilliant, both went so smoothly. I have found that messages from the hospital do not always reach the doctors and this makes me feel a little anxious as it keeps happening. It worries me that if I'm not copied in to the letters I will not know what I need the doctors to be aware of."
Victoria  ,Drs and nurses do a good job,2/25/2022,5,"Never had any real issues getting appointments.  The phone consultations are great and should remain as the first option when you need to contact the surgery, they have always led to a face to face appointment when its been needed. I'm really happy it all works so well. Econsult has also worked very well to get advice and treatment."
Victoria  ,Drs explain well,3/13/2023,5,"Urgent issues are seen and dealt with on the day. We've been here a lot lately with the children but have always got appointments whenever they've been needed. The doctors explain issues well and we've had good consistency too.  I've used a mix of phone and online contact depending on the issues, I've found the online option works really well and don't feel that anything could be better here."
Victoria  ,Easy to make appointments,10/18/2022,4,"I find the staff pleasant and it's been easy to make appointments when I've needed them, either after talking to a GP or direct with reception."
Victoria  ,Econsult works well,2/25/2022,4,"I've been able to get appointments when they are needed and econsult has worked well at addressing the issues, calling reception means you can get appointments quickly too.  Staff are are generally very good, at times it can be a little mixed depending who you see but most the time they are very good."
Victoria  ,excellent,10/10/2016,5,Fantastic.  All my medical needs have been well looked after for over 50 years.  Same day appointments.  Maybe too much! more co-ordination  possibly?
Victoria  ,Excellent,3/23/2016,4,Reception staff are excellent but I would like to be able to see the same doctor more often.
Victoria  ,Excellent care during a very difficult time .,11/29/2022,5,Excellent care in a health service that is underfunded and always has been..
Victoria  ,Excellent GPs and Nurses,8/1/2021,5,They have always taken time to explain things to me. I always feel valued.
Victoria  ,Excellent medical staff,10/23/2019,4,"The dispensary is good and the doctors are good quality. The surgery waiting area always seems cold. The front desk staff could be a little more friendly on one occasion I felt that the person who answered the phone spoke to me as though I had got dementia, I only asked her if she could repeat what she had said. But the medical staff from my experience is excellent, I wish I could see the same doctor every time. If you have an urgent need they will see you on the day but a general appointment takes about 2-3 weeks."
Victoria  ,Fantastic patient care,6/8/2022,5,"Member of staff that I saw was so warm and friendly, kind and gentle. Made me feel incredibly relaxed during an unpleasant procedure and was simply lovely. A real credit to the practice!"
Victoria  ,"Fantastic service, GP was very helpful",3/17/2020,5,The GP I saw was so helpful of my stressful situation and arranged the help I need with in a week.
Victoria  ,Fast and efficient experience,4/19/2022,5,I telephoned the surgery at 8am on a Monday and was contacted back by 10am that day and given a prescription. The antibiotics weren’t working by Wednesday so called in again at 8am and I was give a face to face appointment at 10:30. The GP decided I needed to go to WSH and arranged an appointment for me for 2pm the same day. I am very grateful for the care and attention I received. Thank you
Victoria  ,First class,11/24/2016,5,First class in every area.  No complaints at all
Victoria  ,Friendly staff,7/27/2018,5,The staff are all very friendly and its a good surgery
Victoria  ,Generally Impressed with the Whole Surgery,12/3/2020,5,"I am generally impressed with the whole surgery, the staff on the front desk are very cooperative and helpful. Doctors give time and do not rush me. Generally they find me an appointment quickly when I need one."
Victoria  ,Generally pretty good.,10/2/2016,4,Generally the practice is pretty good but it can be a difficult making appointments outside of normal worktime.
Victoria  ,Generally very happy,2/25/2022,4,"Generally very happy being able to get appointments when they've been needed, it all works well. It would be good to be able to book appointments online with other doctors, not just your own, as it would give more flexibility on times and days. Staff listen and give you time and there's no pressure to be quick when you're with them."
Victoria  ,getting an appointment is difficult,5/30/2017,3,Getting an appointment is difficult-there can be a 2-3 week delay
Victoria  ,Getting worse,12/8/2022,1,"Prescriptions are becoming a farce, this surgery is slowly becoming worse and worse managed, and when you look on the website for the practice managers' contact details, they're nowhere to be seen, this isn't good enough.

An example of how bad the surgery has become: I have type 1 diabetes and am going on holiday. Two weeks in advance I requested extra medication for the trip. A couple of days before my trip, I go to the pharmacy and the prescription issued is incorrect, it is only my normal requested medication, not the additional requested.

I go to the surgery, let them know of their mistake and they say to return the following day. I return the following day and a different member of staff at the dispensary, in front of a waiting room of people, had the absolute cheek to tell me off for chasing a prescription when she sarcastically and abruptly said ""You're meant to wait three days before chasing us"" 

Well... had the dispensary and the staff at Victoria Road Surgery got the request correct in the first instance, I wouldn't be needing to chase it, and if I wait the three days, I'd have to return from my holiday in order to collect my prescription. 

Frankly, given that I have type one diabetes, they know what I'm requesting and if I DON'T have my insulin I CAN LITERALLY DIE! to say anything along those lines to me is absurd. It's nothing but arrogant and rude!

Practice manager - get a grip of this."
Victoria  ,Given a choice,6/28/2022,5,"I've been able to get appointments when needed and I was offered a choice of phone call or a face to face today which was great. Staff have always been caring and great too and when I called this morning for an appointment for my child, we were seen quickly. I really can't fault the surgery."
Victoria  ,Given a choice,2/24/2022,5,I've found it very easy to get an appointment. I called last week and reception gave me a choice of appointments so I was able to choose the most convenient. The staff are friendly and approachable and they are great at getting you in and seen by a clinician.
Victoria  ,Good,10/18/2022,5,"Booking appointments with the online system is good and I'm finding it's working well at the moment. I also like the phone system when it tells you where in the queue you are, it's much better to know."
Victoria  ,good but slight delay in getting appt.,12/23/2015,4,Good understanding.  No delay on the day but have to book appointment at least 2 weeks in advance.  It would be easier if you had an appointment in the week that you phoned
Victoria  ,Good continuity,10/18/2022,5,"I like to see my own GP because I feel that it improves the care I receive. I booked my appointment with my GP in advance and it has meant a 2 week wait to be seen but thats fine. To get an urgent appointment would've been much sooner. One thing I don't like is being asked the reason for the appointment by reception staff, they're not medically trained. My husband asked to see a male doctor and this was questioned, you would've thought common sense would tell you that if someone asks something like that it's because the issue is delicate."
Victoria  ,Good Customer Service,12/3/2020,4,"Everyone is so friendly, good customer service. The doctor is very good, the one who I see is anyway, they do a good job here. No faults."
Victoria  ,Good overall,9/2/2016,4,It depends on which doctor you get to see. It is usually good but I once had an appointment with a doctor which was very poor.
Victoria  ,Good service,10/25/2021,4,"I generally just pick up my medication and rarely have need for an actual appointment and that works well, however, I do feel that if I need an appointment a face to face  with a doctor should be offered."
Victoria  ,Good Service at all times,12/3/2020,5,"Access to the surgery is easy you do not have to wait on the phone for ages before it is answered and when you do get through the staff are most accommodating. I have found it to be good service at all times myself, in fact I would say amazing service."
Victoria  ,Good surgery,9/13/2022,4,"Generally a good surgery with great staff and I've been able to get appointments when ever I've needed them. Today the dispensary gave me the wrong medication and unusually I didn't check the bag until I got home so I had to drive back in to town to get it all sorted.  Staff apologised and mistakes can happen and are very rare, its just a bit of a nuisance."
Victoria  ,GP's very good but receptionists rude,11/17/2016,4,GPs are very good.  Just find reception staff are rude
Victoria  ,Happy,2/25/2022,4,"I'm happy that I came in and spoke to reception who were helpful and was able to get an appointment with a nurse with in the week, so it's all been very good so far."
Victoria  ,Happy with how it works,2/25/2022,4,There have been no problems getting appointments and I'm satisfied with the treatment and care provided.  There's a bit of a mix of who you see but that works well and generally I'm happy with everything as the staff are good.
Victoria  ,Have always been seen fairly promptly,12/21/2021,4,"With everything else going on, the surgery has coped really well. The vaccine programme has been exceptional and they still find to see patients in need"
Victoria  ,Helpful and efficient,9/22/2016,4,Have always felt they were very helpful and efficient
Victoria  ,Helpful staff,10/18/2022,4,"Called yesterday and spoke to reception, they then arranged for the doctor to call me back. when I spoke to them on the phone I did say I felt I needed to be seen and I was given an appointment for this morning. I'm happy to see any of the staff as they are great and the staff are all helpful."
Victoria  ,Hit and miss on the service you get.,3/24/2023,3,"I have had times where receptionists have been so dismissive and rude. When I have rung for an appointment before, I get told immediately that I wont get one that day. Its like they are preparing for an argument, I wasn't ringing for an appointment that day, I was booking for one in advance. I've also had people really dismissive of my medication, when I have been explicitly told it puts me at high risk and I need to at least speak to a DR when certain symptoms occur. One receptionist challenged me about taking my medication when I had covid, and asked why I thought I needed to speak to someone and was incredibly rude about it. When the DR rang me back, they were concerned enough to want to see me, despite having covid, so the receptionist's attitude was wrong. I understand that they must get a lot of grief, but the fact remains that people are speaking to them because they are unwell and possibly scared. So patients aren't going to be jolly and smiley and receptionists need to not automatically assume that everyone is going to have a row with them. Also since taking over my medication from the hospital, my prescriptions were wrong for about 7 months they still get my blood reminders wrong 3 years on."
Victoria  ,Hopeless,2/11/2021,1,"was told had to use system to book a face to face appt. Registered as told and no appts avaiable.  Called back and was told I had to wait until the GP had accepted me and to try again tomorrow.  Appalling, I have been seriously ill in the past year and never ever bother the GP unless I really need to. This is terrible in my view"
Victoria  ,I called to book a home visit for my husband,6/20/2023,5,"Becoming worried about my husband's health, I phoned the surgery late in the morning. My call was answered quickly and the receptionist who took it was most friendly. understanding and helpful. She also managed to arrange for our own doctor to visit us at home. Altogether an excellent experience."
Victoria  ,I can always get an appointment,12/3/2020,5,"I find the doctor very good, I can always get an appointment and the same doctor which is good. I like the new decoration and the new floor it has made a real difference it looks much fresher. One of the reception staff can be a 'bit off' with her attitude but the others are lovely."
Victoria  ,I can get appointments when I need to,10/23/2019,5,"It is absolutely fine here, no issues at all. I can get appointments when I need to, its all round very good at this surgery."
Victoria  ,I Rate the Doctors Highly,12/3/2020,3,"It can often be a bit of a wait to get an appointment, sometimes up to a week, but I did get one today on the day which was good. From my experience it depends on who you see on how it is on arrival, one of the reception staff can be a bit abrupt. I do rate the doctors very highly."
Victoria  ,ID to register,6/28/2022,3,"I'm a new patient so not accessed any appointments yet. I did find that asking for ID a little over the top when I was trying to register, very different to how it used to be."
Victoria  ,I'm happy with this surgery,10/23/2019,4,"I am happy with this surgery overall, you do have to wait up to 2 weeks if you want a routine appointment which I feel is a bit too long, but they do find you one on the day if its deemed as urgent. I have to say the ladies on the front desk are very helpful."
Victoria  ,Impressed with the GPs,12/3/2020,5,"The individual GP's are very good, I am impressed with the quality of my GP 100%. I find it easy to get an appointment for my son on the same day, it can always feel  like the wait is longer with having to keep children occupied. More things for children would be good."
Victoria  ,Incredibly patient and helpful,12/1/2023,5,"Spoke to a person over the phone, in the pharmacy, after new diagnosis as concerned about running out of supplies given out in hospital. She explained the process and timescales etc very patiently."
Victoria  ,Lucky,6/28/2022,4,"Been very lucky, I was asked when I called whether I wanted  a face to face or a phone call and I chose a face to face which I really liked. To keep continuity I have stayed with the same GP so it's taken a little longer for the appointment but I'm happy with that. I've been very happy with the support provided by the GP following my operation,"
Victoria  ,More online booking options,2/25/2022,4,"It would be good if appointments could be booked with any doctor online and not just your own. At the height of covid I did find it more difficult to get my son seen for a specific condition. For his condition it really helps to have continuity with the doctor we see, this is now improving again."
Victoria  ,Most of the Drs are really good.,3/30/2016,4,Most of the Drs are really good but getting an appointment can be difficult at times.
Victoria  ,Mostly good...,9/2/2016,4,Most things about the surgery are good except answering the phone. There is often a delay.
Victoria  ,My doctor is exceptional,10/23/2019,4,"The staff on the front desk are very helpful and friendly and my doctor is exceptional. You can get an appointment on the day if you need it but for other things you do have to wait sometimes up to 2 weeks. The doctors make good referrals to the hospital. Its fantastic here really, shame the waiting room carpet is a bit mucky but I suppose you expect it."
Victoria  ,My doctor is outstanding,10/23/2019,4,The staff here have always been great with me. It would be helpful if a message could appear on the check in screen if a doctor is running late. My doctor is outstanding and I do feel the younger doctors are more understanding and more accepting and have more knowledge. I have been coming here all my life so there must be something pretty good here.
Victoria  ,No appointments available when I called,10/25/2021,3,"I called yesterday and would've liked to talk to someone to get an issue dealt with but was told nothing was available. It felt like reception staff were deciding who could be seen. I've called this morning and been given a face to face but feel I needed to be seen yesterday. I wasn't told what other options there were and where I could get help, just told to call back tomorrow."
Victoria  ,No complaints whatsoever,3/17/2016,5,I have been a patient here for some time and I have always been well satisfied. I have no complaints whatsoever
Victoria  ,No information given when kept waiting,7/24/2021,3,Waited half an hour in hot weather. Asked how much longer as had young children in hot car outside. Very terse receptionist said no idea and offered another appointment in three weeks! Why can't patient be given some idea of backlog of waiting time as they do in hospital.
Victoria  ,No problems,10/18/2022,5,I've had no problems getting appointments when I've needed them. For this appointment today I was called in by the surgery for a check-up and I've waited less than 10 days for it. The staff are brilliant and it seems to be a well organised surgery
Victoria  ,Nurses Very Good,12/3/2020,5,"The nurses are very good, it is a very good surgery overall. I think the children's activity table could be positioned in another location as I have seen mothers struggle a bit with push chairs around it."
Victoria  ,Nursing services are poor,11/24/2016,3,Having had to use a different surgery whilst on holiday I was able to compare the nursing facility.  The Victoria nursing facility was very poor in comparison.  Nurses do not seem to be able to be proactive or use their intelligence in providing care.  They do not display any autonomy (unlike the alternative practice) and in our case we had to explain what needed to be done. Rarely seen on time.  Usualy at least 20 minutes late
Victoria  ,Offered a face to face,6/28/2022,4,It's okay at the moment I was offered a face to face appointment with a GP which was great and was the person I needed to see.  The only very small issue I don't particularly like is having to tell reception what the issue is. I find it personal at times and you can see staff in the local community.
Victoria  ,One doctor spoils it for the whole surgery!,9/2/2021,2,"Asked for assistance with regards to a minor, only to be told, by the doctor himself ""I have people dying from Covid, i don't have time for this..."". Waited 2 weeks for this appalling phone appointment. It wasn't like he was my first port of call, I had exhausted all other routes and everyone else had said, GP needs to make the referral! So now we are stuck in limbo with ZERO faith in our GP."
Victoria  ,Phoned for swab results.,5/17/2022,1,"Told by receptionist results were abnormal. Informed I had to speak to the doctor. This Was a Friday and the earliest phone consultation was the following  Tuesday. Doctor phoned did not know why he was calling,  and basically it was down to the district nurses to tell him what they needed doing. Could not judge the wound unless he could see it, although there are loads of photos on System 1."
Victoria  ,Poor attitude of GP,5/2/2019,1,"Yesterday, when requesting a call back from a GP a doctor rang. Telephone manner was poor and would not listen to my fathers questions . The worst bit was that a doctor said I’ve got to go I have other calls to make. Now my father hardly uses the GP surgery and recently has been discharged from hospital and needed advise around the medication. This is not person centred care with a holistic approach. This ended up with my father who is only 69 becoming anxious. I work in health care and this incident in no circumstances follows the NHS Consitutions Values. I want others to be aware of this, as it is lucky my father has support from others or it could of resulted in a pointless time in Aand E which was not needed."
Victoria  ,Preventing access to Dr,8/31/2021,2,"Reception staff gatekeeping the doctors from patients and a lack of communication internally. Had an issue with repeat prescriptions that has gone on for months that has yet to be satisfactorily resolved. This has impacted mental health and work, leaving me distraught. These past few months, this issue has added to, not alleviated, my back pain. I can say nothing more than that."
Victoria  ,Really difficult to transfer from another GP,11/13/2021,2,"Had to visit admin three times, then a nurse, then the doctor who was surprised to see me."
Victoria  ,Reception good,6/3/2023,5,"Reception are good, there are occasional issues getting an appointment but they do what they can to help. I don't always find the telephone consultations  address the issues completely and can result in having to contact the surgery again."
Victoria  ,Reception Requires Better Training,3/8/2020,2,Communication issue with reception to the point where I felt I was about to cry. Oddly enough members of the public are not experts about specific practice processes or general NHS procedure. Higher empathy should be employed when speaking to public given this is a health service and conditions are often of a sensitive nature-  I would expect it to be built into training.
Victoria  ,Receptionists extremely rude and unwelcome,7/14/2021,1,"Long story short, gentleman in front on me rang the bell and no one came to the door so after 5 minutes he pressed it again. Then, eventually, they came out - then told me I had missed the appointment for my 4 month old baby! but could wait for over half an hour for another appointment. They were very rude with the way they went about it and it was completely unnecessary."
Victoria  ,Receptionists very helpful,1/20/2023,5,I try to book on line but if I need an appointment quicker I find that the receptionists are helpful. I try to be honest if it is not that urgent and they can usually arrange a telephone appointment at least.
Victoria  ,So good.,10/13/2021,5,"The receptionists were very helpful and kept apologising, which they did not need to. But, [the GP I saw] was the star. What a helpful and understanding Dr this is. Went out of their way today to help me. This surgery is kind and understanding."
Victoria  ,Speed and Responsiveness excellent,12/3/2020,5,The speed of being able to get at appointment and being responsive to the patients needs is excellent. The nurses are very good. The only thing I would say is that you can only ring to talk about repeat prescriptions in the afternoon now whereas you used to be able to ring morning or afternoons for this.
Victoria  ,Staff are very helpful,10/23/2019,5,"The staff here are good and very helpful. I am very happy with this surgery,  I've been coming here for years and no complaints. The carpet could do with a bit of a clean."
Victoria  ,Staff great,3/13/2023,5,I've had no problems getting an appointment for my child this morning and generally don't have any problems when we do need them for any member of the family. The staff are also great to deal with at all times.
Victoria  ,"Staff, Nurses and Doctors are great.",10/28/2022,4,I visit fairly regularly and always find the staff to be as helpful as they possibly can be.  I feel they genuinely care.  Appointments are the same as everywhere else but they do try to help if there is a problem.
Victoria  ,Supportive and efficient practice,7/5/2021,5,I rang the surgery on Friday for my son and the reception staff couldn't be more helpful.  They got a doctor to phone me back within an hour and he arranged for an appointment that afternoon.  With stories of people not being able to see their doctors at this time I was extremely impressed. The appointment was on time with no waiting and the doctor we saw was attentive and took his time.  I have only heard good things about Victoria Surgery during the pandemic and how professional and supportive they are.
Victoria  ,Take a while to get an appointment,10/20/2016,4,Very good generally but it can take a bit of a while to get an appointment
Victoria  ,Telephone consultations delay things,10/25/2021,3,It almost feels like being offered a telephone consultation is a delaying tactic as you have to wait for the call back and are then told to come in but sometimes it has been in another 2 weeks.Care and treatment when you do get seen though is very good.
Victoria  ,Telephone consultations good,10/18/2022,5,"I was 15th in the queue when I called but it didn't take long to get through and for reception to give me an appointment. The telephone consultations I've had have worked well in the past and have addressed the issues, and it does prevent having to come in to the surgery unnecessarily. It's nice that staff are friendly and know you, it's all good and works well for me."
Victoria  ,Terrible,9/28/2020,1,"Phoned 2 weeks ago for a triage appointment today, only to be told that the doctor is busy today and I need to phone back on Wednesday. 
I took the day off work for this appointment and now don’t even have one!"
Victoria  ,The online system is excellent,10/23/2019,5,The staff are very friendly and helpful here. I use the online system and I find it excellent. I am very happy with this surgery.
Victoria  ,The prescription team are so helpful,5/13/2021,5,"My teenage son has cancer and I have needed to get hold of prescriptions at short notice, nothing is too much trouble for the ladies who deal with perscriptions"
Victoria  ,They go 'above and beyond the call of duty',10/23/2019,4,"This is an overall good surgery, the front desk staff are helpful, they are very important to the surgery. I do have to wait a long time in the waiting room before we are called in. The dispensary staff are really excellent they go above and beyond the call of duty. Most of the GP's are very good. The surgery are doing the very best that they can. The appointment system seems to work well."
Victoria  ,Things have gone backwards!,9/2/2016,2,"The prescription line has gone backwards. There is no longer an online repeat prescription service, telephone line has restricted hours and no answerphone!"
Victoria  ,This Surgery is So Responsive,12/3/2020,5,"Really good here, they are so responsive and this has definitely improved over recent years. The quality of the GP and medical staff very good, I am able to ask questions so I get helpful responses. Please pass on compliments to all at the staff at Victoria surgery they are clearly all doing their best."
Victoria  ,Time with clinician is limited,2/25/2022,3,I called last week and was given an appointment and I haven't had to wait long. I do feel that the time you have with a clinician is limited and it can feel they just want to get you out.  Mental health support and care is lacking at times too.
Victoria  ,too long a wait,3/17/2016,3,"Getting to see a doctor is a real, real problem. There is much too long a wait"
Victoria  ,Triage works well,10/25/2021,5,"The triage system works well. I've been able to get appointments when I've needed them and considering the current situation the practice are doing really well. The flu jabs have worked really well too, a very smooth process."
Victoria  ,Try to see same GP,10/18/2022,5,"It can take a little time to get appointments with either a nurse or a GP, but I do try to see the same doctor if possible as they know me well. I can't fault the staff, reception, dispensary or doctors, they are all very good, as is communication and their explanations."
Victoria  ,Unable to get face to face appt,9/29/2020,3,"Having to tell unqualified reception staff before what is wrong with us   .before a doctor even rings us is terrible .
we have not been offered a face to face appt since feb .which I feel is a case of maybe missing something important"
Victoria  ,Unclear which online system to use,2/25/2022,4,"The last time I saw the nurse they booked this appointment for me and that system works really well when you have to come regularly. I do find that there are now so many different online systems available like the nhs app, econsult and the old practice system I'm unsure which to use when."
Victoria  ,Useful to know if Doctor is running late,10/23/2019,5,"The staff are very friendly and the doctors and the nurses are very helpful and give positive referrals. It would be useful to know if the doctor is running late. Getting an appointment can be a little frustrating as you can wait up to 2 weeks, but if you are really poorly they will get you in on the day. Car park is too small."
Victoria  ,Very busy phones,6/28/2022,3,"It's very busy call the surgery first thing and I often try to call a bit later on. The surgery have offered to get a translator in should I need it, and for more serious issues I would do this.  I do find the call backs a bit difficult, I missed one call back as I was driving and when I called straight back I was told I would need to call again the next day, this seems a little unfair."
Victoria  ,Very good,6/3/2023,5,"Its a very good surgery, I've been here for years. They are easy to contact and arrange appointments with and I use either the online option or the phone depending on the situation.  Being able to book appointments online tends to be for more advance appointments but I like that you can choose who you see and when to come in. Staff are good at explaining everything and I don't really feel anything needs to change."
Victoria  ,Very happy with GP seen today,10/18/2022,4,I'm very happy with the GP I've seen today. They have been very good at explaining the situation but it was only by chance I got to see my preferred GP today. I do prefer to see them as I have a long term condition and feel it's important as they understand my history with out having to explain everything each time. I don't feel that reception staff fully understand the need for an appointment sometimes when I'm talking with them and that can make it more difficult.
Victoria  ,Very helpful staff,6/3/2023,5,"I try to use systemone to book my appointments in advance as I can decide who to see and when best suits me, I even managed to book an appointment this morning this way as I'm happy to see any of the doctors. It can feel a little rushed at times when you are with a doctor but on the whole staff are very helpful and provide good care and treatment."
Victoria  ,"Very helpful, kind and respectful.",3/2/2023,5,"On line booking was very easy and quick, the Doctor was kind and compassionate and was able to give the treatment needed, and the receptionist and pharmacist have been very helpful and professional."
Victoria  ,Very polite reception staff,10/25/2021,5,"I can easily get appointments for my legs to be treated by the nurses and they are doing such an excellent job, a really accommodating and efficient practice."
Victoria  ,Very well looked after,10/19/2016,5,I am lucky in that I don't need to go very often but when I do need them I am very well looked after.
Victoria  ,Visit to practice Nurse,10/24/2020,5,"The Nurse was so kind, gentle and very caring when dealing with my surgical wound."
Victoria  ,"Welcoming ,they really understand our needs",6/23/2023,5,"Truly professional people at this practice, I don’t know what I would do without this Surgery"
Victoria  ,Wonderful doctors,10/25/2021,4,The doctors are wonderful but I do feel that not all appointments suit a phone consultation as not everything can be diagnosed that way. I've had to wait a little while for blood tests at the surgery and it can take 40 minutes to get through in the morning by which time there are no appointments available. It would be nice if they explained what to do if there are no appointments available on the day you call.
Victoria  ,You cannot fault them,10/23/2019,4,"The front desk staff are polite and friendly. I've been at this practice all of my life and you cannot fault them, they will always do their best to fit you in. I do find the GP's explain things well, they are very good here. The carpet is a bit dirty in the waiting area."
Victoria Road,Able to see someone,8/24/2021,4,"I have had to have a few ring backs before being offered todays appointment, which I understand. I have tried the medication given, but still with same issue to have come in. So, although it takes longer to get in to see someone, you do, and my issue is not what I would say is too urgent."
Victoria Road,Abroad scan acted on,1/12/2021,5,After a medical abroad in my home country we presented a scan result to the GP here and they have put through an urgent referral 'no questions asked' within 8 weeks my partner was in the James Paget hospital having the operation. We await a biopsy for this. We thank the surgery for their rapid response.
Victoria Road,Access for working man,9/9/2022,4,"As my husband works, he finds it hard to get an appointment, so gives up as he is quite 'typical', and it is hard enough to get him to call in the first place. I had not heard of the extended hours service, so I will now tell him about that, as I know he would travel elsewhere."
Victoria Road,Accommodatable Surgery,11/20/2017,4,Always been a good surgery for my needs
Victoria Road,Always a wait for appointment,5/25/2017,3,Always wait longer than 20 minutes when I have an appointment.  GP told me tablets that I could change to would be £100 for 60 tablets
Victoria Road,Always have excellent service,1/3/2022,5,"This is a proper GP service where I usually see my own GP who knows me and my medical history. All staff are really friendly and efficient and there is a nice atmosphere in the practice.
I feel well supported as a patient that they are managing my needs."
Victoria Road,Appointment straight away today,10/29/2018,5,I phoned today and got an appointment straight away.  If need to see my own GP I need to wait.  It would be nicer if you were looked at rather than them looking at a screen.
Victoria Road,Appointment system,7/12/2018,5,"I have been at this surgery for a number of years, and the change to how you get appointments has, as far as I can see, had a positive impact on the surgery. There is no where near as many people sitting here as there used to be."
Victoria Road,Appointment today,9/9/2022,5,"I rang yesterday and was offered a GP appointment, but as I wanted to see the same GP as last time I was advised to call today, which I did. Although I was 11th in the queue, it was answered in 5 minutes and I got in to see the GP of my choice, so I am happy. Excellent!"
Victoria Road,Appointments run behind,7/12/2018,4,"I have been with this surgery for some time now and I find mainly it is really good. I just find appointments run behind most of the time, and you do not always get told that this is the case."
Victoria Road,Attending for my first Astra Zeneca vaccine,2/16/2021,5,"Perfect organisation from the pleasant marshalling of parking the cars, no waiting, social distancing, wearing of masks, instructions on where to go, being given the vaccine and it was a bitterly cold day but those outside where cheerful and professional agree with everyone else."
Victoria Road,Awful for mental health,9/8/2021,1,"(This review will mention aspects of bad mental health please be forwarned) I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety for over 6 years, after moving to Bury St Edmunds I needed to find a GP in order to have antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds re-prescribed for the UK. The receptionists are some of the most gruff people I've ever had the misfortune to interact with - especially when in such a fragile state. They are borderline mocking with their intensive questioning, tell you off for crying, cut you off midsentence and I have had the phone hung up on me countless times (if they even answer). And that's before you even get to your doctor. 

When the Dr was informed of my suicidal ideation and dehabilitating panic attacks by the mental health nurse and myself they were patronising, cold and tried to downplay my incredibly dangerous symptoms to ""a little down and a little worried"". I did not receive the urgency of care I needed at that point and I dread to think what could have happened to me had I not been living with kinder people. Anyone who has had experience with mental health issues either personally or with people they love understand how hard it can be on a day to day basis, doctors should be understanding and compassionate rather than unkind and difficult. 

I was recommended for a referral to a mental health team and had to chase up my referral 3 times. A nurse specifically placed my details, forms and personal statements on their desk, yet I was told to rewrite everything over a month later (after no communication from anyone at the surgery) because they had 'lost' the documents and needed new ones to refer me. This is a concerning amount of time for someone at a crisis point. 

I know my mental health is not taken seriously and the gps have an alarming amount of ignorance around mental health issues."
Victoria Road,Been trying for an appointment for 3 weeks,4/11/2018,1,Call queue in operation for appointments phone at 8 am and every day by the time I get through to receptionist there's no appointments left
Victoria Road,Best Surgery Ever !,11/13/2019,5,"Cannot praise enough, Its the best surgery ever ! look after me very well with my ongoing conditions."
Victoria Road,Better appointments and longer opening hours,6/4/2019,5,"I have seen some real improvements in this surgery, the appointments are better and they stay open longer. 
I have seen improvements with the front desk staff attitude.
Pharmacy is very obliging."
Victoria Road,Bit of a queue on phone,9/9/2022,5,"I rang yesterday but they advised me to call the next day at 8am. I was surprised that I was 18 in the queue, but I got an appointment today with the GP, so I am pleased with that."
Victoria Road,Calling at 8am can be challenging,11/13/2019,5,"Calling at 8am can be challenging. Can be given an appointment time that cannot be physically be made such as when ringing after school called about our unwell child, was given an appointment in 30mins when the journey is 45 mins but was told this was the next allocated slot, so I couldn't make it, I rang 8am next day instead."
Victoria Road,Can book 2 weeks ahead on line,11/13/2019,4,"Mainly book appointments on line, can book 2 weeks ahead but feel this could be extended."
Victoria Road,Can get an appointment when you need one,2/5/2019,4,"Can get an appointment when need one. Do not mind seeing any GP. Can run behind sometimes at appointments, but on't mind as it's never more than 20 minutes and my GP is worth waiting for."
Victoria Road,Communication is poor,2/5/2019,3,"Moved here with a long term condition and was taken off all medication immediately, no 'alternative' and no 'gradual withdrawal', very bizarre. No consideration for my condition which is debilitating."
Victoria Road,Consistently good,2/5/2019,5,Excellent consistency over the 25 years I have been here. They have come to our house after my husband was hospitalised and then home. Cannot fault the care.
Victoria Road,Could be more flexible,2/5/2019,3,Things here could be more flexible. Trying to see same GP can be difficult especially for a return appointment after a few weeks for a check up. Consistency needs to be better for ongoing conditions.
Victoria Road,Excellent,11/20/2017,5,To date I have received excellent service;  long may it continue.
Victoria Road,Excellent,11/20/2017,5,A very good service overall
Victoria Road,Excellent service,9/9/2022,5,They contacted me to get up-to-date blood test and got me in quickly. Any time needed an appointment 'on the day' it has worked well. My child who is deaf uses online and I have to come in with her to sign.
Victoria Road,Excellent well run GP practice,7/5/2018,5,"This is an excellent well run GP practice. Very efficient appointments system, always possible to obtain consultation same day if needed. Adequate parking available. Supplied or arranged several treatments with efficiency, care and courtesy."
Victoria Road,Fast and life saving appointment,8/25/2022,5,"I would personally like to thank the two doctors after I had been failed by a different surgery for a lump and pain in my throat. I was dismissed and made to feel like I wasted their time and told to go home and drink plenty of water. The doctors at Victoria surgery however, thoroughly checked me over and immediately referred me to James Paget and after many appointments and biopsies, and I was sadly diagnosed with throat cancer which ended uo with surgery at Norfolk and Norwich, removing the left tonsil and lymph glands. However, yesterday I had the great news that the cancer is gone and the surgery was successful so is forever grateful to Victoria surgery doctors who recognised my concerns and acted promptly and listened to me, if it wasn't for them, it would not have been caught early and therefore could have had a very different outcome. I also want to thank the nurse who assisted me with my wound and dressing. I am forever grateful. Thank you
Kind regards"
Victoria Road,Feel let down,8/24/2021,2,"I feel this surgery has let my gran down who I was with at her most recent appointment. It took 3 attempts to see someone and she was in so much pain. On the last visit we saw (first name given but did not say if they knew it was a GP). This person prescribed a gel (anti-inflammatory I think), but it seemed strange as the leg has open wound and looked infected to us.  The same day after being in the surgery she ended up in hospital as in so much pain. She is now on anti-biotics and been in a bed in James Paget hospital for 5 days."
Victoria Road,"Feel well cared for, car park is poor",6/4/2019,5,"Very friendly and helpful staff, if you have a problem they try to sort it out. Depending on the GP you can be waiting longer for the GP.
Good and clear explanation from GP's I have always felt very well cared for by this surgery.
The parking is dreadful."
Victoria Road,feels safe in here,8/24/2021,4,I do find the surgery safe feeling inside. The waiting room is a good size and there is good ventilation. I have an appointment today and did not feel anxious about it when I came in.
Victoria Road,Friendly helpful staff,6/4/2019,4,"Getting an emergency appointment is fine on the day. It's usually about a 2 week wait for a general appointment. 
The explanation from the GP is very good. The staff are always friendly and helpful."
Victoria Road,Getting through on phone is impossible,11/13/2019,4,Getting through on phone is impossible. You may not have urgent need but a week later it may become urgent and then you cannot get in for another few days.
Victoria Road,Good access for child,10/29/2018,5,"When needing appointment for my child everything is good.  Access for myself is less easy and I find the communication between Mental health services that I use with the surgery, really poor."
Victoria Road,Good all round,8/24/2021,4,"Whenever I have needed to see someone, they have seen me. It has always been a good surgery all round and they adapted to the pandemic. I can use the online system, and I do for some things if less urgent. I tend to call the phone line if it is more urgent as you get a feel for the timescales more."
Victoria Road,Good all round care,8/24/2021,5,The surgery for me has been consistently very good. During the tighter restrictions I was able to talk to a professional. Today I am in to see someone. I feel confident they are doing the best they can for me too.
Victoria Road,Good and can often see my own GP,11/20/2017,4,"A good service.  I use it quite often and in the main see my own GP, which I like"
Victoria Road,Good appointment system,10/29/2018,4,"Good appointment system here that works well for the majority.  The surgery can often run behind, today it is more than 25 minutes for me."
Victoria Road,Good at getting appointments when needed,11/13/2019,5,"Good at getting appointments when needed. usually runs behind, today it is 35 mins at the moment, seeing nurse practitioner and was 10.20 so not that far into the day."
Victoria Road,Good but can wait on 'phone for appointment,11/20/2017,4,Only gripe can be waiting on the telephone to get through for an appointment
Victoria Road,Good care,7/12/2018,5,I am here today for my child's injections. Feel very well looked after. They show they care by keeping us here for 20 minutes after giving the injection.
Victoria Road,"Good clear explanations, poor car park",6/4/2019,4,"My GP gives good clear explanations and will refer on to relevant services. 
Parking is a nightmare, minimal space."
Victoria Road,Got appointment,8/24/2021,5,I got an appointment today after I had spoken to someone before. They were good at asking me the right things and so it does give you the confidence in the practice
Victoria Road,Got appointment easily,2/5/2019,4,Got an appointment easily today with a GP. Running behind which is normal
Victoria Road,GP always has time for me,7/12/2018,5,"With my on-going rare Brain disease I have found my surgery to be excellent. Although appointments always run behind (30 minutes today), I do not mind as my GP gives me the time I need and I respect that they will do that for other patients too."
Victoria Road,GP/Nurse decided by reception,7/12/2018,4,"The surgery on the whole is excellent. I do however, find that being allocated a GP/Nurse by receptionist is not right. They are not medically trained so how do they know by my few words that I am deemed to need a GP over a Nurse or vice versa. I'm sure it is just down to capacity as I have seen a GP when I know a nurse would suffice. Being the gate keepers to me is just wrong."
Victoria Road,Great care here,10/29/2018,5,Always have had great care here.  Treatments/Symptoms always well explained.  Appointments are thorough
Victoria Road,Had minor surgery today and couldn’t fault it,8/30/2022,5,This surgery is run how a surgery should be run. I had minor surgery there today and was looked after excellently. The nurse was amazing. The doctor was excellent and very professional. Cannot fault this surgery at all. Thank you to all who work there.
Victoria Road,Happy to get in for appointment,8/24/2021,4,"All appointments for my babies check have been only 1 week behind. It could have been so much worse, so I think the service is coping really well in the difficult situation."
Victoria Road,Happy with care from surgery,6/4/2018,5,Very happy with care we got and the help too.
Victoria Road,Hard to know when it is my turn,3/17/2016,3,"I have a dual sensory loss. Your name appears on a plaque that I cannot read. I always ask the receptionist to ask the doctor to come out and get me, but they say that that is not possible and I just have to ask someone next to me. I do find that ridiculous. they always used to come and get you before technology was as it is these days."
Victoria Road,"Have to wait, but a good surgery overall",6/4/2019,5,"There is usually a bit of a wait to get a routine appointment, but urgent is on the day. Sometimes the staff on the phone can be a bit obstructive, but face to face there is no issues they are all very polite.
This is a good surgery overall."
Victoria Road,Holiday appointment,9/30/2021,4,"Called today, we are here on holiday and we got an appointment straight away. Got seen very quickly after arriving. Very efficient service."
Victoria Road,I find it difficult to speak about 1 thing,11/13/2019,3,"I find it difficult to speak about 1 thing as some things are related, you can usually get through it in the allocated time though."
Victoria Road,I have trust,8/24/2021,5,"I rang yesterday to ask for a callback with the Nurse Practitioner as I have a real trust for her and am worried about something. She decided I was best to come in and see a GP today about it, and my appointment was made for today. Really excellent service. Can ask for not more.
(patient came out of the appointment) - I have now seen the GP and they were very thorough and been able to put my mind at rest."
Victoria Road,I turn up to get appointments now,10/29/2018,4,"I do not have a problem getting an appointment any more as I just go to the surgery at 7.50 am.  I used to try and call and it was just frustrating trying to get through.  Once I did get through all the appointments had gone, so that why I just turn up at the door."
Victoria Road,In for baby checks,8/24/2021,5,I am pleased that the surgery have kept on time for my babies check and vaccinations. It was easy to make the appointment and they got me in at pretty short notice.
Victoria Road,Linking up with other services,10/29/2018,4,"This surgery has been excellent in getting to see my child, however, the link up with Mental Health services is really poor.  No one know what the other is doing.  Keep repeating your story to the GP.  It is so exhausting and puts you off trying to get help.  I had to go Private for some things as the waiting was far to long to access the service my child needed."
Victoria Road,Long wait at appointments,7/12/2018,4,"When I need an appointment I can get one on the day, however they usually are running quite late. 10-20 minutes is time but more than 30 minutes is too much as I'm usually stuck for time myself. Keeping your child entertained when there is such a delay is really difficult."
Victoria Road,"Long wait for appointment, car park poor",6/4/2019,3,"Waiting 3 weeks for an appointment. Sometimes the person on the phone can be a bit condescending at times, usually face-to-face interaction is fine. I feel my GP is very thorough.
The phone system is challenging, it seems to cut you off after 15 minutes. 
The car park is VERY difficult."
Victoria Road,Long wait for appointments,6/4/2019,4,"Making an appointment is the most challenging aspect of the service, with 2-3 weeks waiting. 
Parking is appalling.
Staff are very friendly and obliging.
Due to a misdiagnosis I decided to go private over a matter."
Victoria Road,Looked after me,7/12/2018,5,They have always looked after me so well over the years.
Victoria Road,Lovely surgery,11/20/2017,5,Very good care very kind
Victoria Road,Monthly appointment for injections work well,11/13/2019,5,Surgery has been excellent. Need to access appointments on the day more easily though. I have monthly injections and these appointments are pre booked and that works well.
Victoria Road,More consideration needed.,11/20/2017,3,"I have had trouble many times getting an appointment, spoken to a bit rudely.  I do not like to disclose personal problems and do not call the practice unless I have to but you are made to feel you are putting them out."
Victoria Road,Online system easy to use,8/24/2021,4,"I personally find the online system easy to use, and you do get a call back on the same day. They have resolved things a couple of times without seeing me and today I am in as they felt a face to face appointment is needed. I do trust the system as so far it has always worked for me. I think the only thing that could make it better, is if they could give you a rough time slot that is within 1 hour, just due to some commitments that can be difficult to change if expecting a call at some point that day"
Victoria Road,"Overall pretty good, glad I registered here",8/20/2019,4,"Staff have listened and acted / gave advice appropriately, thank you. Staff went out of their way to support my daughter though there is one nurse who I'd prefer not to see again as she gave incorrect advice about my asthma management

Would like to be able to book some GP appointments in advance, it's difficult when juggling work and kids to organise 'on the day' appointments.

Goodness knows what could be done about the parking issue, mostly manage to get a space though"
Victoria Road,Overall very good,7/12/2018,5,"Find that appointments are difficult to get and things do tend to run late. I have just got used to it.
The medical staff are always kind, but receptionists can be a bit rude."
Victoria Road,Overall very happy,9/13/2018,5,Can wait beyond 20 minutes at appointments. Could do with some toys for the children. My GP is excellent and I feel listened to.
Victoria Road,"Overall, very happy with the service",3/15/2018,5,"Overall I'm very happy with my experience at my GP surgery, considering how under pressure the NHS is under."
Victoria Road,Packet changes do not help,3/17/2016,3,"As I have dual sensory loss, I get used to my medication being in a particular design of box. Then when they change it no one tells you and it gets confusing."
Victoria Road,Poor communication and quality of care,7/25/2018,1,"Prescription ordered before Christmas, no sign. 2 District nurses ordered. 10/1 rang pharmacy item never ordered. Patient not told!! Item for catheter. 20 mins on phone, then told to ring Liverpool to main catheter equipment base. Never been able to do this before!! Now waiting another week for it to arrive. Patient not well, catheter bag chemical reaction supposed to be changed immediately - district nurse not interested. Phone call over 1 hour!!"
Victoria Road,Positive experience to date,6/4/2019,5,"I have opted for a sit and wait urgent appointment today and I got in easily.
The experience of the GPs has always been very positive to date."
Victoria Road,"Positive experience, a bit more questioning",6/4/2019,4,"I don't come very often but my experience so far has been positive. Sometimes the staff can be a bit sharp in their tone when trying to book an appointment. 
I wish the GP would prompt a few more questions to give more clarity of explanation."
Victoria Road,Presciption withdrawal,7/12/2018,5,"We have always needed skin cream for the 3 children's skin conditions. However, the skin creams are no longer being prescribed or the bath oil, whereas it is at Kirkley Mill. It can get expensive.
On the day appointments have been easy to get, I always get through straight away."
Victoria Road,Queue outside for appointments is so long,11/13/2019,2,Things lately have not been very good. Queue outside for appointments has got so long. Community development officer explained that appointments were delayed for a few days due to computer system change so people were asked to come back at the end of the month which many did.
Victoria Road,Reception staff rude,12/18/2020,3,The only improvement would be for the reception staff to be polite. Come across rude and will ignore you standing there. It would be a better experience to be treated with politeness and respect.
Victoria Road,Ringback fine for me,8/24/2021,4,"I have not used the service very much, but I have found the ringback fine and seen a nurse once face to face, this was very good and they were able to resolve my concerns."
Victoria Road,Seeing someone today,8/24/2021,4,"I do not use the online system, so I appreciate that I can ring in, tell them what I am concerned about then sometimes I have had a ring back and that was enough, but today I am in as yesterday they said it would be good to see me. It worried me before that I may not be seen, but they do, when it is appropriate in my experience."
Victoria Road,Staff need to read mask exempt rules,6/16/2021,1,"You do not have to give a reason why you are mask exempt, but it appears this surgery don’t read the rules and are a constant nightmare to mask exempt people. Staff need to be respectful and no one should be made to explain in front of everyone."
Victoria Road,Still waiting for a referral letter,11/13/2019,3,"Still awaiting a referral letter. I was given one initially and told to go to the hospital but went to the hospital and they had no information. I have asked again and just told to wait, but it feels like they may have forgotten me."
Victoria Road,Surgery is not great,11/13/2019,2,"Surgery is not great. Never known a time like it. Difficult to get appointments as GP's work less hours (4 days), receptionists ask me what's wrong so they can stop you from seeing a GP and can take ages to get through on telephone. Community development officer has explained care navigation and that new computer system has caused glitches and so appointments are taking longer, they also explained that GP's often work very long days,60 hours over 4 days. Patient still feeling negative about it."
Victoria Road,Surgery normally excellent,1/30/2018,3,"I see my GP quite often due to ongoing health condition. On this occasion I felt my GP just was not interested, which agitated me."
Victoria Road,Taking the strain of the closed surgery,3/17/2016,3,"It is obvious that my surgery is being affected by the closure of the others in the area. when I can get an appointment I am on time, then I have to wait for up to an hour sometimes."
Victoria Road,Timely checks,8/24/2021,4,"In for the check today for my baby. The surgery have kept to within a week of when the checks are due, which is good as I know some other mums have waited for a few weeks after their due time for the checks. I find the staff really pleasant and it is good that we can be inside the surgery and still feel safe."
Victoria Road,Took ages to get an appointment,11/13/2019,3,"Took ages to get an appointment. Checked in and said was 10 mins late, it is now 40 mins late."
Victoria Road,Unless queue at 8am you don't get appointment,11/13/2019,3,Unless you queue up at 8am outside you don't get an appointment. tried 3 days on the trot this week and finally today I managed to get one. I had to not take the children to school and get someone else to do so that I could go to the surgery earlier.
Victoria Road,Use online system,10/29/2018,5,"In the main we get appointments easily as we use the online system and by 7.30 am we can usually book for that day if we need to.  It is easy to use and more people should try it.
If we have to call in, it can take longer.  Generally appointments run behind time, which is not great."
Victoria Road,Very friendly staff,6/4/2019,4,"Staff very friendly.
Getting an appointment can be easy but sometimes there is a wait."
Victoria Road,Very good but hard to get appointment,3/15/2018,4,"Overall very good, but it's the usual complaint - hard to get appointment. Dr. very good"
Victoria Road,Very good support once referred,4/9/2015,4,The hard part is being assessed and a doctor agreeing to refer you to Victoria House.  Once I was referred there I had very good support.
Victoria Road,Very happy with my current doctor,5/9/2018,5,I have been a patient here for some years and over time I have come to value a particular GP. I have been to others but this one suits me very well. I sometimes have to wait up to three weeks for an appointment but I am happy with this as I know I could see another doctor more quickly in an emergency.
Victoria Road,Very happy with service,3/17/2016,5,I cannot fault the surgery in my experience. I am just very satisfied with the service.
Victoria Road,Very supportive,4/9/2015,4,My CPN listened and continued to support me until we both felt I was ready to be discharged and helped me to gain a place in supported housing.
Victoria Road,Waiting time and communication is awful,12/2/2018,1,"Prescription ordered before Christmas - no sign, 2 districts nurse ordered. I rang pharmacy, item never ordered. Patient not told! Item for catheter. 20 Mins on phone then told to ring Liverpool to Main Catheter equipment base. Never been able to do this before! Now waiting another week for it to arrive. Patient not well, catheter bag chemical reaction supposed to be changed immediately - District Nurse not interested. Phone call over 1 hour!"
Victoria Road,Waiting times,10/29/2018,4,"Generally getting an appointment when I have needed one is good, like today. I just find it is always running behind by more time than I find acceptable.  It is only 10 am and they are running more than 20 minutes behind.  I just find that rather ridiculous."
Victoria Road,Waiting times at appointments,10/29/2018,4,"Most of the time the surgery runs at least 20 minutes behind, even when you are here at the beginning of the day."
Victoria Road,Waiting times at appointments,10/29/2018,4,"Waiting at appointments is usually an issue.  Today it is just over 30 minutes.  I have nowhere to go, but if I did I would be annoyed."
Victoria Road,Was not informed about GP letter charges £15,11/13/2019,5,"On the screen in the waiting room it says you can ask for a telephone appointment with GP, so when I called to ask for one they said they are not doing them anymore. I also had need for a letter relating to benefits, I had a friend pick it up and was charged £15, I was not told this up front about the charge."
Victoria Road,Wheelchair access is difficult,8/1/2018,3,"Access from the pavement for a wheelchair needs to be addressed. One side is really tight, you almost fall off the curb in wheelchair. The other side is wider but no dropped curb. Also a pole in the way which makes it even tighter."
Victoria Road,Worked well for me,9/9/2022,5,"I find the service on the whole works ok for me. I do work so when I use the online system if I am not off work too unwell. If I am too unwell I ring in. The ring back has been difficult, but they usually try me a couple of times."
Walton,20 minutes trying to get through,10/29/2018,4,Getting through on the telephone can be difficult. Kept trying to get through for 20 minutes today. It would be good to have a queuing system.
Walton,30 minutes late today,10/29/2018,3,They are running more than 30 minutes late today and I am not sure why.  Communicating 'why' to patients would be great. It is very quiet in the the waiting room
Walton,Access good,5/3/2019,5,Had a blood test toady and as usual was treated very well by the HCA.  I have had no problem accessing the service.
Walton,All just OK,11/13/2019,4,"All here is just OK, nothing however is Outstanding."
Walton,Appalling,4/2/2020,1,If I could rate this no stars I would. Absolutely awful treatment refusing  appointments when they are desperately needed and being told not to bother the next day as you will not be given an appointment.
Walton,Appointment availability,11/13/2019,4,Just wish there was more appointments available to make on the day OR be able to pre-book.
Walton,Appointment system,11/13/2019,4,I do not like the current system. Would like to be able to make appointments in advance.
Walton,Awful and no care for its patients,1/29/2019,1,"This is an awful surgery, I have had my daughters 8 weeks jabs moved 3 times now and keep putting the appointment back a week, now I’ve had 3 days off work unpaid because a surgery can’t stick to it appointments this is appalling and a disgrace. I believe the tax payer pays for the surgery services and still they can’t provide it."
Walton,Been ok if you see nurse,1/13/2020,4,"If willing to see Nurse, you get in. If want to see a GP, well it just doesn’t happen. With my condition I cannot see how seeing a Nurse today will resolve it, so likely to mean another appointment but with GP if I can get one. That’s two instead of one appointment."
Walton,Better access for mum,1/13/2020,4,"I bring my mum, who has mobility issues and I wish they would allow access through the back door like they used to. I wanted to put it in the suggestion box, but there is no paper available! 20 mins late seeing nurse for blood test, and waiting can stress mum with her dementia. Staff are all lovely though."
Walton,Blood test today,2/28/2019,4,"Surgery is pretty good across most fronts.  Do not use it much. I am having a blood test here today which was easy to make the appointment for.  Good to have the service delivered locally, as it is much more convenient than having to head to the hospital."
Walton,Cannot book appointments with doctor!,2/26/2019,1,"Walton Surgery has a ridiculous system of not allowing people to book an appointment with their doctor in advance, even when a practice nurse has told you that you need to! Scrabbling for the phone at 8.30 every day is fine for people that are not trying to run a business."
Walton,Cannot praise enough,1/13/2020,5,"For myself or my children whenever I have rang the surgery always try get a solution for us. If appointments are gone they organise a callback. If there are nurses appointments left they give you one so that you have your mind put at rest.
Always lovely with a ‘can do ‘ attitude"
Walton,Closure inevitable,5/3/2020,3,"Getting appointments here was always the issue and this was obviously due to lack of staff.  So it was inevitable that it would close, and so although we are not surprised we are saddened by it for all the staff who were here, working so hard.  We have now moved to The Grove which we hope will be ok."
Walton,Do not use often,2/28/2019,5,When I need the service all works fine for me.  Usually only access couple times a year
Walton,Everybody so caring and helpful,1/24/2018,5,"The receptionists and nursing staff are all polite and helpful. The GP's are polite, caring and reassuring. (Received 'good' to 'very good' CQC results)."
Walton,Excellent,4/24/2017,5,Cannot fault the service really.  Hope it carries on with all the changes happening in the area
Walton,Excellent,4/24/2017,5,"No real issues here, but I do not use the surgery very often.  I never see my own GP but that is no issue for me but can understand that for others it could be"
Walton,Excellent,4/18/2017,5,Never have an issue getting appointments
Walton,Excellent - GP Federation seems to be working well,4/24/2017,5,"New GP,  GP federation appears to be working ok appears to be very keen, pleasant and interested in his patients.  GP federation appears to be working ok .GPs in hospital a good idea but for what periods?
Day and night? Will GPs be sacrificed in their own surgeries?  Who is paying for their time?  Is this out of CCG funds??"
Walton,Excellent but appointments run late,4/18/2017,5,Appointments run late most of the time
Walton,Excellent care and attention,2/28/2019,5,"In for a blood test, which I can always get an appointment for when I need one as it is linked to my diabetes.  I have received consistently, excellent care and attention by GP and Nursing staff."
Walton,Fine for flu jab....,11/13/2019,3,...but I have decided not to seek help here if I become ill because I do NOT want to discuss my symptoms with anyone other than Doctor or Nurse.
Walton,Flu clinic,11/13/2019,4,"Here for flu jab today and I had it 10 minutes after the appointment, which for a 1 minute job at the early part for the day is not great."
Walton,Friendly,11/13/2019,5,"Always friendly, professional and highly trained"
Walton,Friendly staff,11/13/2019,4,"The staff are very friendly here. The appointments however, quite often run late."
Walton,Get appointments,2/28/2019,4,"As so far I have been able to get an appointment when I have needed one, I feel the service is good.  Only thing you find is that things do run late most of the time (more than acceptable 20 mins+)"
Walton,Getting used to it,11/13/2019,4,Fairly good service now that I am getting used to the appointment system and prescription availability.
Walton,Gone downhill,10/29/2018,2,"Feel things have gone downhill as I no longer see one GP consistently. However, as the HWS CDO has explained that they now have permanent GP's this should get better hopefully."
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,"I can usually get an appointment when I need one, but with more houses going up in the area this may change"
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,One of the better surgeries I have been to in my time
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,With my GP retiring the linkup from the hospital in relation to a letter has not been good at all.  We are now seeing the new GP to get it all sorted out
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,Always been a good practice.  I hope it stays open longterm
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,"I do not use the surgery much, but find it to be a good service when I do"
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,"On a few occasions my appointment has not been within 20 minutes of its time, which I feel is reasonable to expect. It is hard as I need the toilet sometimes.  I like it that the doctor comes and gets you rather than buzz as I have a hearing loss."
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,Good local surgery.  Can get appointment when when I rarely need one
Walton,Good,4/24/2017,4,Moved to this practice from another due to the GP I was under.  Let's say we had a disagreement.  Today here I saw the nurse and then needed to see a GP.  They managed to get me in straightaway.  Today though is quiet
Walton,Good,4/18/2017,4,A good service that I like as it's small and well staffed.  Would not like to lose it
Walton,good,7/3/2019,4,A good service
Walton,Good,12/4/2016,4,Explanation of treatment / medicine could be fuller at times
Walton,Good but communication could be better,4/24/2017,4,Now I know about the local merger I have concerns that we may lose this site and I would find it difficult to travel too far.  Communication from the surgery about the changes could be better
Walton,Good but doesn't always run on time,4/24/2017,4,A good practice.  Doesn't always run on time but if I need to see a GP I can.  Locums are being used more lately to cover a specific doctor.  That surely doesn't save money.  I thought doctors from the other 2 surgeries would be covering.
Walton,Good but don't often run to time,4/24/2017,4,Often not running on time.  I always book online so that is easier to manage.  As the 'on the day 'team moves forward I do wonder how this will work with online booking.  They need to get the right information out via the online booking service so no confusion
Walton,Good but lack of continuity,4/5/2017,4,Lack of continuity - rarely see the same person
Walton,Good but long waits,4/18/2017,4,Have sometimes waited up to an hour after my appointment time.  They used to have a screen to inform you about waitning
Walton,Good but waits for appointments,4/18/2017,4,Surgery appointments never run on time.  A good surgery that usually gives me an appointment when I need one.  Sad to see my GP retire.  Hope they can get a permanent GP as locums are not a long term soution
Walton,Good care,6/5/2016,5,"Waiting times sometimes can be not so good. But as the care I receive is so good, I do not mind."
Walton,Good on the day service,4/24/2017,4,I used the @on the day team@ recently via this surgery for my daughter and it was good but I am concerned that bringing the time forward to 1 pm eventually may mean these appointments are harder to get
Walton,Good surgery overall,4/24/2017,4,Have used surgery quite a bit as have  children.  Tend to avoid a certain doctor as they mis-diagnosed 2 of my family years ago and they ended up in hospital.  Have used the ODT at the community hospital.  Went there about 3 pm and it is a good service.  I have to get the bus to get there but I don't mind
Walton,"Good, Can get appointment but want to see my own GP",4/24/2017,4,Just moved here and I like the surgery.  Can usually get appointment when need one but do not see the same GP which can be off putting to me
Walton,"Good, can get appointment on the day",4/18/2017,4,With ongoing condition I like to see the same GP  - currently a regular locum.  Can get appointment on the day.  I did not know about the 'On the day team'.  It woud be difficult for me to get to the hospital.  I chose this surgery because it's local
Walton,Good. Staff friendly,4/24/2017,4,I like the practice as it is local.  Friendly staff and GPs though no continuuity.  Hope they get a permanent one at least that I can see ongoing
Walton,GP and Midwife,11/13/2019,5,Never had issues with booking my appointments and the staff are lovely.  Clinicians I see are very professional.  Nice to see same Midwife locally
Walton,GP hung up on us,2/25/2019,2,"My partner has moved in the last few weeks from this surgery to another in the area as he felt he was not listened to by a certain GP that he had to always spoken to.  The GP hung up on him after telling him to just take Ibuprofen, when he is in agony with his knee.  We were never told about physio self-referral until we moved surgery.  My partner now awaits a scan and possible surgery.  He is fit and healthy and plays a sport and works hard, not having his knee sorted has caused major knock on effects."
Walton,Great service,11/13/2019,5,"This is a great service all round.  Staff are great too.
Today for the clinic, it is running late, hence the 3* for that."
Walton,Great Staff,11/13/2019,5,The Health care at Walton surgery is excellent with great staff too.
Walton,Happy,11/13/2019,5,We as a family do not use the service very much but I have to say that we are happy with the service provided.
Walton,Happy with service,11/13/2019,5,I am happy with the service overall.  It just takes a while to get an appointment on the telephone system as it is.
Walton,Happy with the service,11/11/2015,5,The computers went down recently and I waited 1/2 hour for my appointment only to be told that I couldn't be seen as my results were on the computer and couldn't be accessed. Otherwise I'm happy with the service.
Walton,Hard to get appointment,11/13/2019,2,"Waiting on 'phone to get appointment and once you get through, No appointments left.  Getting to see a Doctor is very difficult"
Walton,Has changed for worse,1/13/2020,3,"Do not think this surgery meets people’s needs as it has become more and more difficult to get an appointment with a GP. With ‘personal’ issues that I prefer to see my own GP for as they know me, I’m annoyed that I have had to see someone I’ve never met before. It makes me uneasy and anxious."
Walton,Have been trying for 2 months for appointment,6/3/2019,1,Have an abnormal mole & can't get appointment for when I'm not working.
Walton,Helpful and understanding,11/13/2019,4,I have always found the surgery to be helpful and understanding even when needing an emergency appointment.  Great staff and pleased to be reminded of checks due etc. Well done!
Walton,I had great service from Dr and surgery,3/30/2019,5,When I needed the doctor he was there for me and when my wife had cancer she was given first class care.
Walton,Impossible to get an appointment.,8/3/2019,1,"Tried to get an appointment for my partner for a weeks time as he was away on business, explained the situation and they just said he would have to call on the morning and see if there was an appointment available.  No advanced booking allowed.  Then tried to offer an evening appointment which again I had to decline because they hadn't listen to my original request advising he was away for a week!!!! The receptionist are rude saying I wasn't listening to them and they had tried to offer a solution, not sure how he was supposed to make the evening appointment when not in  the country!!!!.  We ended up going to A&E upon his return"
Walton,Keep suggesting the same thing,11/13/2019,4,No need to suggest counselling needed for every appointment at 'Well-Being'.
Walton,Lack of continuity with GP's,4/24/2017,4,Do not see the same GP
Walton,Lady doctor,11/13/2019,4,The surgery overall is very good.  I just wish they could recruit or we could have access to the choice of a lady doctor.
Walton,Link up with other service terrible,10/29/2018,4,"They are running more than 20 minutes late today.  The link up between the hospital (Papworth) and surgery is terrible, when medication is needed for major heart issues.  We had to chase the surgery.  It has happened a few times now."
Walton,Medications conflict with conditions,10/29/2018,4,"The medication issued can sometimes conflict with other medical conditions.  It is only by doing my own research that I inform the GP that my partner should not have it.  For Example: A tablet linked with his heart condition was doubled, then doubled again.  It conflicted with my partners Dementia really badly.  The GP did not seem to know anything about it, it is like I am educating them."
Walton,Mixed experience,1/13/2020,4,"The service generally works ok when we need it, but we have our frustrations of which we have aired to them. Mainly it is to do with ringing in the morning and being 1st in queue but it taking 20-30 mins to get through. Well we spoke to them but felt it fell on deaf ears."
Walton,More needed to help the Deaf,11/13/2019,4,"The only downside is the 'Deaf Barrier'. No text service, and I cannot call to make appointments.  Need to do more to help Deaf."
Walton,Much improved,2/28/2019,4,Surgery looks much improved with the new floor and loos like the children's are is having a re-vamp.  Good to see a surgery constantly 'upgrading'.
Walton,Nearly impossible to book an appointment,1/15/2020,1,"I was on the phone this morning at 8 am on the dot when the practice opened to book an appointment with a particular GP. I was relieved to hear that I was only fifth in the queue, as I have not been able to get an appointment recently, they were always booked up when I phoned, and they would not let me book an appointment. When my turn came, the phone line went dead at their end. I had no choice but to call back, I phoned back immediately, only a few minutes past 8, unfortunately this put me at 33 in the queue. When I finally got through, I was told that all the appointments with the particular GP I wanted to see were booked up, that I would have to see a different GP or a nurse. I purposefully called today, at 8 am sharp in order to get that particular appointment, through no fault of my own, it was the practice's phone line, I was unable to get my appointment. In the time it took me to explain this situation, all of the other appointment slots with other practitioners were booked up, and now I am left stranded with nothing but tears. This place has lost its compassion and humanity. I have been a patient at this practice for almost ten years. It used to be fairly straightforward to get an appointment, and get the help my family and I needed. This has drastically changed in the recent years. We can no longer make appointments ahead of time, and it is virtually impossible to see a particular GP, which is very difficult for patients who feel more comfortable seeing particular health professionals. Asking to make an appointment with a particular person should not be too much to ask for, it never used to be. It is very easy to see how people fall though the cracks of this system, especially when they are at their most vulnerable and at their weakest."
Walton,Never had a problem.,6/13/2019,5,"Always received  appointment with the appropriate person, Had excellent care in emergency situations."
Walton,New Patient,11/13/2019,5,I am a new patient here and everyone so far in the process has been excellent.  Very welcoming and got me booked into the flu clinic quickly after registering
Walton,Nice surgery to visit,11/13/2019,5,"This surgery is a very good surgery and a nice one to visit.  It is pleasant inside and the staff are lovely if you need them for anything, nothing is too much trouble"
Walton,No GP in this morning,2/28/2019,4,I am seeing the Nurse Practitioner but would have liked to see a GP.  I understand from you that there is no GP in this morning.  Not sure how a surgery can run when no GP is on site during opening hours.
Walton,"No issue with the staff, but...",1/13/2020,3,"It is a broken system. This surgery among many others need more staff as it’s so difficult to see who you’d like. I can’t book online anymore.
The staff here are all lovely and I feel sorry for them."
Walton,No one in?!,2/28/2019,3,"Due to an ongoing condition I have always been told by my GP to come to the surgery if I am struggling (Asthma related).  I was having a bad time of it and so came over to the surgery at about 3 pm to ask for help.  I was told there was no one in and I that I need to ring 111. How can there be 'no one in?' The surgery was open and the car park was full.  I was not told about GP+. I was livid, it never used to be like this."
Walton,No problems,11/13/2019,5,Overall the surgery is very good.  I get to see someone when I need to and the staff throughout are lovely
Walton,No problems,11/13/2019,4,I have never experienced any problems at Walton surgery.  They are always very helpful
Walton,No problems,11/13/2019,5,Generally this surgery suits all mine and my families needs.  It is a good service overall and has been today for the flu clinic too.
Walton,Not consistent,2/28/2019,3,"Depends on who you see here to what kind of treatment you get. Things are not as consistent as I'd like, I want to be able to trust whoever I see."
Walton,Not impressed,6/17/2019,3,"This surgery used to be very good before they were taken over.
Now,it is impossible to get an appointment with a proper doctor.
When I do get to see someone,I am kept waiting even though the waiting room is, invariably empty ??
Recently tried to see a doctor but was told that there were no appointments available.
Three days later I was taken to A& E  by ambulance after having collapsed at home.
It is a good thing that the paramedics are so good otherwise I don’t like to think what 
could have been !!!"
Walton,Not taken seriously,5/3/2019,3,"Do not feel like I am being taken seriously.  Been fobbed off since 9 2018 with young child who had ongoing cough.  Find receptionists patronising. As my child is under 4 years old, I know they should be seen, but reception say they don't need to be."
Walton,not very user friendly reception,7/12/2019,1,"is hit and miss with the services only one person is able to take blood from me others treat me like a pin cushion, ongoing problems are a matter of fact in the monitoring of them, i am seriously consideing leaving this surgery and finding one that cares"
Walton,Organised today,11/13/2019,3,It is very well organised for the flu clinic today.  Moved the chairs so you are pointing towards direction of the room you are going to for the jab.
Walton,Personal questions by people you know,2/28/2019,4,"Not keen in a small community being asked extra questions by a member of staff who we know in our lives.  I only know now that I can say something is 'private/confidential'. I know why they have to ask the questions, but just does not work for all in such a close knit community."
Walton,Polite and caring,11/13/2019,5,Staff always polite and efficient.  Doctors caring and explain in detail.
Walton,Poor,1/29/2019,1,"Cancelled 3 appointments for my granddaughters 8 week jabs, newest excuse is no nurses in the week. Last weeks excuse was vaccine didn't turn up. The father has now taken off 3 days from work to go with his daughter and lost pay as he's self employed. Very poor surgery planning. I'd tell people to go elsewhere."
Walton,Poor care,5/1/2019,1,I called doctors as was very poorly and not sure if I should go to hospital it was arranged that doctor would call me back that morning I did not receive call so chased up after lunch I finally got a call at 2.30 pm to be told he could not help on the phone no appointments and to call 111. He called back and finally offered an appointment at 6 pm. I am now recovering from a major operation to remove a large tumor from my bowel.
Walton,Poor treatment,1/11/2016,2,"Following a fall my doctor referred on to physio.  I saw the physio quite quickly but he hadn't seen the x-rays.I was given exercises to do but this did not help.  I then went to the department at the hospital (I've had ops previously) and was seen. My doctor could not refer.  I needed to see the physio.  Finally, after being lost in the system, I was given a scan and have been operated on as I had a fracture"
Walton,Professional,11/13/2019,5,I have alway found everyone across the service to be helpful and professional
Walton,Repeat prescription service is good,7/3/2019,4,"The repeat prescription service is very fast.
They say to give 5 days but usually I can pick up my medication from Morrisons in 1-2 days from when the repeat request was submitted."
Walton,Retired GP was great,10/29/2018,4,"I no longer see same GP which is ok, but I did find the previous GP, who has now retired excellent with his 'old School' care.  I was referred very quickly and have non-curable illness, so continuity would be preferable, as I now pick up more thing that I need to see a GP for. I feel I have to repeat myself a lot, an the empathy is not there as they do not know the history.  I should settle down as I believe there are now more 'permanent' members of the team."
Walton,Running behind as usual,10/29/2018,3,"Appointments run behind most times.  Up to an hour.  There is no one communicating with you why.  They could utilise the screen.  
Phone calls - Abrupt staff as ask you questions of why you want to see a GP.  How they ask it could be nicer.  It comes across quite aggressive how it is put."
Walton,"Running late, I will be late for work",10/29/2018,3,"Today I got an 'on the day' appointment. I booked it in good time to link up with getting to work.  However, it is running more than 25 minutes late, so I will be late for work."
Walton,Seeing Nurse instead,2/28/2019,4,"I do not need the surgery very much, but today when I called I got an appointment with the Nurse easily although felt seeing GP would be needed.  We will see if it was appropriate."
Walton,Slipped slightly since take over,11/13/2019,3,I feel that the surgery has slipped slightly since the Federation took over.  Very difficult to get an appointment (I am at a flu clinic today).
Walton,Surgery changed recently,5/3/2019,3,Surgery seems to have changed recently quite a bit.  Nurse who has been here a long time left and today there is no GP here.  Feels wrong.  I am here to see the Nurse Practitioner who is very good.
Walton,Talk to me respectfully,11/13/2019,4,With my extra support needs the surgery are excellent.  They talk to me respectfully in a way that I understand.
Walton,Terrible Experience,4/15/2019,1,"Incorrect medication given by a nurse practitioner. Ended up back there the next day seeing a proper GP. We don't want to see a nurse practitioner. Why can't the reception staff understand that. Did they offer reimbursement for the wrong prescription NO. This surgery is getting worse, the reception staff are extremely rude, they don't need to know my medical issue. Why are appointments not loaded on to the online system."
Walton,the 'System on line' the way ahead?,3/16/2019,2,"The service I receive at Walton surgery is in my opinion First class and  I was encouraged to register with the system on line booking service which was initially brilliant.,
I could choose who I wanted to see on a regular basis,the day and time but it seems to have failed as we are now back to the 90's having to phone up at 8 am to be told that there are no appointments for a doctor,
I thought by using the new 'system' I could book in advance but there has not been a doctors appointment on there since before xmas 2018,"
Walton,Treat you with respect,11/13/2019,4,"I find receptionists are sometimes very helpful, sometimes not.  Most Doctors treat one with respect and listen to whatever issues with care."
Walton,Treated well,11/13/2019,5,I have always been treated well here.  Only suggestion is that water in the waiting room would be helpful.
Walton,Trouble booking appointment,11/13/2019,2,"Receptionists are extremely rude!! I had awful trouble booking an appointment for contraceptive advise - as a result, I had to visit another site - 6 weeks later!! Absolutely ridiculous appointment booking system, very unhelpful for me as a full-time worker."
Walton,Trying to get a repeat prescription.,6/3/2019,2,"Although the practioners are excellent, the support staff, although helpful seem incapable of doing simple tasks like adding a new regular prescription to my Pharmacy2u account. I have never had a reply to an Email, so have ended up visiting in desperation."
Walton,Unable to get an emergency appt,7/1/2020,1,"Rang surgery at exactly 8.00 put on hold for 50 minutes. 
Told no apps anywhere despite telling ""call navigator"" I was having breathing difficulties. No advice given -just to and ring try again at 8.00 tomorrow!"
Walton,Very intentive,1/5/2019,5,"I had tendonitis in my leg saw the gp who gave me an all over inspection,  then straight through to physio very happy an recovered well"
Walton,Very satisfied,11/13/2019,5,I am very satisfied with the service here.  No complaints about anything.  They provide an excellent service always when I need it.
Walton,Wanted an appt with a doctor,11/2/2019,1,"Seemed a good plan to see a doctor before becoming an emergency - not possible unless I 'phone continuously first thing in the morning and I might get lucky.  That could well be impossible or too late, or possibly no appt available.  I'll hope for the best."
Walton,We have moved away from this surgery,7/3/2019,2,"I rang 45 times between 8-8.30am. When I finally got through there were no appointments left and no alternative was offered.
We are now moving surgeries."
Walton,What is going on at our friendly practice,12/14/2018,3,"As someone with a chronic illness I have been a regular visitor to this practice for decades. Since they have been taken over they are steadily going downhill. I object to being asked the reason for my visit when I phone for an appointment. This surely is between me and my Doctor. Also staff are leaving, I now hear that the practice nurse who has been there for close to 20 years has left. She was brilliant. Why did she leave? Something or someone is wrong at this once fabulous Surgery. It needs to be sorted out before it deteriorates further. I feel very angry about what is happening to this once model Surgery."
Walton,What is the point of this surgery,8/8/2019,1,"Having called 111 early morning Monday advised I needed to see my GP, spent 25 minutes from 0800 trying to get through only to be told by a rude and uncaring receptionist once I finally got through that there were no appointments and I would need to call back Tuesday morning and try again but there was no guarantee I would get an appointment the following day,I ended up in A&E. Had i been offered an appointment for the Tuesday I may have felt reassured and not gone to A&E.  This wss on top of a appointment a couple of weeks early with the nurse who is new. She didnt have a consultation with me but dictated to me what i should and should not be doing regarding the pill. The total lack of care or consideration of the patient by the reception staff is appaulling, they should remember that it is the patient who pays their wages and should show respect and compassion to those in need. The surgery should be ashamed of themselves at the total shambles it has become."
Walton,Works fine for me,5/3/2019,5,When I need the service all works fine for me.  I only really access the service a couple times a year.
Walton,Works well for me,2/28/2019,5,Works well for me when I need it.  Some times I book online but if nothing there I ring and get an appointment easily
Wickham,Above and beyond expectations.,5/2/2021,5,"Timely telephone call to my father to support him, checking and caring for him while his wife is in hospital. His phone call gave my father the courage to accept carer help and investigate more help he may need."
Wickham,Accessing a GP is near on impossible,11/13/2019,4,"After seeing a nurse practitioner 3 times but wanting to see a GP I knew my condition was very bad, I ended up in hospital with heart issues for 6 weeks. This was not picked up by the nurse practitioner, accessing a GP is near on impossible."
Wickham,Afraid to talk in waiting room,4/26/2018,4,It is an above average service. The Waiting room could be a bit 'less quiet'. You are almost aftaid to talk as it carries so easily.
Wickham,Always been good,7/12/2018,5,I have always found the service good as I can get 'on the day' and advanced appointments here. I do see the nurses a lot and a GP when it is needed. I even see the same GP which again I feel is excellent.
Wickham,Always get an appointment when needed,12/11/2019,5,"Always get an appointment when needed, though cannot see my own GP as they do not work everyday now."
Wickham,Always worked well for me,12/11/2019,5,"Always worked well for me. GP is part time so have to wait quite some time to see them, but do not mind as I know they are good and in high demand!"
Wickham,Appointment cancelled,11/13/2019,3,"Appointment was cancelled due to nurse illness. It was re-booked, but I had taken half a day off work which I don't get paid for. Have never been offered a GP + appointment."
Wickham,Appointment system,1/30/2018,4,"Overall this practice is good, but getting an appointment 'on the day' is getting more difficult"
Wickham,Appointment today,2/5/2023,4,I always managed to see who I need to within a few days of calling the surgery. It is good that you can get appointments this way and not only 'on the day' ones. It is noticeably quieter in the waiting room now since things started back up again. It is a feeling of mixed messages.
Wickham,Appointments take a week,5/8/2016,4,"I do not like being asked by reception what is wrong with me. If I was not ill enough to need to see a doctor I would not call. It can take a week to get an appointment, which is not good when you cannot plan when you are ill"
Wickham,Asthma check delay,9/23/2022,4,"We have a good service here, but there has been delays with my asthma check. I had one by telephone last year and fortunately had a peak flow meter myself. This years one, I was seen face to face, which is good for this kind of check."
Wickham,Asthma review,6/16/2023,4,Very good ongoing treatment and care as I have multiple conditions. My only gripe is that my asthma reviews have been over the telephone which I feel are not as thorough. I am due another one soon so I am going to try and push for a face to face one if they do not offer that.
Wickham,been cared for very well at the practice,2/3/2021,5,"excellent knowledgable  nurse practitioners, friendly motivated administration staff, thorough doctors who listen"
Wickham,Behind today,6/16/2023,4,"Normally excellent but running 30 mins behind today when it is only first thing. I had a 9am app and you get 30 mins free in the carpark, so had to go and put money on it now, hoping I do not get called whilst doing so! Booked this 2 weeks ago, so it's good that you have that facility rather than only being able to access things on the day."
Wickham,Blood tests at surgery,12/20/2018,4,"I can get an appointment for the blood tests in good time. If not they would say that I need to go to the hospital, which would, for me, be more difficult as transport is difficult. But I have used the service there.  It is just less convenient."
Wickham,Book well in advance,12/20/2018,4,"1.  Sometimes I have to book well in advance to see the doctor of my choice.
2.  Announcements sometimes are impossible to hear -- distortion wise-- poor for patients with hearing loss
3. No real information on display about services nearby such as patient transport"
Wickham,Brilliant,1/22/2016,5,Its a brilliant surgery
Wickham,Brilliant Surgery,2/20/2021,5,"Lately I've been involved with the surgery more than normal.
I have always been called back and was seen by a gp.
Any medication needed is always prompt.
Always treated with kindness and respect."
Wickham,Brilliant surgery!,10/20/2021,5,I have been with this practice for several years and always found the service to be great but over the past two years of my serious illness they have been amazing! All the staff are so kind and supportive and very professional. I can't speak highly enough about this practice particularly during these difficult covid times! thank you!
Wickham,Brusk receptionists,2/5/2019,4,"I do find some receptionists quite brusk. It is not what they say, it is how they say it. You tell them a day you cannot do and that's the day they offer or say ""well, you can't have one then""!"
Wickham,Can find it difficult to travel over to WMKT,12/11/2019,4,Can find it difficult to travel over to Wickham Market. Rendlesham is very part-time and we have had more and more people move into the area into new houses so demand is higher. Can get anxious so find it a bit difficult. Now aware of Econsult as an option.
Wickham,Cannot fault surgery,9/14/2018,5,I really cannot fault the surgery.  I have been coming here for many years and feel fortunate we have such a good service
Wickham,Carpark limit issues,7/18/2023,4,"If the surgery is running behind you have to end up paying for parking as it has a 30 minute limit. This can be an issue, as you assume you will be seen within 5-10 mins of your appointment time. If you are not you are then in a dilemma about running out to put parking on the car and hope you are then not called in. Everyone is lovely and I always get an appointment if I need one face to face."
Wickham,Consistently good,2/5/2019,4,Been at surgery many years and it has been consistently good. Can get appointment when need one. In today with partner who is seeing a nurse practitioner. We called this morning and we thought we needed to see a GP. We understand that we have to follow a system and I am sure if a GP is needed they will call one through or make another appointment.
Wickham,Consistently good,12/20/2018,5,I have been under this health practice for 20 plus years.  The service is always consistently outstanding in my experience.
Wickham,Couldn't cancel appointment,12/10/2022,2,"I needed to cancel my appointment and can only use the telephone. Appointment was at 9:30 I was ringing from 8:00 - 9:15 and couldn't get through. I hate not turning up! I cannot use online, so I suggest there is a cancellation option you can choose that you leave a message on if they cannot pick it up."
Wickham,Delay in 'checks',7/22/2022,4,"I have had a couple of repeat blood tests recently and they book you in pretty quickly. It is convenient for me to come here rather than travel elsewhere for that .
My 'MOT' seems to get later each year. It is supposed to be around my birthday, but it has been 1 month late and this one is 7 months late. I understand the other one being late, due to COVID and catching up."
Wickham,Delayed referral,12/20/2018,4,"I felt my referral was severely delayed as I kept seeing a nurse practitioner and not a GP, as I kept requesting for almost a year.  When I finally saw a GP+ Doctor, who ironically works here they said I have been waiting far too long and they referred me immediately.  I am now under the hospital having ongoing treatment."
Wickham,Difficult to get appointment when working FT,11/13/2019,4,With working full time it can be extremely difficult to get an appointment.
Wickham,Doctor is interested and actually talks to me,1/22/2016,5,I like my doctor because turns around and talks to you. You feel they are interested and wants to get to the root of the problem.
Wickham,Efficient service,2/5/2019,4,Efficient service. In and out quite quickly. Running a little behind today. Good bedside manner though.
Wickham,Excellent,12/1/2017,5,Saw pharmacist at 4.30 pm.  Told to see doctor asap.  Arrived at surgery at 4.50 pm to make an appointment as I was going away.  Seen immediately by nurse; advised not as serious as thought. Treatment prescribed.  Now back and virtually cleared up.  AMAZING
Wickham,Excellent,11/24/2016,5,Always caring.  Cannot fault them
Wickham,excellent,9/14/2017,5,Friendly staff.  Always seen same day & take time & care over diagnosis
Wickham,Excellent,5/2/2016,5,The surgery keep you informed if running late which is great.  A good mix of male and female doctors.
Wickham,Excellent all the time,7/18/2023,5,"I have been here many years and I have found the service to be excellent the whole time. I get seen by the right person in a reasonable amount of time. Usually run on time too, which helps with parking"
Wickham,Excellent but hard to get appointment,3/20/2017,5,Waiting a long time to get an appointment
Wickham,Excellent care,2/5/2019,4,Always received excellent care from practice.
Wickham,Excellent care,3/20/2017,5,Excellent care here.  I cannot fault them.
Wickham,Excellent Customer Care/Service,1/1/2016,5,"We moved to Wickham Market 14 months ago and have required medical help on a fairly frequent basis due to our ages during this period of time.  We cannot praise the team enough.  I went to see a doctor in December for severe abdominal pains and had an ultrasound on my liver and kidneys, had seen an urology consultant at Ipswich Hospital, with diagnosis - all by the end of the month!!  The speed and professionalism of this NHS was superb - just what is required when you are anxious about your health and not knowing what the problem might be.  Thank you to the whole team."
Wickham,Excellent response to any contacts,1/18/2022,5,"All staff (including reception) are responsive, efficient and knowledgeable.  From a major issue to requiring travel vaccinations the service has impeccable."
Wickham,Expected to be able to view test results etc.,7/23/2019,2,"Cant see the point of the online service if we still have to see a doctor to find out routine test results
Would prefer to see online to alleviate the need to visit or call surgery"
Wickham,Fantastically friendly and efficient,2/19/2021,5,"Call answered in very quickly, asked to register on their website, called me back in 5 mins and the lady and was registered with the surgery. Thank you so very much, best wishes for your good health."
Wickham,Friendly and helpful,2/5/2019,4,"Well explained, good examination. Friendly and helpful."
Wickham,Frustrating getting through on the day,9/14/2018,4,Only thing I get frustrated about is trying to get an appointment on the day.  I usually have to wait about 1-2 weeks to see someone.  I usually have to call when I am at work so can't call right at the beginning of the day.
Wickham,Generally full marks,6/22/2016,4,"Generally speaking, I give this surgery full marks in every area of my experience, including waiting times. On this occasion however, my GP was running 35 minutes late - so room for improvement! Otherwise I cannot fault this wonderful surgery"
Wickham,"Generally works well, sometimes a bit delayed",2/5/2019,4,"In the main, things work well here. Sometimes it can run behind time but you can understand that, within reason."
Wickham,Get to see same GP,12/11/2019,5,Get to see same GP but happy to see anyone if ill on the day. (Econsult and online bookings)
Wickham,Good,10/16/2017,4,Good GPs and NHS specialist
Wickham,Good at sending reminder texts,7/18/2023,5,"This is a great surgery, the staff are good and polite and patient on the telephone. They are good at sending text reminders and I appreciate that. No complaints just positive comments."
Wickham,Hard to speak with a doctor,5/14/2021,1,Every time I contact the surgery I get put down for a Nurse practitioner to give me a call back. I have requested a Doctor specifically due to various complex health problems but am advised that the GP will decide who they will speak to and the  nurse always says I will need to check with the GP. I am fed up and probably will not be a patient of this practice much longer. I cannot fault one or two members of staff who have been excellent and understand the frustration I feel.
Wickham,Helpful and polite,9/23/2022,5,"Excellent service when ever I have needed it. Reception are extremely helpful and polite, which is important to me."
Wickham,Helpful for urgent blood test,12/11/2019,4,"My partner needed an urgent blood test as stated by the GP, the service had no availability and the form did not have urgent written on it but thankfully the receptionist knew us well and she squeezed us in. Ordinarily we would have had to have gone to A & E as he was that unwell. We felt the forms should be either in a different colour to show the urgency or should be written on so it is clear."
Wickham,Information not forthcoming,9/14/2018,4,"I found that when it came to talking over anything, the information wasn't very forthcoming.  Felt I had to press them to get any proper explanation."
Wickham,It is the best,1/22/2016,5,"It is the best surgery I have ever been to. All the staff I come in to contact with are great, I'd give them 12 stars"
Wickham,It works for me,2/5/2019,4,"Been here only twice in the last year. It works for me, but I have not 'fully tested' the system."
Wickham,Lovely people,7/18/2023,4,"The staff are lovely people. The only thing I would change, is to have something playing in the background in the waiting area, as it does feel super quiet."
Wickham,More flexible attitude from reception staff,3/15/2016,3,At times it is like the reception staff are there to prevent people seeing their doctor and they don't take your history in to account. It would be great if they had a more flexible attitude.
Wickham,My GP only works one day per week now,12/11/2019,5,"My GP only works one day per week now so I have quite a wait when I need to see them, its due to an ongoing issue that its preferred. However if I am ill and need 'on the day' appointment I am happy to see anyone."
Wickham,No issues,7/10/2018,5,"Never had issues and do not want to move from here as we need to move house soon. I am trying to find a place nearby so can ensure we stay under this service.
I had an advanced booking for this appointment today, which was needed."
Wickham,Not enough staff,2/5/2019,3,"Overall average surgery as over time things here have just got more pressurised with more people using the services and not enough staff. Here to see HCA for warfarin bloods today which I have done every 1-2 months. They see me in good time for that. With so many medical conditions I would like to see the same GP, otherwise I have to keep explaining myself."
Wickham,Not sure of value but they are good with me,2/5/2019,4,"Been a few times here, which is convenient. Not sure what good it will do as my back muscles need a lot of strengthening and that's a very long job. But I am in so much pain as it is difficult to keep them up. 
They are very thorough and good with me, but feel it would be better if i could use some kind of pulsing system. The positions for the stretches and exercises are difficult to get into."
Wickham,"Phlebotomy on site, great",9/14/2018,5,Having Phlebotomy service here is excellent. It is always running on time.  Always feel they look after you well
Wickham,Physio is convenient,2/5/2019,5,"Have been a couple of times since my back surgery, convenient to come to Wickham Market rather than have to go back into hospital."
Wickham,Practically perfect practice,5/8/2016,5,I have no complaints. For 50 plus years I have used this surgery and had the same doctor for many years now who I get to see most the time as they work full-time. I have no issues and can only praise the service
Wickham,Professional and businesslike.,10/15/2021,3,"Over the years I have always received good care although, understandably, things have drifted somewhat since the pandemic started. Follow ups and referrals seem to have slowed to a standstill.  My only criticism is that consultations could have been more friendly and customer sympathetic.  There is a time for lightness in face to face or phone consultations. It doesn't have to be full on all the time. In fairness some practitioners are more user friendly than others."
Wickham,Quickly seen for blood test today,12/11/2019,5,"Quickly seen for blood test today, as urgent, so came over from Rendlesham. Fortunately we drive but those that cannot drive find it difficult. The GP's have been excellent getting us in for chest X-ray, which means we get quick diagnosis."
Wickham,Referral very good,9/14/2018,4,My GP is excellent in referring me for help with fertility treatment. It was the hospital that were not brilliant
Wickham,Referral wait was short,2/5/2019,4,First visit. Didn't take too long from my referral to get appointment which is good. Really convenient to come here I was given the choice of venues to go to and chose here.
Wickham,Reliably good response to calls,8/29/2020,5,"Excellent response from reception, quick call back from a GP with helpful advice. Its and excellent way to run the surgery at the moment though we hope one day to return to face to face appointments when needed"
Wickham,Ring in rather than online,7/22/2022,5,"I prefer to ring in now after my one and only experience trying to use E-Consult. I found it just sent 'around the houses', never feeling I was getting anywhere. If I was using it wrong, then it shows it is too complicated as I am pretty IT savvy. Today, I called at 8:05, but had to try later due to school run. When I rang again after that we still got an appointment, which is great, for my child. I did not expect them to have anything left, so that was excellent that they did."
Wickham,Routine easy to get,7/18/2023,5,"All routine blood test appointments are easy to get. They are really good as the last time I came, they could not get enough, so they rebooked and gave advice on how to help. This informed the hospital by 6 pm the next day when they then contact me to adjust my medication if need be.  It is very convenient to come in here to get it done as it is currently needed quite regularly."
Wickham,See same GP,12/20/2018,5,"If I am willing to wait a while, I do get to see my own GP which I do not mind.
Appointments are running rather late today."
Wickham,Seen quickly,12/20/2018,5,"Last week I was seen really quickly when I experienced sudden illness whilst out at the shops.  If they hadn't been able to see me, the shop was going to get an ambulance.  I would have ended up at A&E, waiting much longer to see someone, and ended up with the same medication as I got from the surgery.  I am grateful that they got me in.  It is also local so my family were able to get to me easily and quickly as I needed driving home afterwards."
Wickham,"Service good, particularly with mental health",12/11/2019,5,"Service has been very good, particularly with my mental health. Saw Link Worker and from there had session with Wellbeing which has helped me no end."
Wickham,Service has been excellent of late,11/13/2019,4,"Apart from last year when we had an issue with misdiagnosis everything since then has been excellent. In relation to this time ended up in A & E with infection Grommet in ear, surgery said it was just that it had moved and may soon fall out."
Wickham,Service is excellent and caring,12/11/2019,5,"We called first thing and got an appointment straightaway (10 ish), so I find the service excellent and caring."
Wickham,Some doctors better than others,2/5/2019,3,Some doctors have zero 'bedside manner' and it lets the rest of the team down. But some are amazing and give 5* treatment.
Wickham,Such a professional well run practice,2/16/2021,5,"Even had GP come out today to give us Covid-19 jab , it can’t be easy running a big practice, but you guys do a great job"
Wickham,Tannoy not clear,12/20/2018,4,"The use of the Tannoy is a constant issue.  It is just not very clear.
I cannot wait more than a week for an appointment if I want see my own GP.  It is not acceptable.  
I put it down to the fact that we have had many new people move into the area with the new houses, however there has been no new GP's."
Wickham,Telephone manner could be better,12/20/2018,4,"Can get appointment when I need one.  Staff on reception could be more welcoming, both in telephone manner and when you come in."
Wickham,The Nurse Practitioner gave excellent service,6/8/2015,5,Removal of stitches in my head at. Rendlesham Surgery
Wickham,They don't seem to know what to suggest,10/3/2016,4,I've visited three time in the last week and they don't really know what to do so advised me to come to A&E. Previously however they have been very good and advised well.
Wickham,Took me seriously,1/16/2019,4,"I went to my GP because I had lost weight and thought I might be anaemic. My GP took me seriously and ordered several blood tests, one of which was a PSA test. My result for this was slightly abnormal, so it was repeated twice at monthly intervals. Although it was still only slightly above normal , my GP decided to refer me to the hospital for further investigations."
Wickham,Trustworthy and respectful,9/3/2021,5,I find that Wickham Market Medical Centre is always reliable. It is easy to set up a call back from my doctor with the ever helpful and patient receptionists. It has been a lifeline during the Covid 19 pandemic.
Wickham,Very efficient and thorough,5/18/2015,5,"Having moved from a big town in Essex to a small market town in Suffolk, I am extremely impressed with the facilities provided here. 8 or 9 GP's, dedicated nurses for different clinics, phlebotomist, nurse practitioner, dispensary, scanner unit. I needed a blood test and scan which both happened 3 days after being told to have them. Results back within 2 days. Lovely people with a human, kindly attitude."
Wickham,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"This surgery is very good. I see the same GP when I need a GP. This appointment was booked a month ago. They are running behind today and so had to go and put parking on the car, which is a bit frustrating. Be good to know that up front rather than having to pop out whilst waiting."
Wickham,Very good and very pleased,2/5/2019,4,Very good and very pleased. Able to get an appointment when need one and generally get to see the same GP
Wickham,Very good service,7/18/2023,5,"I use the telephone to book appointments and getting through in 10 minutes or so is not too bad.  They used to have the facility to book 'online' appointments, so I would like that back as it was very efficient. Seeing the Practice Nurse today who is the right person for me for this."
Wickham,Very Positive,7/13/2015,5,Making the appointment was simple. The staff were very helpful. The doctor was very supportive and a follow up appointment was made.
Wickham,Very supportive and understand my condition,12/17/2015,5,They are always there when you need them and I can always get an appointment.  They've been very supportive and understand my condition.
Wickham,Very thankful,4/28/2015,4,"Very thankful that when my husband was seen by a doctor at the W.M Surgery having been assessed as not having Alzheimer's at Ipswich Hospital, they re-referred him for a second opinion at Addenbrookes Memory Clinic who diagnosed Alzheimer's."
Wickham,Waiting room is quiet,9/14/2018,4,"When I need to see someone, I always do.  Only improvement I would make is the waiting room being so quiet and the doctors calling you through the speaker being so loud, it is muffled, so difficult to make it out.  The whole system needs looking at."
Wickham,Well looked after,1/22/2016,5,Always been well looked after
Wickham,Worst doctors surgery in Suffolk,2/2/2021,1,"None of the staff seem to know what they are on about, we are in a pandemic and instead of telling me they can't help me on the phone when they rung they made me come in to tell me as if i don't work and need to get the time off. They are useless, unhelpful and arrogant. They have the absolute worst mental health support, worst attitude of doctors and I will be moving doctors surgeries."
Woodbridge,4 star,7/10/2015,4,4 star
Woodbridge,4 star,5/8/2015,4,4 star.
Woodbridge,5 Star,9/16/2015,5,Excellent
Woodbridge,Always helpful staff.,12/5/2016,5,Always helpful staff who try their best to help you.
Woodbridge,"Apauling, better off losing my finger",11/20/2015,1,"I have been experiencing pain in ring finger.  When I went to my GP I wasn't listened to. GP typed my symptoms into the computer and literally read everything off this computer, the majority did not apply (wear a wrist splint).  The GP then asked if I had any medical conditions  (which if GP had read my records  then would have seen)  GP blamed thyroid + diabetes for  the pain and said I would have to have tests to check my levels.  I go to the diabetic clinic for tests, so the GP should have up to date records.  Anyway these tests were done and after they came back clear, the GP asked what I wanted done!  So after I said I want my hand checked by the hospital I finally got referred,  My pain has got worse and I still have not heard from the GP.

I know the hospital sent the results back to the GP but nothing has been done by the GP.

I had the test at the hospital in 9.  I called my GP to book an appointment for this, but there is a 2 week waiting list.  I am in a crazy amount of pain and no one is doing anything.  The DR's surgery is merged with another surgery however.  I am waiting even longer for an appointment.

I am half tempted to cut my finger off in order for someone to treat me. I won't do this but a shame nothing has yet been done."
Woodbridge,Appointments running late,4/29/2016,4,"It would be helpful to know in advance if appointments are running late. I waited 50 minutes, forewarning would be useful.

Regarding new medical centre:
Now it is bigger will more patients be taken on? This would make appointments more difficult. Will there be more parking and how will this work? Possibility of hospital users using the car park. Will parking be chargeable? Will there be extra services and better range of specialties?"
Woodbridge,appointments......,6/7/2016,4,Appointments...I work 9-5.0 and getting a non-emergency appointment means making several 'phone calls which is difficult from work.
Woodbridge,Appointmets easy to access.,7/23/2015,5,Appointments are easier to get since my husband has had more complex problems.
Woodbridge,Bad waiting times,9/16/2015,4,for any doctors on the day. Specific doctor -3 week wait!
Woodbridge,Better parking,6/7/2016,5,"Parking is poor here, I hope it will be better at 2 Rivers"
Woodbridge,can get appointment,6/5/2016,4,The premises could do with some attention. I find the staff not particularly welcoming. Waiting once you are there is quite unacceptable beyond 15-20 minutes
Woodbridge,can't always see same doctor,6/3/2016,4,I can't always see the same doctor after an initial appointment.
Woodbridge,Clinicians are good,6/7/2016,3,The clinicians are good but getting appointments is difficult. I hope my daughter will be able to see the same doctor at the new surgery-it will be easier for me to get to for me.
Woodbridge,Difficult to get an appointment,6/3/2016,5,If my child is sent home from school because he is ill it is very difficult to get an appointment that day.
Woodbridge,Difficult to get an appointment,4/29/2016,2,"it is difficult to get an appointment and since my named doctor left the practice I don't feel as well looked after.

Regarding new medical centre:
Will it be easier to get an appointment?
What will be the booking system?
When a second appointment is needed can it be with the same doctor?
Will there be parking and will I have to pay?"
Woodbridge,Difficult with young children,6/3/2016,5,Much is excellent about this practice but 20-30 minute waits on the day are difficult when i have sick/young children.
Woodbridge,For my children I can't fault it.,5/31/2016,4,"For my children I can't fault it, always seen on the day. For myself as an adult I can't see a consistent GP and there is a long waiting list."
Woodbridge,Getting appointments,7/9/2015,5,Getting an appointment can be a problem if you want to see a particular doctor - otherwise a really good surgery
Woodbridge,Good experience - reassuring,11/20/2015,4,I had a seizure at work.  As I had never had one before I went to GP on the same day.  I was given a thorough examination & given a hospital referral for November
Woodbridge,Happy with current practice,4/29/2016,5,I'm happy with the current practice.
Woodbridge,Hard to get an appointment,8/9/2016,3,So hard to get an appointment when you need one in a hurry
Woodbridge,hard to get an appointment,10/12/2015,3,"takes too long to get an appointment. when asked if the doctor could take an extra swab at the same time they said no, forcing me into making an appointment for a couple of months time. inefficient and poor parking available. they tell you tell the receptionist if you've kept waiting for more than 30 minutes after your appointment time but when you do report you just get told there's nothing they can do and for you to sit back down again. really poor service."
Woodbridge,He wasn't booked in,6/18/2016,2,due to the merger there was a mix up when my husband booed an appointment. He was given an appointment at Woodbridge Road but when got there he wasn't booked in!
Woodbridge,Long wait for appointment,4/29/2016,4,"Other than having to wait three weeks for appointment it's pretty good.I shouldn't have to say that I am an emergency to get an appointment.

Regarding new medical centre: Will appointments be easier? Need to speak to a person not computer so that priorities can be objectively determined."
Woodbridge,Long wait for appointments,4/29/2016,3,"There are long waits for appointments and delays in the waiting room. 

Regarding new medical centre:
Will there be more appointments?"
Woodbridge,Mostly excellent,6/12/2015,4,"Despite losing many long standing GPs recent admin changes and evolution towards merging with Lattice Barn have ensured patient focussed care is a priority. The practice actively seeks out patient views and opinions- and, more importantly works with those offering them. GP commissioning has given GPs more power and the surgery has used this wisely and effectively to help patients. Really impressed- and grateful. A real improvement over the past few years."
Woodbridge,No review - Only ratings provided,7/16/2015,4,No review - Only ratings provided
Woodbridge,Not keeping patients well informed,6/6/2016,5,We haven't had any information about the merger from our doctors. We had an issue when a new member of staff made an appointment for my husband but when he turned up the appointment was at the other surgery.
Woodbridge,Overall good,6/7/2016,5,Overall it is good but I can't see the same doctor twice and there is no follow up check to make sure everything is alright when medications are changed.
Woodbridge,Poor,10/10/2016,3,"Long waiting times, rude staff"
Woodbridge,Poor,9/30/2019,2,Waiting appointment times are horrendous.  I am moving surgeries
Woodbridge,Pretty good surgery,3/17/2016,5,"This is a pretty good surgery and I am well looked after, reception is a bit 'iffy' though."
Woodbridge,Quick appointments not available,4/29/2016,4,"It's not always possible to get an appointment today/tomorrow

Regarding new medical centre:
What are the parking arrangements and will there be a charge? Will there be quicker appointments? Will the doctors from both existing surgeries be available to all patients?"
Woodbridge,Quicker appointments needed.,7/16/2015,3,It would be better to get a GP appointment when I need it rather than 3 weeks later.
Woodbridge,Regarding new centre,4/29/2016,4,"The new centre is closer to me so that's good.
Will I be able to see the same doctor each time?
Will there be disabled access and a lift?"
Woodbridge,Regarding new centre,4/29/2016,4,I'm happy with the prospect of change.
Woodbridge,Regarding new centre,4/29/2016,4,"I currently have no problems with the existing practice.

Regarding new medical centre:
Will parking be better than at the current practice?"
Woodbridge,Regarding new medical centre,4/29/2016,4,"What extra services will be available at the new centre?
What parking options?
What will be the opening hours?"
Woodbridge,Regarding new medical centre,4/29/2016,3,Will it be easier to get an appointment at the new centre
Woodbridge,Spent 5 months getting a referral,10/12/2015,2,Saw GP in April. Had to wait 5 months before anything got done and continuous blood tests because the GP couldn't diagnose tennis elbow! Need to get more car parking as this can drive blood pressure up before even getting into the surgery
Woodbridge,Telephone call backs have gone,7/19/2016,4,"I liked their telephone callbacks, but these have gone now.  There is now a 2 week wait to see a specific doctor"
Woodbridge,Unsatisfactory.,12/5/2016,4,Dangerous car park. can't get through on the 'phone. Appointments sometimes a month ahead.
Woodbridge,Very good level of service from nurses or drs,1/5/2018,5,The nurses are absolutely lovely here and the drs are the same.  I have never had a problem getting an appointment for either myself or my son.
Woodbridge,Waiting is ridiculous,6/3/2016,2,Waiting list for appointments is ridiculous. Reception staff ask lots of personal questions over the phone. No other advice given if you need an earlier appointment.
Woolpit,A bit disappointed,9/17/2021,3,I'm a bit disappointed that getting a face to face appointment with a specific doctor is taking so long. I've had to re book the appointment as I didn't get the call back I was expecting so I have to wait another 2 weeks
Woolpit,A good doctors surgery,7/6/2023,4,"There are a good team of doctors here and all the staff do their utmost best.  The pharmacy does struggle with queues, however the 24/7 machine for dispensing medicines is an excellent idea and should help to alleviate some of the queues.  The Receptionists I have spoken to are helpful.
I think we need more doctors surgeries in the area. I feel this is why Woolpit Surgery is struggling as more people are using the surgery now as population increases due to increased new housing."
Woolpit,A good surgery,7/3/2019,5,It is a good surgery but may be not quite what it was pre pandemic. As the phones are busy I tend to pop down to the surgery to book an appointment rather than wait on the phone. The care and treatment though are very good.
Woolpit,A good surgery,12/13/2021,5,"The surgery is good, I use both phone and econsult to get appointments and it works really well for me depending on the situation."
Woolpit,A Good surgery,12/13/2021,5,I think they are doing a very good job and there are no issues. A mix of appointments have been available when I've needed them and it's all worked well. The Staff are good and the nurse was great at sorting out an injury to my hand so really can't fault the surgery.
Woolpit,A good surgery but very busy,12/14/2017,5,Tend to book appointments ahead of time to make sure I can see my doctor. A good surgery but very busy. The additional housing planned is a concern for the area and the ability of the surgery to cope with additional patients.
Woolpit,A great surgery,6/28/2022,5,"The way in which the surgery runs and organised is brilliant and the covid vaccinations that they did were great, really amazing how efficient it all was."
Woolpit,A jolly good surgery,6/18/2019,5,"I'd prefer to see the same doctor but the ones I do see are very supportive. 
Reception staff should be on reception at all times.
I'd like to see a clock in the waiting area.
When I raised and issue about being on warfrin the doctor really listened to me and decided to change me to something different. And when I've been given a different version of a medication if I don't get on with it they will always listen and change it back. 
It's helpful that they tell you when they are running late.
A jolly good surgery."
Woolpit,A very good surgery.,7/1/2019,4,"I am very pleased with the GPs.
Making an appointment is OK, but you do have to wait a while if you want to see your preferred GP.
Staff are obliging."
Woolpit,Abrupt but helpful receptionists,7/31/2015,4,Sometimes the receptionist can be a little abrupt but they always do what they can
Woolpit,Absolutely ridiculous pharmacy wait times,1/20/2023,1,Queues are long no matter what time of day you go and anywhere from 30 mins to an hour. Not sure how they expect disabled people to stand and wait that long. I don’t understand why they don’t use an online service?!
Woolpit,Access to doctors can be tricky,6/18/2019,3,"It has taken 4 weeks to get a general appointment an it's difficult to know whether an issues is an 'on the day issue' or not. Reception staff, at times, can be abrupt when you're trying to get an appointment and it can feel very 'gate keepery'. Doctors offer good patient care but there can be a bit of a wait to see a female doctor.
It would be great to know how many doctors are working and to be kept informed about longer delays with appointments.
There have been very positive changes made to the reception area."
Woolpit,All a bit difficult,12/13/2021,4,I'm finding it all a bit difficult at the moment as it takes a long time to get through on the phone but the doctors do always call you back and get things sorted out. Sometimes a face to face would be more reassuring.
Woolpit,All good,12/23/2022,4,Called this morning and had a call back quickly with a GP and now I'm seeing them. I was really happy with how the conversation went and how they listened to my concerns. I've found the system works well.
Woolpit,All good so far,12/23/2022,5,I'm a relatively new patient but staff have been good whenever I've had contact with the surgery. I've managed to get appointments with the nurse via reception and it's all been good so far.
Woolpit,All worked well,12/5/2022,4,I've had a mix of both phone and face to face appointments and all have worked well for the circumstances and addressed the issues I've had. I would like to see more face to face appointments more easily available but understand the current situation.
Woolpit,All works well,9/17/2021,5,"I really like the surgery and have no issues getting an appointment when it's needed. I've had telephone consultations and face to face appointments and it's all worked well, suiting the situation and staff have continually been great. The Covid vaccination programme that was run near by went really well, a well oiled machine!"
Woolpit,Always happy with NHS staff and services,4/19/2023,4,Hard pressed staff do their best and should be respected
Woolpit,Always have a house visit when needed,5/25/2017,4,If I need a house visit they always come.  If I do want to see my own doctor it may mean more of a wait but I can always see another doctor if it's urgent.  Overall a good surgery
Woolpit,Always helpful,1/21/2016,5,Always helpful and able to get an appointment. Staff are all very friendly.
Woolpit,Amazing care,10/16/2017,5,Having collapsed in the surgery I was given the most amazing care until the paramedics arrived to take me to A & E
Woolpit,Amazing new car park,12/13/2021,4,Really pleased with the new car park it is amazing and the maternity care from the surgery has been really good too.
Woolpit,Annoyed with pharmacy times for medication.,7/2/2023,3,I asked for medication before I went for a blood test.  I then had to wait for it to finished being dispensed. I understand times have been trying but this is getting bad.  The rest of the surgery is great but pharmacy is letting you down.
Woolpit,Appointments easy to get,12/23/2022,4,Do see different doctors but the care and treatment is good. Its a very busy surgery and I'm concerned about the amount of new housing. The check in computer and the notification panel aren't currnetly working and the latter would help when patients are being called as it's quite difficult to hear names being called with the acoustics in the waiting room.
Woolpit,Been good,10/12/2021,4,Generally the surgery has been good for appointments and the new car park is a real bonus. The covid vaccinations days here have been amazingly well organised and such a simple process.
Woolpit,Best surgery,9/17/2021,5,"This is the best surgery I've been to. Family were staying recently and had an issue but they called the surgery and medication was arranged for them really quickly.The triage system is also working well for us, there are no negatives at all."
Woolpit,Brilliant,12/13/2021,5,"Its a brilliant surgery, the new car park is great. The pharmacy staff are really wonderful and the doctors and other staff are amazing. The only slight issue is how long it takes to get through on the phone but I've been seen quickly when I've needed to be this morning."
Woolpit,Busy phones,12/23/2022,4,The phones are busy but I haven't needed to use the surgery much. I waited 30 minutes to get through this time. Very happy with staff whenever I've seen them and the nursing staff are lovely. Housing developments locally are a concern.
Woolpit,Busy phones,6/7/2022,4,"There are long queues on the phone, but if you pick your time to call it can be better. The care navigators are very good and I have no problems letting them know the issue I'm calling about as it gets me the right help. If they are concerned the doctor calls you back and an appointment is avaiable the same day.  If the issue is not urgent there are 3-5 week waits at times to be seen.  I do feel that the after service is a little lacking. I have several issues that I'm worried about but I've not had any real explanation from the doctor about them. I'm not sure about test results as they haven't been explained either, it would be nice to have someone explain what I should expect and to get some feedback."
Woolpit,Busy phones,12/13/2021,4,"Phones are incredibly busy in the mornings, I was 5th in the queue and it took 25 minutes to get through, my wife was 29th and gave up. We have had appointments over the phone and they have worked well so far."
Woolpit,Busy phones,10/12/2021,4,Getting an appointment is a bit of a struggle as so busy on the phones and I haven't really found econsult helps very much unfortunately. You do get to talk to a GP and be invited in if its needed.
Woolpit,Call backs are quick,4/5/2022,4,The call backs from the doctors are really quick but they do mean you do not always get to see a doctor face to face when it is sometimes needed. Mental health support has been a little lacking and it has taken a while to be taken seriously and a referral to be made.
Woolpit,Called the telephone and waited 85 mins.,11/4/2023,1,"I called to discuss a specific issue regarding my repeat prescription and firstly waited 85 mins then 35 mins, both times there was no answer even when I got down to first in line.  I hung up and was immediately 7th in line - there is something wrong with your system.  You are always great when I finally get through ;-)"
Woolpit,Can always get an appointment,2/26/2020,5,You can always get an appointment but you do have to wait 1-2 weeks if you want a specific doctor. The car park is too small. I think there should be a water dispenser for patients.
Woolpit,Can hear everything in the waiting room,12/23/2022,4,"They are doing all they can in very difficult circumstances but when I've needed them they have always been there and I've been able to get appropriate treatment.  Staff are wonderful but the privacy in the waiting room is virtually zero and you can hear everything that is being said, although hearing your name being called is difficult. It would be helpful for the sign showing the next patient to work, it would help a lot."
Woolpit,Can take time to get through,9/17/2021,4,"You can get appointments but it is a little frustrating at times trying to get through to the surgery on the phone. To see a specific doctor can take some time but that's to be expected at the moment, care though is very good no matter who you see."
Woolpit,Can usually see same GP,2/5/2019,5,"The consistency of the same GP is important - I can do that here usually. They are always spot on with diagnosing and deal with issues swiftly. 
Pharmacy - there is often a long wait for medication. 
Car park can be difficult, not enough spaces.
Quality of people recruited is high, medical and non-medical staff."
Woolpit,Can’t fault them,1/18/2022,5,"Every time I’ve needed to go they’ve always helped me out incredibly, got nothing bad to say about them, all good experiences"
Woolpit,Cannot speak more highly of them,7/10/2015,5,Very pro-active and cannot speak more highly of them.
Woolpit,Can't fault the service,4/5/2022,5,"I had an appointment last week and saw a doctor, the doctor then called and arranged xrays, bloods and physio which was great. I can't fault the practice, they are very supportive but wish we could have just one doctor to see as I feel it would be beneficial."
Woolpit,Can't fault the surgery,6/7/2022,4,I can't fault the surgery at all they are all very good and in particular the nurses are wonderfully caring.
Woolpit,Can't get a physical appointment,9/27/2022,3,"I do spend a long time on the phones waiting to get through, and I cannot easily get a physical appointment."
Woolpit,Car park amazing,10/12/2021,5,There are longish waits on the phone to get through to the reception team but generally the care provided is very good and I really can't fault the surgery. The new car park is amazing!
Woolpit,Care is very good,12/13/2021,5,"An excellent surgery where the care is very good and staff likewise.  The covid vaccinations given by the surgery were brilliant, such a smooth process with easy booking and systems in place on the days too. Its been great for each of the vaccinations. The disabled access around the back of the surgery isn't great for a wheelchair as there is a big kerb to negotiate."
Woolpit,"Children's area is good, GP fantastic",9/17/2019,4,"I like the children's area.
If I want a specific doctor I have to wait up to 4 weeks. My named doctor is fantastic.
I'm a bit concerned about the new houses going up and the effect on the surgery."
Woolpit,Clock needed in waiting room,10/12/2021,4,"I've had some problems picking up my medication from the pharmacy. I was at the surgery for an appointment late in the afternoon but the pharmacy wouldn't let me take my meds home with me and said they could only give them to me the next morning when I was due to pick them up, this seemed a little strict. There's no clock in the waiting room so when you have a covid vaccination and have to wait 15 mins you're not sure when you can go."
Woolpit,Complex needs not addressed,9/27/2022,3,"I have complex health needs and I find that not having any continuity of care with a doctor makes things more difficult as they have differing opinions. I've also had appointments and rather than dealing with the reason I came in for they treat the simpler issues as its easier to address, so the more complex issues don't get addressed. Individually there are some great staff but the phone calls and consultations don't help with managing my health issues."
Woolpit,Confidentiality no longer happening,6/7/2018,1,Receptionists have been informed to ask patients what their problem is and why they want to see a doctor. If patients don't comply with this they wont be gived an appointment. I for one will not be attending this surgery again as I don't feel it is receptionsts place to make decisions or comments about patients personal information.
Woolpit,Conflicting views,2/27/2020,3,"GP's seem to have conflicting views about certain medications for me. The waiting time to get an appointment can be up to 2-3 weeks otherwise I can come up sit and wait as an urgent case, I have been waiting 50 mins so far today."
Woolpit,"Confusion around blood tests, and a inconvenience",5/25/2017,4,"Woolpit surgery are asking patients to go to West Suffolk Hospital for blood tests now, which isn't great but is manageable.   I asked the nurse when I had my last check and she said they weren't doing them at the surgery although I have heard other people are still having them done there, this is confusing."
Woolpit,Continuity is lacking,9/27/2022,3,"I have a long-term condition, and I find the continuity is lacking. It means I've lost confidence in what I'm being told as it varies from person to person and each has a different view on how to proceed."
Woolpit,Could be better,12/5/2022,2,I spent 25 minutes on the phone and then had to fight for a doctors appointment. The information I was given by the doctor wasn't very clear and I was made to feel a nuisance when I needed help. I do feel sorry for the receptionists as they are the ones taking the brunt of it.
Woolpit,Covid vaccinations great,12/13/2021,5,I've only needed to come to the surgery in the last year for my covid vaccinations which have all been very well organised and the staff really polite.
Woolpit,Covid vaccinations great,10/12/2021,5,"I'm new at the practice but have been impressed by the covid vaccination programme here, such a simple process and well run."
Woolpit,Didn't move home to stay with this surgery,2/5/2019,5,"We were going to move home but decided not to because of this positive experience of this surgery. 
Car parking is an issue though, difficult to park."
Woolpit,Difficult to call,12/23/2022,3,Its difficult to call and get through to the surgery and I've waited half an hour at times. To see someone specific to do a certain procedure has entailed a 3 week wait but the care and treatment from staff is very good.  Its a five star practice but the process of getting appointments is more difficult now.
Woolpit,Difficulty getting appointment.,9/18/2019,2,Prescriptions never seem to be ready at the right time. I find getting an appointment difficult - you have to wait several weeks sometimes. I find the receptionists are a bit grumpy at times. I think there are too many patients at this surgery.
Woolpit,Doctor is good,2/26/2020,4,"The doctor is very good, I can get to see the same GP unless they are on holiday which is good. I am concerned about the number of new houses that are going to be built and how they cope with the extra people. Medical staff generally here are very good. It does take a long time for them to answer the phone. Car Park is too small."
Woolpit,Doctors and health centre good,12/5/2022,5,"The doctors and the health centre as a whole are good and I've been able to get a face to face when needed. The appointment process works well and the care provided is good, so I'm happy."
Woolpit,Doctors are very very good,2/26/2020,4,I wait often on the phone for over 10 mins before it is answered. Sometimes I have to wait 4-5 weeks for a routine appointment. I do feel that the doctors are very very good here. Front desk staff can be changeable in their attitude. Car Park is too small.
Woolpit,Doctors very good.,10/8/2017,5,"The doctors are very good and supportive. Called the  other morning for a home visit and was seen with in a couple of hours, great."
Woolpit,Doing a good job,12/23/2022,4,"There is often a long queue on the phone, I was 16th today but although it is frustrating I do prefer having the queue and knowing where you are in it.  I'm happy with the call backs from doctors and the appointments with nurses are fine to get in advance. The staff are all good, helpful and friendly, nothing really needs to change."
Woolpit,Easy to get appointments,12/23/2022,5,"It's nice and easy to get appointments and even the wait on the phone this morning wasn't too bad, I was 8th and had about a 15 minute wait.  I spoke to the Care Navigatior, had a quick call back with the GP and was asked to come down to the surgery for an appointment so its all worked really well."
Woolpit,Easy to get appointments,2/26/2020,5,"I got my appointment within one day, I am very happy with them."
Woolpit,ES Appointments when needed,12/23/2022,4,Appointments are available when needed but the waits on the phone to get through to the surgery can be quite long but the important thing is appointments are available when you do. I'm happy with the staff and considering the situation they are all doing pretty well as they are very busy.
Woolpit,Excellent,12/5/2022,5,The triage process works very well and I like being able to talk to a doctor but I'm unsure how I would get on if I needed a face to face appointment.
Woolpit,Excellent,12/13/2021,5,"No issues with getting prescriptions and I like the text message that is sent to say everything is ready to collect. Staff in reception are amazing, kind and helpful and I never have any issues. The new car park is great."
Woolpit,Excellent,9/14/2017,5,"They are quick and efficient. I'm having cancer treatment at the moment and they've been great at sorting out any issues I've had with side effects, making sure I have everything I need."
Woolpit,Excellent,3/20/2017,5,"District nurses have been great.  They've been out 3 times recently.  The only thing is that they will say they will visit but don't say when, which makes it difficult to arrange things"
Woolpit,excellent,10/10/2016,5,"staff friendly, good waiting times"
Woolpit,Excellent,8/9/2016,5,"Dr. on  call arrived immediately after the previous appt. Gave thorough examination & explanation of diagnosis, prescribed appropriate drugs and advice"
Woolpit,Excellent,8/15/2016,5,The nurses are good because they know me so well.  My doctor knows me well and if you ring up you normally get an appointment the same day
Woolpit,Excellent,6/11/2015,5,They take good care of me and are most thorough.  They are always very couerteous and understanding
Woolpit,Excellent,9/10/2015,5,Very proactive and cannot speak more highly of them.
Woolpit,Excellent,8/14/2015,5,I've always had very good treatment
Woolpit,Excellent and can always get appointment,9/21/2017,5,t can always get an appointment with someone when needed.  It's a teaching practice and the trainee GPS are always very good
Woolpit,Excellent but hard to park,3/20/2017,5,Difficult to park at the surgery.  The care is very good and the nurseshave been wonderful treating me over the last 6 months
Woolpit,Excellent but hard to see own GP. Like the walk in clinic,9/21/2017,5,Been very lucky to get to see my GP.  Means that I have to book appointments almost a month in advance.  The care received is very good as I have a very good doctor.  The walk in clinic is very good too and enables you to see someone when needed.
Woolpit,Excellent but sometimes can't see GP of choice,9/21/2017,5,If you call for help they will always get the GP to call you back or you can see the nurse.  It's a good practice;  just can be difficult to see the GP of your choice
Woolpit,Excellent GP,9/17/2019,5,"GP is so compassionate, over and above.  Absolutely brilliant.  Has done regular home visits when someone has been very unwell."
Woolpit,excellent overall,8/14/2015,5,On occasions I've felt that staff have not listened to my concerns
Woolpit,Excellent surgery,2/5/2019,5,"We feel this surgery saved our lives identifying serious conditions early and rectifying and referring on. Excellent surgery, could not speak high enough. 
Dementia - would like one person to help navigate through the services. DIST are excellent service."
Woolpit,Exceptional,9/2/2016,5,The service I have received at Woolpit has never been anything but exceptional. They always got the extra mile to help
Woolpit,Exemplary service,2/5/2019,5,If you need to see a doctor you can see someone on the say it's very good exemplary service here
Woolpit,Explaining on the phone not easy,9/17/2021,4,I would like to see the return to face to face appointments as I find explaining symptoms and issues over the phone difficult. I was only offered a call back and a face to face appointment didn't appear to be an option. Other than this it's working well for me.
Woolpit,Explanations lacking,8/8/2022,3,The phone lines are very busy so you end up waiting on the phone for quite a while and it's not just first thing but at different times during the day. I've been referred but have had no explanation as to why I've been referred. I've been diagnosed with a new condition but I haven't been able to see my GP to have things explained to me.  Medication is also often not available when it's been requested but you only find out when you visit the surgery to pick them up.
Woolpit,Fantastic,9/14/2022,5,Everything for me works well and I have no issues getting medication. The care provided by GPs is also good.
Woolpit,Feel there's a lack of appointments,12/5/2022,3,"I feel that there are a lack of face to face appointments available. Calling the surgery can mean a long wait of up to 60 minutes which is frustrating.  Antibiotics are now given out with out an examination which seems against the advice pre covid. My daughter was expecting a call back from the surgery at some point during the day and when they called she was already on the phone to the hospital. She called the surgery back straight away and was told she would have to wait a further 1 1/2 weeks for a new telephone appointment , that seems very inflexible."
Woolpit,Four weeks to get appointment but care is very good,9/21/2017,4,It took four weeks to get an appointment for a medication review. Care is very good but the service will be over whelmed when the new housing is built.
Woolpit,Frustrating trying to call surgery,12/23/2022,4,"Getting through on the phone is frustrating and I was 21st in line today, waiting 20 mins. The call back by the GP was very quick and now I'm seeing them too. I've contacted the surgery twice in the last two weeks but the telephone chats haven't addressed the issues so I've had to call again to day and was more insistent that I needed to be seen. Treatment and the nurses have been very good and I see them regularly. It's a very busy surgery and there are a lot of extra houses going up locally."
Woolpit,Generally good,12/13/2021,4,I do find that  you are not seen face to face in the first instance. You have do have to have a phone call back from the doctor but other than that it works well.
Woolpit,Generally happy but weekend support.is poor.,2/5/2019,4,Very happy with the surgery but there have been occasions when they have needed GP assistance at weekends and were unable to get help.
Woolpit,Generally quite happy,6/18/2019,5,"If you do want to see the same doctor it can mean a 2 week wait, but you are offered call backs from them which works well. For urgent or on the day appointments you will get seen.
Preventative checks like breast screening and cervical smears are good and not long waiting times either.
Generally quite happy with the surgery, the change to the reception area makes it much better and feel more spacious.
Smoking clinic works well, good advice and support provided by the nurse over the initial phase."
Woolpit,Getting an appointment can be difficult,1/22/2016,4,As a carer (live in) I'm very restricted when I can attend appointments (certain days off only). Depending who you talk to this can make getting an appointment very difficult.  When I first moved to the area it took a number of visits to get everything set up.
Woolpit,Getting appointments is not a problem,6/9/2016,5,Appointments are on time but they will give you more time if needed.  Getting appointments is not a problem but if you want to see a particular GP it may be a longer wait.  Very friendly nice staff.  The pharmacy is very good too.
Woolpit,"Getting appointments is OK, different doctors",6/18/2019,5,"Getting an emergency appointment on the day hasn't been too bad, but I've had an ongoing issues for the past few weeks and when I tried to see the same doctor for continuity, I couldn't be seen until the end of the  month. Today I've been given another appointment with someone different. When staff answer the phone it's normally done quite quickly and they explain options to you."
Woolpit,Getting appointments isn't bad,9/27/2022,4,"To get appointments isn't bad, the phones can be busy but the telephone consultations work well and address the issues so I'm happy."
Woolpit,Getting to see a GP is difficult,9/17/2021,4,I've had a fall and I don't really know how to get a doctor to see me. I've been told I can do an econsult or have a phone call but not sure how these will help when I need to be seen.
Woolpit,Gone smoothly,9/17/2021,4,"I've recently moved to the area so only just registering at the practice but so far the contact I've had with staff has been good, they've been helpful and friendly and the process has gone well."
Woolpit,good,7/3/2019,4,"Easily accessible.  Reception/admin staff came across as sharp and ""at the end of their teather"". But GP & medical staff very positive"
Woolpit,good,7/3/2019,4,Very good surgery.  Car park a bit small though.  We live in Thurston and really need a surgery there as more and more houses are being built in the area
Woolpit,Good but long wait to see own GP,9/21/2017,4,"Three week wait to see our GP and to get a telephone consultation can be very difficult.  On two occasins when trying to book an appointment I've had the phone put down on me.  It ring,  you hear someone pick it up but then the phone gets put down again.  Often the front desk isn't manned and you have to ring a bell, but it still takes time for someone to come outs"
Woolpit,Good but prefer to see own GP,9/21/2017,4,It's very important to me that I can see my own doctor.  This is difficult and can take a few weeks.  The increased buildiing in the villages is a real concern considering how stretched services currently are.  How will they cope in the future?  More doctors are needed
Woolpit,Good care over 20 years,9/17/2021,5,More recently I've been having blood tests which have been quick to book and arrange and I'm confident with the process in place that if I need an appointment with a doctor I'd get one.  The drive through vaccination process has worked brilliantly.
Woolpit,Good communication,12/13/2021,5,Have good communication with both the GP's and pharmacy and it works well for me as a carer. They are always happy to talk things through which is great.
Woolpit,Good covid vaccinations,10/12/2021,5,I've had all my covid vaccinations here at the surgery and it was really well run and went really smoothly. Other than that I haven't used the surgery for an appointment in a long time.
Woolpit,"Good GPs, listen well and have time for you",9/18/2019,5,"I am very happy here.
Good doctors who listen well and always have time for you.
I do online appointments - if I want a specific doctor I would have to wait 3-4 weeks, if I'm not fussy I can get to see them the next day.
The turnover of doctors is quite quick....it seems they come to train here."
Woolpit,Good surgery,12/14/2016,4,My diabetes is well controlled by the surgery.  The staff explain things really well and I get to see the same GP all the time
Woolpit,Great,6/19/2023,5,Called at 8 am this morning and got an appointment straight away so very happy with how the surgery is working.
Woolpit,Great,10/12/2021,5,Can get appointments when they are needed. I called this morning about my child and was asked to come down straight away so it works really well from my perspective. Really can't fault the surgery at all.
Woolpit,Great as ever,12/13/2021,5,"Very happy with the surgery, medication is always ready on time and the covid vaccinations including booster sessions have been so easy to arrange and such a well run process."
Woolpit,"Great, forward thinking health centre.",7/28/2015,5,"Nice environment, on-line bookings, repeat prescriptions and digital arrivals. GPs listen and help you decide what you want by offering choices.
The Health centre is let down by the pharmacy which is currently dysfunctional. Long queues, staff can't find mis-filed prescriptions and I witnessed someone being given medication they had ceased several months before. If they had been elderly, with e.g. dementia they may not have spotted this and taken too much or the wrong medication."
Woolpit,Happy so far,12/23/2022,4,I'm a new patient so haven't had much contact so far but everything so far has been great. I had to wait  a little for my first appointment but I've now had all the tests I needed and I'm seeing the same doctor again to discuss everything.
Woolpit,Happy with how it works,9/17/2021,5,"I called this morning and spoke to a doctor who then called me in to the surgery. I've been seen really quickly and I'm really happy with how it has all worked, being triaged and speaking to the doctor means you only come in if necessary but they will see you. The care has been great too with staff explaining things well."
Woolpit,Happy with the surgery,9/14/2022,5,"It's easy to make appointments, especially for blood tests, which is the main reason I come to the surgery. Its a good practice, and I can't really fault it."
Woolpit,Has got so much better lately,7/17/2019,5,"Over the past few months my health has declined and I have been visiting the GP more frequently. The reception team have really improved compared to last year, and I'm finding them exceptionally helpful and friendly. I called today as I was very concerned about a blood test I had and the receptionist very kindly put me through to the GP which was very helpful and put my mind at rest. My GP is brilliant, very understanding and thorough, and other GPs I've seen have also been very good."

I called today as I was very concerned about a blood test I had and the receptionist very kindly put me through to the GP which was very helpful and put my mind at rest. My GP is brilliant, very understanding and thorough, and other GPs I've seen have also been very good."
Woolpit,Having to go for blood tests elsewhere not good.,5/25/2017,4,My husband has regular INR blood tests at the surgery and this has continued since the phlebotomists have stopped visiting the surgery.  He has the test so regularly that going to WSH would not be good at all
Woolpit,I am satisfied with this surgery,9/18/2019,4,"I am satisfied with this surgery.
However, I was a little frustrated to find on arrival that my GP is already running 10mins late."
Woolpit,I did not like the attitude of nurse,2/27/2020,4,"The doctors have been very good and some of the front desk staff have a very nice attitude, but I had a situation about 3 months ago when a new nurse was trying to remove some stitches from me and the senior nurse's attitude towards the new nurse in front of patients was poor she basically ""put her in her place"" this should not happen in front of patients.  Car Park is too small for how many people use this health centre."
Woolpit,I feel well looked after and my GP listens.,9/18/2019,4,"I feel well looked after here.
I like my GP, he listens well.
I found the staff in the pharmacy to be quite unhelpful when I asked for some advice on a certain medication. I was told ""I do not have the time to explain"""
Woolpit,I had even to charge my mobile while waiting,6/19/2023,1,"After waiting over 1hr to reach a receptionist, I do NOT want to discuss my health with a receptionist. If calling for an appointment I will discuss ONLY my health with a profesional, NEVER with a receptionist, so please, STOP asking me why I need to see a DR or nurse. Thank you"
Woolpit,I waited for 45mins for call to be answered,2/13/2023,1,"When i spoke to the health care practitioner and told them that I was in pain and have had little or no sleep for a few weeks and would like to talk to a doctor I was given a
phone appointment for the 9th March, today being the 13th February.  I'm not able to carry on with the pain till this time so i'm going to have to go to A & E and block up the emergency room to get to see a doctor because of this."
Woolpit,Issues sorted,10/12/2021,5,"The surgery has been alright, I've had issues but they've all been sorted whether its been referrals to hospital or getting problems sorted here. Staff are very nice and helpful and the covid booster session was very well organised."
Woolpit,"It's brilliant here, doctors are great.",9/18/2019,5,"It's just brilliant here. The Doctors are great, but you do need to wait for specific doctors, sometimes several weeks.
I am a bit concerned about how the surgery will be impacted by the new houses."
Woolpit,Lack of confidentility,10/13/2018,2,"I find it unacceptable that receptionists have access to our medical records, are making diagnosis that they are not qualified to make and are writing letters that medical secretaries normally write. Is it any wonder the mistakes they are making and patients are being left to suffer and end up in hospital and costing the NHS more than it should have done."
Woolpit,Limited access to general appointments,6/18/2019,2,"No general appointments are available for the rest of the month but for on the day appointments you are told that it could be a 2-2.5hour wait to be seen. I can't see why the surgery can't say when you will be seen on the day, surely there is still an appointment system of sorts. 
I've also had issues with treatment given for an issue and was hospitalised as a result. I was told by a doctor that they couldn't do any more and that I should go to A&E.
I would like some clarity around how the room system works, I've had urgent appointments but gone to the blue rooms and also at other times been seen in the red area."
Woolpit,Long wait on the phone,12/13/2021,3,It took an hour to get through on the phone the other morning which is a long time when you are paying to be on hold.
Woolpit,"Long wait to see own GP, emergencies quicker",9/18/2019,4,"Waiting for appointment with your own doctor can take 1-2wks, but emergencies are quicker.
We are impressed with the surgery overall. I would say it's the best one I've been to.
Car park is too small."
Woolpit,Longer waits for non urgent matters,12/23/2022,4,I've had a 3 week wait for a non urgent issue and to see a specific doctor but generally phone calls happen with in a day and in most circumstances these work well. In most circumstances I'm happy to see any of the staff I'm just not a fan of the process to get an appointment now  and I don't understand why they can't change back to how it was and why Care Navigators have to ask what is wrong with me.
Woolpit,Lovely doctor,12/5/2022,5,"The surgery is very good. I've seen a lovely doctor, the reception staff were nice and helpful and I've had an appointment when I've needed one. I sometimes just need advice so the phone calls back work really well. Any changes to my medication are easy to do and its a good surgery."
Woolpit,Lovely refurbished surgery,2/5/2019,4,Reception staff on the phone can be a bit sharp sometimes. It's a lovely surgery - brand new refurbished (environment). It's good that you can come and see the doctor on the day if needed.
Woolpit,Lovely surgery,2/13/2018,5,"A lovely surgery, I have no complaints at all and you can always get an appointment when you need one."
Woolpit,Lovely waiting area,2/26/2020,5,"I am in for a diabetic check up today, I find the waiting area lovely. I can usually get an appointment easily, I always try to ask for the lovely doctor who went away and then came back. The car park is too small."
Woolpit,Magnificent,4/8/2015,5,My GP has been magnificent throughout all of my treatment. The physio bed at the surgery doesn't seem that clean.
Woolpit,Mixed experience,3/5/2022,3,I've face to face appointments but they don't seem to address the issues and nothing improves but for my daughter they've been very quick to act and referred her to hospital to have things checked out.
Woolpit,Music on phone not good,9/27/2022,4,The phone lines are busy and the music that plays while you wait drives me crackers. To see a doctor for non urgent issues can entail a long wait.
Woolpit,Never had a bad experience,11/15/2019,5,I have never had a bad experience. Very good service.
Woolpit,No issues,12/13/2021,5,"Once you call and get through you get everything sorted and there are no long waits either. The surgery have done really well considering the situation, appointments are available when needed so it all works well for me."
Woolpit,No major issues,9/27/2022,5,I've had no issues getting appointments when I've needed them and the staff have been great. You can tell the surgery is busy as there can be queues on the phone.
Woolpit,No problems,12/23/2022,5,"My annual review is being done today and I've had great support from the nurse with my diabetes. Staff are so helpful, friendly and easy to talk to . I can't think of any faults with the surgery."
Woolpit,not easy to get appointments these days,8/9/2021,2,Cannot get my own doctor even in emergency. No doctor available no nurse available to give 3mth injection
Woolpit,not easy to get appointments these days,12/5/2021,4,"Never speak to same doctor, or get to see own doctor at the moment. With complicated medical history having to explain each time is very uncomfortable and never get the right answers.  Have been sent to hospital a couple of times for treatment instead.  Would prefer to see my own doctor face to face"
Woolpit,Not enough disabled car park spaces,2/26/2020,5,"Staff are very helpful and obliging, doctors are very good at what they do, appointments are easy fir me to get. The only thing really is the car park is not big enough and there are not enough disabled spaces."
Woolpit,Opening times on the website are not correct,1/17/2023,1,"The ques are unacceptable at the pharmacy, you can que for up to an hour to collect your meds.  We went to look at the pharmacy at Coombs and they said they never get a que.  WHY is Woolpit so bad?"
Woolpit,Outstanding - care and staff,3/10/2017,5,"This GP practice is outstanding.  There is a short waiting time to get an appointment plus an emergency service for urgent needs.  The staff are always helpful, friendly,knowledgable and patient"
Woolpit,Over worked but do what is needed,11/4/2016,5,Whilst this practice is over worked they do what is needed - I have no gripe. Like all services it is over worked they need outreach centres in the local villages and better transport links.
Woolpit,Overall good,9/23/2022,5,"GPs are more approachable and everyone I've seen has been excellent. 
The changes to the reception area are really good and spacious. It looks fresh and helps people to be able to get around.
To get an emergency appointment is OK, but it's difficult to see the same doctor for ongoing issues. If you do want to see the one person it can take a while to get the appointment. Can be quick to medicate for issues and when I've been given medication for little explanation or detail of possible side effects have been dismissed. 
Receptionists are more helpful and less likely to put up walls."
Woolpit,Pharmacy slow and inefficient. GP dismissive.,6/19/2023,1,"Trying to collect repeat prescriptions always slow and often not ready even if I have a text to say it's ready. Staff too busy talking about how tanned their ankles are. When I asked GP how to book in for blood test and would he send me a text with a link he said 'I can do, no skin off my nose'. Very rude and dismissive."
Woolpit,"Pharmacy waiting times excessive, stressful",2/15/2023,1,"For many years the pharmacy has appeared to be cramped, chaotic and under-staffed.Whenever you visit it you do so with apprehension because you know you are in for a long wait,minimum 15mins. max 1 hour. It needs re-organising so as to meet the needs of patients for a fast reliable service.The staff are always friendly and helpful the organisation is not their fault.Hanging around in long queues can only increase the risk of infection spread and stress to patients or their carers."
Woolpit,Pharmacy working well,9/17/2021,4,Its working well at the moment. I only really need my repeat prescriptions but it works well and is relatively quick. Staff are also fine when you are talking to them.
Woolpit,Phone answered in 2 minutes. Excellent!,3/16/2023,5,"Phoned at 8.25am ish about an occasional health issue. Phone answered by a very helpful person in 2 minutes. Talked through, plan made. All sorted in a few minutes. Excellent service."
Woolpit,Phone appointments work well,12/13/2021,5,"Phone appointments work well, I don't come much so I don't think anything needs to change as it all works well."
Woolpit,Phone calls have worked well,12/5/2022,4,I haven't needed an appointment in person with a GP but I've had phone calls with a doctor and they've worked really well as they mean you don't have to come to the surgery for every little thing. The doctors also advise and explain issues well.
Woolpit,Phone is busy in mornings,12/5/2022,4,"There can be 20 people in the queue on the phone, they are doing their best on reception but not speaking to a doctor is an issue. On the other hand we should appreciate the NHS more and not see it as a right, we're very lucky in this country."
Woolpit,Phone is difficult,12/13/2021,5,"I haven't had any issues getting appointments but I do find it difficult using the phone as my hearing isn't good, my wife tends to do all the calls for me. Other than that its all been good, getting to see someone hasn't been a problem and the staff have all been great."
Woolpit,Phones busy,9/27/2022,4,The phones are busy. I was 18th in the queue this morning  and getting an appointment to see a doctor isn't easy.  I do find talking on the phone easy to do although it can be several days waiting for the call. The pharmacy does have long queues and I wasn't aware that it is not part of the surgery.  My appointment with the nurse today was good and addressed the issues.
Woolpit,Pleased with service,9/27/2022,5,"Overall, as a new patient I'm very happy with the service offered by the surgery. The only thing is that you can end up being on the phone for a long time."
Woolpit,"Poor car park, staff nice.",2/5/2019,3,"Car park is very challenging, have to come early to get parked.
Very happy with the surgery and the staff, no concerns."
Woolpit,Poor communication with the hospital,3/5/2022,2,After being discharged from hospital I had to chase the surgery to get the medication I needed to be on. Apparently the surgery hadn't received anything from the hospital so were unaware of the situation. I'm also not happy that you don't get to see a doctor as standard although the telephone calls to the practice more recently have sorted some medication problems out.
Woolpit,Prescription delay,7/24/2015,3,The wait for the prescriptions can be quite long and there have been problems with wrong medication being given.
Woolpit,Prescriptions not signed,9/27/2022,3,It's been quite difficult to get a face to face appointment but to talk to a doctor on the phone has been easy. I've been happy with the care but access is more of an issue. The nurses are lovely and they book my next appointment when I see them. I prefer to try to see the same GP if at all possible as it makes it simpler.  On four occasions my prescription hasn't been signed and medication has then been delayed and it also means I have to come back and forth to the surgery.
Woolpit,Pretty good,8/14/2015,4,"Getting to see your own doctor has become a bit more difficult but you can always see a doctor when you
need to."
Woolpit,Process seems a bit over the top,9/17/2021,4,"The system in place at the pharmacy does seem a little over the top in comparison to other places you visit. I am concerned that I needed to wait for 2 hours for a call back from a doctor as I was sent to hospital but could've been there earlier if I hadn't been waiting. The receptionist are lovely, smiley and cheerful."
Woolpit,Quicker to visit surgery to book,9/27/2022,4,I have tried to call the surgery for appointments but there can be long waits so I find it is quicker to come to the surgery and speak to reception and to get an appointment booked. There can also be long waits if you want a physical appointment but they are doing their best considering the circumstances.
Woolpit,Really good but...,10/19/2016,5,It is really good but the only downside is that in the last year the waiting time to get an appointment with a chosen doctor has gone from one to three weeks. There aren't many female doctors in comparison to the number of male one. But otherwise a fantastic service and I do have to go there a lot.
Woolpit,Reception staff can be a bit blunt,2/26/2020,3,"Doctors have always had a good attitude I have found, reception staff can sometimes be a little blunt but they do get busy so maybe that is the reason. I was waiting for 1 1/2 hours for a dietitian recently and she did not know I was even there waiting as she had not been informed, this needs to be looked at for the future."
Woolpit,Rubbish,6/13/2023,2,"Recently moved and Woolpit is shocking! Slow and rude, awful if you have any chronic needs! Would move back to my old GP if I could! 3 interactions and all of them have left me feeling worse."
Woolpit,Rude receptionist,2/3/2023,1,The receptionist needs better customer service training.  She can’t hear because she is wearing a headset and expects patients to shout their private business out loud rather than taking her headset off to deal with people.
Woolpit,slow and inaccurate,4/25/2023,1,"difficulties getting an appointment 
no routine appointments available online or via reception only eConsult. When I did get the appointment with a nurse, the medication I was going to be prescribed wasn't and 1 week after my appointment I'm still waiting,"
Woolpit,Spot on,7/13/2023,5,"The service provided is excellent. They are absolutely spot on as you can get appointments when needed and the system in place works so well, I really can't fault them, the care provided is great."
Woolpit,Staff are amicable and have time.,9/18/2019,5,"They have lots of time for me here.
I feel the service is linked well to the hospital. I'm very impressed.
I find the staff are very amicable and very useful.
Prescriptions are not always ready on time."
Woolpit,Staff are polite,2/5/2019,5,They can always get you in on the day if it's urgent. Reception staff are very polite and never feel rushed.
Woolpit,Staff do a good job,12/13/2021,4,There are no big issues at the surgery and staff do a great job. The phone lines through to the pharmacy are busy but you do get through in the end. I've had my diabetic checks completed over the phone which has actually been fine.
Woolpit,Staff polite on phone and GPs good,9/18/2019,4,"Polite on phone and the GPs are good.
I prefer to book online but the appointments are limited until more are released.
I like my surgery - no major issues."
Woolpit,"Surgery runs well, good explanations",6/18/2019,5,"Can get on the day appointments easily. I go through on the phone quickly.  Happy to see any of the doctors or nurses, they explain things really well. The surgery runs well and I am happy with it all. The changes to the reception area are good."
Woolpit,Surgery works well,6/14/2016,5,"To see any doctor for non urgent issues does take up to 2 -3 weeks. 
Online booking does work well and it's easy to navigate through the system. 
Getting a nurse appointment today was good, it was booked a week ago. At times the reception admin staff can be a little abrupt, but they do have to ask their questions and need to go through them.
Having both on the day and advance appointments available works really well."
Woolpit,Takes 2 weeks plus to get appointment,2/26/2020,4,Modern and clean surgery makes a pleasant environment. Car Park is too small for the size of the health centre. It takes about 2 weeks plus to get an appointment but I have got an emergency appointment today and I have to sit and wait I have already been here 1 1/4 hours!
Woolpit,Telephones busy,10/12/2021,4,More or less can get appointments when needed and either a face to face or phone call. The telephones are busy to get through and you do have to wait a long time.
Woolpit,The staff attitude is generally good,3/8/2015,4,The staff attitude is generally good however sometimes they are a bit blunt - Would prefer another surgery in Thurston.
Woolpit,The surgery is great,12/5/2022,4,Its a great surgery but there is a real lack of disabled parking outside the main entrance.  There are always people waiting to be able to park in the limited number of bays so that they can take people in to the surgery more easily.
Woolpit,The wait is too long,2/5/2019,3,On line booking an appointment had to wait 2 weeks. Also to have a call back from GP the wait is too long. GP didn't contact cardiologist in the time frame expected this was disappointing.
Woolpit,This is the best surgery,2/5/2019,5,This is the best surgery! They are always on time. Treatment and care is very good. Also given good referral when needed. But the car park is horrendous.
Woolpit,This surgery is doing a good job.,9/18/2019,5,"Everybody is so pleasant and helpful here.
I book appointments online and I cant find my GP that I want.
Transport to the surgery from Elmswell is challenging."
Woolpit,"Through, attentive, professional care provided.",7/4/2023,4,"I’m new to the National Health Service, having just moved here from the US.  Thus far my experience has been good.  Friendly, efficient staff.  It is a bit of a wait at times in the Pharmacy which is understandable.  I’ve recently signed on for the automatic prescription system that I believe will greatly reduce my wait times and allow the overworked staff more time to accomplish their tasks.  It’s been a pleasure knowing you all, you are superb."
Woolpit,Unable to speak to Dr.,7/4/2023,1,Receptionist wouldn't arrange call back by Dr. Told to use e contact which is ineffective or Pharmacy would call back between 9 &12 tomorrow (now today) as they are more qualified to deal with medication queries. Surprise no call back. Eventually contacted local independent pharmacy for information
Woolpit,Unacceptable,2/26/2020,3,"My blood pressure was identified as being very high at the hospital and I was advised at the hospital to make sure I see my doctor to follow this up. I phoned up and I was told by the receptionist that I would have to wait until almost 1 month time, So I had to come in as an emergency today as this was the only way I could get to see the GP sooner, I find this really unacceptable."
Woolpit,"Uncaring, lack communication, unorganised.",10/14/2020,2,"Feels as though patients are an inconvenience and have not got time for them. Are rude and off hand. Do not explain matters in consultations, know everything and know nothing as do not listen as seems have more important matters on their minds. Has changed for the worse and not due to Covid virus."
Woolpit,Urgent appointments good,9/27/2022,4,"Appointments for urgent issues are good and the surgery are very good at rolling out vaccine clinics for flu and covid, always goes very smoothly."
Woolpit,Used on line ordering and vending machine,12/5/2023,5,Service (on only one experience) very good.  On time and accurate.  Would recommend to others..
Woolpit,Very accommodating and thorough.,9/18/2019,5,"I find the staff very accommodating here and they will always check things if one person is not sure.
The receptionist can sometimes be a bit sharp."
Woolpit,Very approachable staff,2/5/2019,5,"I can relate easily to the practice staff they are very approachable. I would like a better, larger car park though. Often long queues at the pharmacy to collect medications."
Woolpit,Very Good,9/13/2022,5,I have regular blood tests and I'm able to book these whenever they are needed. I already have my next appointment booked so it all works really well for me.
Woolpit,Very good,9/13/2022,5,"It's been very good this morning. I called, and then I had a call back from a GP which has resulted in an appointment so I've been very happy with the care and experience in general from the surgery."
Woolpit,Very good,8/21/2018,5,"The surgery is very good, I like that you can get appointments on the day or in advance and you can see a doctor when you need to. Staff are alway friendly and helpful."
Woolpit,Very good doctors,2/26/2020,4,"Its the doctors that make this surgery a good one for me. Getting an appointment can be a bit of challenge at times, you can have to wait up to 4 weeks for a non urgent appointment. Getting through on the phone also can be a bit frustrating it takes between 10-30 mins, online booking works OK so long as there are appointments."
Woolpit,Very good nurse,9/27/2022,4,"It's not easy to make an appointment due to the telephones, but I do get a very good service overall from the nurse I see."
Woolpit,Very good surgery,12/13/2021,4,"Everything from prescriptions to appointments all work well and are very quick, the only issue is the time spent on the phone but everything does get sorted out."
Woolpit,Very good treatment and care,9/2/2016,4,"The care and treatment received has been very good, sometimes you do need to wait a little time but this is ok if other people need a bit longer."
Woolpit,"Very good, works well",8/21/2018,5,"The longer opening hours are really good and make it easier to get appointments and it is really appreciated. You can always get an appointment, maybe not with your own doctor the same day but if its urgent you can get an appointment with any of the doctors. The online appointment booking and the telephone call back are really good and work well. The pharmacy at the surgery isn't always great."
Woolpit,Very happy,9/20/2021,5,I spoke with the doctor this morning and I now have a face to face appointment with them tomorrow to discuss my issues since my discharge from hospital. I'm very happy with the care provided by the surgery.
Woolpit,Very poor service from GP,7/27/2016,1,"My husband who has serious mental health issues and has previously been treated well at Woolpit had to make an emergency appointment as he was feeling suicidal and in need of accute mental health services. The GP disregarded his claim, advising that if my husband felt suicidal to 'tell his wife' and you'll feel better soon, get on with it. He only suggested a blood test as a last resort. My husband ended up in a&e that night, and eventually with the mental health crisis team which is where he should have been referred at his gp appointment."
Woolpit,Very well organised,12/13/2021,5,The staff are always polite and appointments are available when they are needed. I think they are doing a fantastic job at the moment.
Woolpit,Very well run,3/30/2016,5,"This is a very well run, professional surgery. Quick appointments and dedicated doctors."
Woolpit,Waiting on the phone,9/27/2022,4,The main issue at the surgery is the time spent waiting on the phone or at appointments when they are running behind.
Woolpit,"Waiting times can feel long, generally good",2/5/2019,4,"Feels I'm waiting too long at appointment. Car parking is a problem
Otherwise it's a good surgery."
Woolpit,Waits for mental health support,9/27/2022,3,I find getting mental health support difficult as its all done on the phone and getting through to the surgery is hard. I also find it difficult to discuss things on the phone and would prefer a face to face appointment. It has taken 3 weeks to get a call back about my mental health and I haven't been able to use the link worker here as they were not available when I last enquired.
Woolpit,Well organised,4/5/2022,4,"The surgery ran the covid operation very well, it was so well organised.  Luckily I don't need to use the surgery much for other issues but what they do do they do well."
Woolpit,When eventually got to see Dr. Good-experienc,11/18/2022,3,Very disappointed to have to wait 45mins on phone to Make a same day appointment for a sick 3yr old. Wanting to Make a routine appointment was a months wait. Then to read in Bury Free Press that 1 Doctor thinks the surgery could take on more patients!!!
Woolpit,Wonderful and a service to be proud of,8/2/2021,5,"We have been with this practice since 1979 and have never had a reason or cause the complain. Always diligent, always compassionate, always there for you."
Woolpit,Working well,4/5/2022,5,Its an amazing service with caring doctors and the system for getting appointments works really well. I like being able to talk to a GP and then being seen if needed.  Referrals have been quick and easy to get and I really can't fault the surgery.
Woolpit,Works really well,12/13/2021,5,It works very well and such a smooth process for the covid boosters with a quick booking process and delivery on the day. Overall the surgery is good and the staff are always polite and helpful.
Woolpit,Works well,12/23/2022,5,Works extremely well and I'm very confident that I can get an appointment when I need them as never had an issue. Especially with the covid jabs they've done a very good job. Its a very good surgery.
Woolpit,Works well for us,6/18/2019,5,"Managed the building work well, didn't impact on care. The car park is small and cramped and we've had the car hit previously. You get the right advice and care, I called yesterday and got an appointment the next day. The mix of on the day and advance appointments works well for us. The changes to the reception area are good and ti's made a positive difference."
Woolpit,Would've been 5stars before covid,12/23/2022,3,"I've had trouble getting face to face appointments and have mainly had call backs from the doctor which haven't always addressed the issues adequately. For today's appointment with a specific GP (female) I've had to wait three weeks. I'm happy and confident in the staff when I do see them but I would like the surgery to explain why they are unable to return to the pre covid system that was in place. The waiting room often looks very quiet, so I do wonder where everyone is."
Woolpit,Years of excellent health care,5/12/2021,5,Nothing more to add
Woolpit,Younger GPs are more helpful,2/5/2018,4,I have been a patient here for some years. It is pretty good all around and I think that now the younger GPs are more helpful than the older ones that I have seen.
